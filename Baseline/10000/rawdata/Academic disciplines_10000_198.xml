      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20693">'''Biodiversity Informatics''' is the application of [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] techniques to [[biodiversity|biodiversity information]] for improved management, presentation, discovery, exploration and analysis. It typically builds on a foundation of [[Biological classification|taxonomic]], [[biogeography|biogeographic]], or [[ecology|ecological]] information stored in digital form, which, with the application of modern computer techniques, can yield new ways to view and analyse existing information, as well as predictive models for information that does not yet exist (see [[environmental niche modelling|niche modelling]]). Biodiversity informatics is a relatively young discipline (the term was coined in or around 1992) but has hundreds of practitioners worldwide, including the numerous individuals involved with the design and construction of [[taxonomic database]]s. The term "Biodiversity Informatics" is generally used in the broad sense to apply to computerized handling of any biodiversity information; the somewhat broader term "[[bioinformatics]]" is often used synonymously with the computerized handling of data in the specialized area of [[molecular biology]].

== Overview ==

Biodiversity informatics (different but linked to bioinformatics) is the application of information technology methods to the problems of organizing, accessing, visualizing and analyzing primary biodiversity data. Primary biodiversity data is composed of names, observations and records of specimens, and genetic and morphological data associated to a specimen. Biodiversity informatics may also have to cope with managing information from unnamed taxa such as that produced by environmental sampling and sequencing of mixed-field samples. The term biodiversity informatics is also used to cover the [[computational problem]]s specific to the names of biological entities, such as the development of algorithms to cope with variant representations of identifiers such as species names and authorities, and the multiple classification schemes within which these entities may reside according to the preferences of different workers in the field, as well as the syntax and semantics by which the content in taxonomic databases can be made machine queryable and interoperable for biodiversity informatics purposes...

== History of the discipline ==

Biodiversity Informatics can be considered to have commenced with the construction of the first computerized [[taxonomic database]]s in the early 1970s, and progressed through subsequent developing of distributed search tools towards the late 1990s including the Species Analyst from Kansas University, the North American Biodiversity Information Network NABIN, CONABIO in Mexico, and others,&lt;ref name="Krishtalka2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Krishtalka L, Humphrey PS|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2000|title=Can Natural History Museums Capture the Future?|journal=BioScience|volume=50|pages=611–617|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1641/0006-3568%282000%29050%5B0611%3ACNHMCT%5D2.0.CO%3B2|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0611:CNHMCT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] in 2001, and the parallel development of a variety of [[niche modelling]] and other tools to operate on digitized biodiversity data from the mid-1980s onwards (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Peterson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Peterson AT, Vieglais D|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2001|title=Predicting Species Invasions Using Ecological Niche Modeling: New Approaches from Bioinformatics Attack a Pressing Problem|journal=BioScience|volume=51|pages=363–371|url=http://www.cria.org.br/eventos/mfmpe/19_20jun2002_docs/BioScience%202001.pdf|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0363:PSIUEN]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In September 2000, the U.S. journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] devoted a special issue to "Bioinformatics for Biodiversity",&lt;ref name="Science_Sep_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2000|title=Bioinformatics for Biodiversity?|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2229–2440|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol289/issue5488/index.dtl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the journal "Biodiversity Informatics" commenced publication in 2004, and several international conferences through the 2000s have brought together Biodiversity Informatics practitioners, including the London [http://www.e-biosphere09.org/ e-Biosphere] conference in June 2009. A supplement to the journal [[BMC Bioinformatics]] (Volume 10 Suppl 14&lt;ref name="BMC_Bioinformatics2009"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2009|title=Biodiversity Informatics|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=10 Suppl 14|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10?issue=S14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) published in November 2009 also deals with Biodiversity Informatics.

== History of the term ==

According to correspondence reproduced by Walter Berendsohn,&lt;ref name="BITheTerm"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bgbm.org/BioDivInf/TheTerm.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = "Biodiversity Informatics", The Term}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "Biodiversity Informatics" was coined by John Whiting in 1992 to cover the activities of an entity known as the Canadian Biodiversity Informatics Consortium, a group involved with fusing basic [[biodiversity]] information with [[environmental economics]] and geospatial information in the form of [[GPS]] and [[GIS]]. Subsequently, it appears to have lost any obligate connection with the GPS/GIS world and be associated with the computerized management of any aspects of biodiversity information (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Bisby2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bisby FA|year= 2000|title=The Quiet Revolution: Biodiversity Informatics and the Internet|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2309–2312|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5488/2309|doi=10.1126/science.289.5488.2309|pmid=11009408|issue=5488|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Current Biodiversity Informatics issues ==

=== Global list of all species ===

One major issue for biodiversity informatics at a global scale is the current absence of a complete master list of [[Global biodiversity|currently recognised species of the world]], although this is an aim of the [[Catalogue of Life]] project which has ca. 1.65 million species of an estimated 1.9 million described species in its [http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/ac 2016 Annual Checklist]. A similar effort for fossil taxa, the Paleobiology Database&lt;ref name="PaleoDB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://paleodb.org/| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = the Paleobiology Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents some 100,000+ names for fossil species, out of an unknown total number.

=== Genus and species scientific names as unique identifiers ===

Application of the [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] system of binomial nomenclature for [[species]], and uninomials for [[genus|genera]] and higher ranks, has led to many advantages but also problems with [[Homonym (biology)|homonyms]] (the same name being used for multiple taxa, either inadvertently or legitimately across multiple kingdoms), [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] (multiple names for the same taxon), as well as variant representations of the same name due to orthographic differences, minor spelling errors, variation in the manner of citation of author names and dates, and more. In addition, names can change through time on account of changing taxonomic opinions (for example, the correct generic placement of a species, or the elevation of a subspecies to species rank or vice versa), and also the circumscription of a taxon can change according to different authors' taxonomic concepts. One proposed solution to this problem is the usage of Life Science Identifiers ([[LSID]]s) for machine-machine communication purposes, although there are both proponents and opponents of this approach.

=== A consensus classification of organisms ===

Organisms can be classified in a multitude of ways (see main page [[Biological classification]]), which can create design problems for Biodiversity Informatics systems aimed at incorporating either a single or multiple classification to suit the needs of users, or to guide them towards a single "preferred" system. Whether a single consensus classification system can ever be achieved is probably an open question, however the Catalogue of Life has commissioned activity in this area&lt;ref name="CoL2009Gordon"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.catalogueoflife.org/info_hierarchy.php|accessdate = 2009-08-06|title = Towards a management hierarchy (classification) for the Catalogue of Life. Draft Discussion Document by Dr. Dennis P. Gordon, May 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808201530/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/info_hierarchy.php|archivedate = 2009-08-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been succeeded by a published system proposed in 2015 by M. Ruggiero and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero-et-al-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ruggiero, M.A. |author2=Gordon, D.P. |author3=Orrell, T.M. |author4=Bailly, N.  |author5=Bourgoin, T. |author6=Brusca, R.C. |display-authors=etal |year=2015 |title=A higher level classification of all living organisms |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=10 | issue = 4  |pages=e0119248 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0119248 |pmid=25923521 |pmc=4418965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobilizing primary biodiversity information ==

"Primary" biodiversity information can be considered the basic data on the occurrence and diversity of species (or indeed, any recognizable taxa), commonly in association with information regarding their distribution in either space, time, or both. Such information may be in the form of retained specimens and associated information, for example as assembled in the natural history collections of [[museum]]s and [[herbarium|herbaria]], or as observational records, for example either from formal faunal or floristic surveys undertaken by professional biologists and students, or as amateur and other planned or unplanned observations including those increasingly coming under the scope of [[citizen science]]. Providing online, coherent digital access to this vast collection of disparate primary data is a core Biodiversity Informatics function that is at the heart of regional and global biodiversity data networks, examples of the latter including [[OBIS]] and [[GBIF]].

As a secondary source of biodiversity data, relevant [[scientific literature]] can be parsed either by humans or (potentially) by specialized information retrieval algorithms to extract the relevant primary biodiversity information that is reported therein, sometimes in aggregated / summary form but frequently as primary observations in narrative or tabular form. Elements of such activity (such as extracting key taxonomic identifiers, keywording / [[index term]]s, etc.) have been practiced for many years at a higher level by selected [[academic databases and search engines]]. However, for the maximum Biodiversity Informatics value, the actual primary occurrence data should ideally be retrieved and then made available in a standardized form or forms; for example both the [[Plazi]] and [http://www.inotaxa.org/ INOTAXA] projects are transforming taxonomic literature into [[XML]] formats that can then be read by client applications, the former using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taxonx/ TaxonX-XML] and the latter using the taXMLit format. The [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] is also making significant progress in its aim to digitize substantial portions of the out-of-copyright taxonomic literature, which is then subjected to [[optical character recognition|OCR]] (optical character recognition) so as to be amenable to further processing using Biodiversity Informatics tools.

== Standards and protocols ==

In common with other data-related disciplines, Biodiversity Informatics benefits from the adoption of appropriate [[technical standard|standard]]s and [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] in order to support machine-machine transmission and interoperability of information within its particular domain. Examples of relevant standards include the [[Darwin Core]] [[XML]] [[XML schema|schema]] for specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data developed from 1998 onwards, plus extensions of the same, [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/ Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema], plus standards for [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/116/ Structured Descriptive Data] and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/ Access to Biological Collection Data] (ABCD); while data retrieval and transfer protocols include [http://digir.sourceforge.net/ DiGIR] (now mostly superseded) and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/449/ TAPIR] (TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval). Many of these standards and protocols are currently maintained, and their development overseen, by the [[TDWG|Taxonomic Databases Working Group]] (TDWG).

== Current activities ==

At the 2009 e-Biosphere conference in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-biosphere09.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the following themes were adopted, which is indicative of a broad range of current Biodiversity Informatics activities and how they might be categorized:

* Application: Conservation / Agriculture / Fisheries / Industry / Forestry
* Application: Invasive Alien Species
* Application: Systematic and Evolutionary Biology
* Application: Taxonomy and Identification Systems
* New Tools, Services and Standards for Data Management and Access
** New Modeling Tools
** New Tools for Data Integration
** New Approaches to Biodiversity Infrastructure
** New Approaches to Species Identification
** New Approaches to Mapping Biodiversity
* National and Regional Biodiversity Databases and Networks

A post-conference workshop of key persons with current significant Biodiversity Informatics roles also resulted in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20120226041400/http://www.e-biosphere09.org/assets/files/workshop/Resolution.pdf Workshop Resolution] that stressed, among other aspects, the need to create durable, global registries for the resources that are basic to biodiversity informatics (e.g., repositories, collections); complete the construction of a solid taxonomic infrastructure; and create ontologies for biodiversity data.

Chemically, '''black carbon''' ('''BC''') is a component of fine [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM ≤ 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in [[aerodynamic diameter]]). Black carbon consists of pure carbon in several linked forms.  It is formed through the incomplete combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[biofuel]], and [[biomass]], and is emitted in both [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and naturally occurring [[soot]].&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Anenberg SC, Schwartz J, Shindell D, Amann M, Faluvegi G, Klimont Z, Janssens-Maenhout G, Pozzoli L, Van Dingenen R, Vignati E, Emberson L, Muller NZ, West JJ, Williams M, Demkine V, Hicks WK, Kuylenstierna J, Raes F, Ramanathan V |title=Global air quality and health co-benefits of mitigating near-term climate change through methane and black carbon emission controls |journal=Environ Health Perspect |date=June 2012 |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=831–839 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104301|pmid=22418651| pmc=3385429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], black carbon is a [[climate forcing]] agent. Black carbon [[Global warming|warms the Earth]] by absorbing sunlight and heating the atmosphere and by reducing [[albedo]] when deposited on snow and ice (direct effects) and indirectly by interaction with clouds, with the total forcing of 1.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50171/abstract|title = Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment|last = Bond|date = 2013|journal = J.

==Overview==
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
The term black carbon was coined by [[Tihomir Novakov]], referred to as "the godfather of black carbon studies" by [[James Hansen]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Allan|title=Carbonaceous Aerosols and Climate Change: How Researchers Proved Black Carbon is a Significant Force in the Atmosphere|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/newsletter/nl17/eetd-nl17-4-blackcarbon.html|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke or soot was the first pollutant to be recognized as having significant [[environmental impact]] yet one of the last to be studied by the contemporary atmospheric research community.  [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] recognized that soot was composed of carbon and that it was produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, M., Chemical History of a Candle, Harper, New York, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Soot is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”. The term elemental carbon has been used in conjunction with thermal and wet chemical determinations and the term  graphitic carbon suggests the presence  of [[graphite]]-like micro-crystalline structures in soot as evidenced by [[Raman Spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | title = Raman scattering and the characterization of  atmospheric aerosol particles | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 266 | issue = 708–710| page = 1977 | doi=10.1038/266708a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.266..708R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yasa | first1 = Z. | last2 = Amer | first2 = N.M. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = H. | last4 = Hansen | first4 = A.D.A | last5 = Novakov | first5 = T. | year = 1979 | title = Photoacoustic investigations of urban aerosol particles | url = | journal = Appl.

===Early mitigation attempts===
The disastrous effects of coal pollution on human health and mortality in the early 1950s in London led to the UK [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. This act led to dramatic  reductions of soot concentrations in the United Kingdom which were followed by similar reductions in US cities like Pittsburgh and St. Louis. These reductions were largely achieved by the decreased use of soft coal for domestic heating by switching either to “smokeless” coals or other forms of fuel, such as fuel oil and natural gas.  The steady reduction of smoke pollution in the industrial cities of Europe and United States caused a shift in research emphasis away from soot emissions and the almost complete neglect of black carbon as a significant aerosol constituent, at least in the United States.

In the 1970s, however, a series of studies substantially changed this picture and demonstrated that black carbon as well as the organic soot components continued to be a large component in urban aerosols across the United States and Europe&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novakov | first1 = T. | last2 = Chang | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Harker | first3 = A.B. | year = 1974 | title = Sulfates as pollution particulates:Catalytic formationon carbon(soot) particles | url = | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = | pages = 259–261 | doi=10.1126/science.186.4160.259|bibcode = 1974Sci...186..259N | pmid=17782021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | year = 1975 | title = Formation of pollution particulate nitrogen compounds by NO-soot and NH3-soot gas particle surface reactions | url = | journal = Atmos.

In the less-developed regions of the world where there were limited or no controls on soot emissions the air quality continued to degrade as the population increased.  It was not generally realized until many years later that from the perspective of global effects the emissions from these regions were extremely important.

===Influence on Earth's atmosphere===
Most of the developments mentioned above relate to air quality in urban atmospheres. The first indications of the role of black carbon in a larger, global context came from studies of the Arctic Haze phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell. J.M., Visual Range in the polar regions with particular reference to the Alaskan Arctic, ''J. Almos. Terr. Phys.'', suppl., 195-211, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  Black carbon was identified in the Arctic haze aerosols&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | last3 = Bodhaine | first3 = B. | year = 1981 | title = Soot in the Arctic | url = | journal = Atmos.

In general, aerosol particles can affect the radiation balance leading to a cooling or heating effect with the magnitude and sign of the temperature change largely dependent on aerosol optical properties, aerosol concentrations, and the albedo of the underlying surface.  A purely scattering aerosol will reflect energy that would normally be absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system back to space and leads to a cooling effect. As one adds an absorbing component to the aerosol, it can lead to a heating of the earth-atmosphere system if the reflectivity of the underlying surface is sufficiently high.

Early studies of the effects of aerosols on atmospheric radiative transfer on a global scale assumed a dominantly scattering aerosol with only a small absorbing component, since this appears to be a good representation of naturally occurring aerosols. However, as discussed above, urban aerosols have a large black carbon component and if these particles can be transported on a global scale then one would expect a heating effect over surfaces with a high surface albedo like snow or ice.  Furthermore, if these particles are deposited in the snow an additional heating effect would occur due to reductions in the surface albedo.

===Measuring and modeling spatial distribution===
Levels of Black carbon are most often determined based on the modification of the optical properties of a fiber filter by deposited particles. Either filter transmittance, filter reflectance or a combination of transmittance and reflectance is measured. [[Aethalometers]] are frequently used devices that optically detect the changing absorption of light transmitted through a filter ticket. The USEPA Environmental Technology Verification program evaluated both the Aethalometer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EPA|first=|date=February 2014|title=ETV Joint Verification Statement|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100MH5J.PDF?Dockey=P100MH5J.PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Sunset Laboratory thermal-optical analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/html/vt-ams.html#bcm]&lt;/ref&gt; A multiangle absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light.  Alternative methods rely on satellite based measurements of optical depth for large areas or more recently on spectral noise analysis for very local concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dekoninck | first1 = L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = An instantaneous spatiotemporal model to predict a bicyclist's Black Carbon exposure based on mobile noise measurements | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume =  79| issue = | pages =  623–631| doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.054 | bibcode = 2013AtmEn..79..623D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s surprisingly large ground level concentrations of black carbon were observed throughout the western Arctic.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; Modeling studies indicated that they could lead to heating over polar ice. One of the major uncertainties in modeling the effects of the Arctic haze on the solar radiation balance was limited knowledge of the vertical distributions of black carbon.

During 1983 and 1984 as part of the [[NOAA]] AGASP program, the first measurements of such distributions in the Arctic atmosphere were obtained with an [[aethalometer]] which had the capability of measuring black carbon on a real-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = A.D.A. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = H. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = The Aethalometer: an instrument for real-time measurement of optical absorption by aerosol particles | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 191–196 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90265-1| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..191H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These measurements showed substantial concentrations of black carbon found throughout the western Arctic troposphere including the North Pole.  The vertical profiles showed either a strongly layered structure or an almost uniform distribution up to eight kilometers with concentrations within layers as large as those found at ground level in typical mid-latitude urban areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=Rosen2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = A.D.A. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = Role of graphitic carbon particles in radiative transfer in the Arctic haze | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90253-5| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absorption [[optical depth]]s associated with these vertical profiles were large as evidenced by a vertical profile over the Norwegian arctic where absorption optical depths of 0.023 to 0.052 were calculated respectively for external and internal mixtures of black carbon with the other aerosol components.&lt;ref name=Rosen2/&gt;

Optical depths of these magnitudes lead to a substantial change in the solar radiation balance over the highly reflecting Arctic snow surface during the March–April time frame of these measurements modeled the Arctic aerosol for an absorption optical depth of 0.021 (which is close to the average of an internal and external mixtures for the AGASP flights), under cloud-free conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porch | first1 = W.M. | last2 = McCracken | first2 = M.C. | year = 1982 | title = Parametric study of the effects of arctic soot on solar radiation | url = | journal = Atmos.

===Presence in soils===
Up to 30% of the total carbon stored in soils is contributed by black carbon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Especially for tropical soils black carbon serves as a reservoir for nutrients. Experiments showed that soils without high amounts of black carbon are significantly less fertile than soils that contain black carbon. An example for this increased soil fertility are the [[Terra preta]] soils of central Amazonia, which are presumably human-made by pre-Columbian native populations. Terra Preta soils have on average three times higher soil organic matter (SOM) content, higher nutrient levels and a better nutrient retention capacity than surrounding infertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = B. | last2 = Haumaier | first2 = L. | last3 = Guggenberger | first3 = G. | last4 = Zech | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The 'Terra preta' phenomenon: a model for sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 37–41 | doi=10.1007/s001140000193|bibcode = 2001NW.....88...37G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the [[slash and burn]] agricultural practice used in tropical regions does not only enhance productivity by releasing nutrients from the burned vegetation but also by adding black carbon to the soil. Nonetheless, for a sustainable management, a [[slash-and-char]] practice would be better in order to prevent high emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and volatile black carbon. Furthermore, the positive effects of this type of agriculture are counteracted if used for large patches so that soil erosion is not prevented by the vegetation.

==Emission sources==

===By region===
Developed countries were once the primary source of black carbon emissions, but this began to change in the 1950s with the adoption of pollution control technologies in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 ("Until about the 1950s, North America and Western Europe were the major sources of soot emissions, but now developing nations in the tropics and East Asia are the major source problem.").&lt;/ref&gt;   Whereas the United States emits about 21% of the world’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it emits 6.1% of the world’s soot.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union and United States might further reduce their black carbon emissions by accelerating implementation of black carbon regulations that currently take effect in 2015 or 2020&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, 72 Fed. Reg. 20586, 20587 (April 25, 2007) (to be codified as 40 C.F.R. pt. 51), ''available at''http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2007/April/Day-25/a6347.pdf; Press Release, European Union, Environment: Commission welcomes final adoption of the air quality directive, (April 14, 2008), ''available at'' http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/570&amp;type = HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en.&lt;/ref&gt; and by supporting the adoption of pending International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization, Press Release, IMO Environment meeting Approves Revised Regulations on Ship Emissions, International Maritime Organization (4 April 2008),'' available at''http://www.imo.org/About/mainframe.asp?topic_id=1709&amp;doc_id=9123(The IMO has approved amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships which are now subject to adoption at an October 2008  meeting.).&lt;/ref&gt; Existing regulations also could be expanded to increase the use of clean diesel and [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] and to develop second-generation technologies.

Today, the majority of black carbon emissions are from developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 2-3 (October 18, 2007), ''available at''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110647.pdf [hereinafter Bond Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; and this trend is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="Reference Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sources of black carbon are Asia, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, ''Summary: Aerosols'', Air Pollution as a Climate Forcing: A Workshop, Honolulu, Hawaii, April 29-May 3, 2002, ''available at'' http://www.giss.nasa.gov/meetings/pollution2002/&lt;/ref&gt;  China and India together account for 25-35% of global black carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael,'' supra'' note 1, at 226&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon emissions from China doubled from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan" /&gt;  Existing and well-tested technologies used by developed countries, such as clean diesel and clean coal, could be transferred to developing countries to reduce their emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony,'' supra'' note 4, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon emissions are highest in and around major source regions. This results in regional hotspots of atmospheric solar heating due to black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotspot areas include:&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
* eastern China 
* most of Southeast Asia and Indonesia 
* equatorial regions of Africa 
* Mexico and Central America 
* most of Brazil and Peru in South America.

Approximately three billion people live in these hotspots.&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"/&gt;

===By source===
[[File:Tahmand alumiiniumpott.JPG|thumb|Black carbon on a cooking pot. Result of a biofuel cooking.]]
Approximately 20% of black carbon is emitted from burning biofuels, 40% from fossil fuels, and 40% from open biomass burning.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.'' at 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar estimates of the sources of black carbon emissions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See Bond Testimony, ''supra'' note 42, at 2 (figure 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

*42%    Open biomass burning (forest and savanna burning)
*18%	Residential biofuel burned with traditional technologies
*14%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for transportation
*10%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for industrial use
*10% 	Industrial processes and power generation, usually from smaller boilers
*6%	Residential [[coal]] burned with traditional technologies&lt;ref&gt;Bond Testimony,'' id.'' at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon sources vary by region.  For example, the majority of soot emissions in South Asia are due to biofuel cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venkataraman | first1 = C. | last2 = Habib | first2 = G. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Residential Biofuels in South Asia: Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions and Climate Impacts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5714| pages = 1454–1456 | doi=10.1126/science.1104359|bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1454V | pmid=15746423}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in East Asia, coal combustion for residential and industrial uses plays a larger role. In Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.&lt;ref name="Dons et al."&gt;{{cite journal

Fossil fuel and biofuel soot have significantly greater amounts of black carbon than climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter, making reductions of these sources particularly powerful mitigation strategies. For example, emissions from the diesel engines and marine vessels contain higher levels of black carbon compared to other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 5-6 (showing that shipping emissions produce more than 3 times as much black carbon as POC, while off-road vehicles produce 40% more black carbon than POC, and on-road vehicles produce 25-60% more black carbon than POC).&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulating black carbon emissions from diesel engines and marine vessels therefore presents a significant opportunity to reduce black carbon’s global warming impact.&lt;ref&gt;Although shipping only accounts for 1.7% of the global black carbon inventory, given the expected increase in shipping throughout regions especially sensitive to black carbon like the Arctic, it still represents a strong option for black carbon reductions.  Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping, 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass burning emits greater amounts of climate-cooling [[aerosol]]s and particulate matter than black carbon, resulting in short-term cooling.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', ''supra'' note 27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over the long-term, biomass burning may cause a net warming when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and deforestation are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark. Z. Jacobson, ''The Short-Term Cooling but Long-Term Global Warming Due to Biomass Burning'', 17 ''Journal of Climate'' 2909, 2923 (". . . whereas aerosol particles emitted during burning may cause a short-term cooling of global climate, longer-lived greenhouse gases may cause warming (or cancel the cooling) after several decades.

==Impacts==
Black carbon is a form of ultrafine [[particulate matter]], which when released in the air causes premature human mortality and disability.  In addition, atmospheric black carbon changes the radiative energy balance of the climate system in a way that raises air and surface temperatures, causing a variety of detrimental environmental impacts on humans, on agriculture, and on plant and animal ecosystems.

===Public health impacts===
Particulate matter is the most harmful to public health of all air pollutants in Europe. Black carbon particulate matter contains very fine [[carcinogen]]s and is therefore particularly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/black-carbon-better-monitoring-needed|title=Black carbon: Better monitoring needed to assess health and climate change impacts|website=European Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that from 640,000 to 4,900,000 premature human deaths could be prevented every year by utilizing available mitigation measures to reduce black carbon in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinhold|first=Bob|title=Global Bang for the Buck: Cutting Black Carbon and Methane Benefits Both Health and Climate|journal=Environ.

Humans are exposed to black carbon by inhalation of air in the immediate vicinity of local sources. Important indoor sources include candles and biomass burning whereas traffic and occasionally forest fires are the major outdoor sources of black carbon exposure. Concentrations of black carbon decrease sharply with increasing distance from (traffic) sources which makes it an atypical component of [[particulate matter]]. This makes it difficult to estimate exposure of populations. For particulate matter epidemiological studies have traditionally relied on single fixed site measurements or inferred residential concentrations.&lt;ref name="Dons et al. 2013 hourly"&gt;{{cite journal

The public health benefits of reduction in the amount of soot and other particulate matter has been recognized for years. However, high concentrations persist in industrializing areas in Asia and in urban areas in the West such as [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Lydersen|first=Kari|title=Black Carbon Testing Finds High Levels| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22cnccarbon.html|accessdate=April 22, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2011|quote=Major American cities generally have background levels of one to three micrograms of black carbon per cubic meter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that air pollution causes nearly two million premature deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/index.html|title=Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing black carbon, a primary component of fine particulate matter, the health risks from air pollution will decline.  In fact, public health concerns have given rise to leading to many efforts to reduce such emissions, for example, from diesel vehicles and cooking stoves.

===Climate impacts===
'''Direct effect''' Black carbon particles directly absorb sunlight and reduce the planetary albedo when suspended in the atmosphere.

'''Semi-direct effect''' Black carbon absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. They may either increase or decrease cloud cover under different conditions.&lt;ref name="Koch and Del Genio, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=D.|author2=A.D.Del Genio|title=Black carbon semi-direct effects on cloud cover: review and synthesis|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|date=2010|volume=10|pages=7685–7696|doi=10.5194/acp-10-7685-2010|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/7685/2010/acp-10-7685-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow/ice albedo effect''' When deposited on high albedo surfaces like ice and snow, black carbon particles reduce the total surface albedo available to reflect solar energy back into space. Small initial snow albedo reduction may have a large forcing because of a positive feedback: Reduced snow albedo would increase surface temperature. The increased surface temperature would decrease the snow cover and further decrease surface albedo.&lt;ref name=JGR032612&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. C. Bond|author2=S. J. Doherty |author3=D. W.

'''Indirect effect''' Black carbon may also indirectly cause changes in the absorption or reflection of solar radiation through changes in the properties and behavior of clouds. Research scheduled for publication in 2013 shows black carbon plays a role second only to carbon dioxide in climate change. Effects are complex, resulting from a variety of factors, but due to the short life of black carbon in the atmosphere, about a week as compared to carbon dioxide which last centuries, control of black carbon offers possible opportunities for slowing, or even reversing, climate change.&lt;ref name=JGR032612/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|author2=S.

====Radiative forcing====
Estimates of black carbon’s globally averaged direct radiative forcing vary from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]’s estimate of + 0.34 watts per square meter (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ± 0.25,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 132 (2007), available at http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm. (Magnitudes and uncertainties added together, as per standard uncertainty rules)&lt;/ref&gt;  to a more recent estimate by V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael of 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a"&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 NATURE GEOSCIENCE  221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC also estimated the globally averaged snow albedo effect of black carbon at +0.1 ± 0.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Based on the IPCC estimate, it would be reasonable to conclude that the combined direct and indirect snow albedo effects for black carbon rank it as the third largest contributor to globally averaged positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial period. In comparison, the more recent direct radiative forcing estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael &lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a" /&gt; would lead one to conclude that black carbon has contributed the second largest globally averaged radiative forcing after carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and that the radiative forcing of black carbon is “as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, or tropospheric ozone.”

====Effects on Arctic ice and Himalayan glaciers====
According to the {{abbr|IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}, “the presence of black carbon over highly reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice, or clouds, may cause a significant positive radiative forcing.”&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397. ("While the radiative forcing is generally negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with a very high surface reflectance such as desert regions in North Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas."); J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 14, at 425. (The brown haze over India, heavy with fossil fuel and biofuel soot, reaches to the Himalayas. If prevailing winds deposit even a fraction of this soot on glaciers, the snow black carbon content could be comparable to that in the Alps.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC also notes that emissions from [[biomass]] burning, which usually have a negative forcing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen, et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', 110 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D18104, 1 (2005), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022162835/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-22 |df= }} (Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as black carbon + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning black carbon + OC has a negative forcing).&lt;/ref&gt;  have a positive forcing over snow fields in areas such as the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Zender, black carbon is a significant contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be “the most efficient way to mitigate Arctic warming that we know of”.&lt;ref&gt;Zender Testimony, ''supra''note 3, at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The “climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 425.&lt;/ref&gt;  The “soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''id.'' at 428&lt;/ref&gt; “Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,” according to [[NASA]] scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''id.'' at 425&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this feedback process, “BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.”&lt;ref&gt;See ''supra'' note 18&lt;/ref&gt;  When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to [[Arctic Haze]], surface temperatures increase by 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;P.K.

Black carbon emissions from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia have the greatest absolute impact on Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn,''supra'' note 34, at 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; However, black carbon emissions actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic warming than emissions originating elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt; As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id.'' at 1732; J. Hansen &amp; M.

Thus, in that case, reduction of some of the pollutants [including soot] may make it possible to keep further Arctic warming very small and thus probably avoid loss of all sea ice.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
In its 2007 report, the IPCC estimated for the first time the direct [[radiative forcing]] of black carbon from fossil fuel emissions at +&amp;nbsp;0.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², and the radiative forcing of black carbon through its effect on the surface albedo of snow and ice at an additional +&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 136, 163 (2007), ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies and public testimony by many of the same scientists cited in the IPCC’s report estimate that emissions from black carbon are the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide emissions, and that reducing these emissions may be the fastest strategy for slowing climate change.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See id''. at 164, 170, 174–76, 217–34 (citing studies by Ramanathan, Jacobson, Zender, Hansen, and Bond); ''supra'' notes 3-4 (Zender Testimony and Ramanathan Testimony); ''infra'' notes 9 and 42 (Jacobson Testimony and Bond Testimony).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, many countries have significantly reduced black carbon emissions, especially from fossil fuel sources, primarily to improve public health from improved air quality, and “technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related BC” throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 4 (18 October 2007), ''available at ''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110734.pdf [hereinafter Ramanathan Testimony] (The developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more. Thus the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon); ''but compare'' Bond, T. C., E. Bhardwaj, R. Dong, R. Jogani, S. Jung, C. Roden, D. G. Streets, and N. M. 'Trautmann Historical emissions of black and organic carbon aerosol from energy-related combustion, 1850–2000'', 21 Global Biogeochemical Cycles GB2018 (2007) (Previous work suggests a rapid rise in [global] black carbon emissions between 1950 and 2000; this work supports a more gradual, smooth increase between 1950 and 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Given black carbon’s relatively short lifespan, reducing black carbon emissions would reduce warming within weeks. Because black carbon remains in the atmosphere only for a few weeks, reducing black carbon emissions may be the fastest means of slowing climate change in the near term.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/science/earth/16degrees.html "Third-World Stove Soot Is Target in Climate Fight"] article by Elizabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Control of black carbon, particularly from fossil-fuel and biofuel sources, is very likely to be the fastest method of slowing global warming in the immediate future,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mark Z.

OF THE NAT’L ACAD. OF SCI. 6 (12 February 2008) ("The greatest threats are tipping the Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet. . ."); J. Hansen, ''Climate Catastrophe'', NEW SCIENTIST (28 July 2007) (...the primary issue is whether global warming will reach a level such that ice sheets begin to disintegrate in a rapid, non-linear fashion on West Antarctica, Greenland or both.").&lt;/ref&gt;

“Emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions”.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 (". . . emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions.") Numerous scientists also calculate that black carbon may be second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its contribution to climate change, including Tami C. Bond &amp; Haolin Sun, ''Can Reducing Black Carbon Emissions Counteract Global Warming'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHN. (2005), at 5921 ("BC is the second or third largest individual warming agent, following carbon dioxide and methane."); ''and'' J. Hansen, ''A Brighter Future'', 53 CLIMATE CHANGE 435 (2002), ''available at'' http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2002/2002_Hansen_1.pdf (calculating the climate forcing of BC at 1.0±0.5 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation of black carbon’s combined climate forcing at 1.0–1.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², which “is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other [GHGs] such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists estimate the total magnitude of black carbon’s forcing between + 0.2 and 1.1&amp;nbsp;W/m² with varying ranges due to uncertainties. (See Table 1.) This compares with the IPCC’s climate forcing estimates of 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.48&amp;nbsp;W/m² for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. (See Table 2.)&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, "Technical Summary", in ''Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science basis,''. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 21 (2007) ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, black carbon forcing is two to three times as effective in raising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic than equivalent forcing values of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) ("The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. ("The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3."); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) ("The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the "efficacy" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson calculates that reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot particles would eliminate about 40% of the net observed global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Gross global warming should result in about 2&amp;nbsp;°C (4&amp;nbsp;°F) temperature rise. However, observed global warming is only about 0.8 °C because cooling particles off set much of the warming. Reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot would reduce about 40% of the observed warming and about 16% of the gross warming.  Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 3. ("The figure also shows that fossil-fuel plus biofuel soot may contribute to about 16% of gross global warming (warming due to all greenhouse gases plus soot plus the heat island effect), but its control in isolation could reduce 40% of net global warming.").&lt;/ref&gt;  (See Figure 1.) In addition to black carbon, fossil fuel and biofuel soot contain aerosols and particulate matter that cool the planet by reflecting the sun’s radiation away from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.'' at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the aerosols and particulate matter are accounted for, fossil fuel and biofuel soot are increasing temperatures by about 0.35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon alone is estimated to have a 20-year [[Global Warming Potential]] (GWP) of 4,470, and a 100-year GWP of 1,055–2,240.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.''  As an aerosol, there is not standardized formula for developing global warming potentials (GWP) for black carbon.

The Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization calculates that cutting black carbon, along with tropospheric ozone and its precursor, methane, can reduce the rate of global warming by half and the rate of warming in the Arctic by two-thirds, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. By trimming “peak warming”, such cuts can keep current global temperature rise below 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C for 30 years and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C for 60 years, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. (FN: UNEP-WMO 2011.)

The reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as SLCFs could keep global temperature rise under 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2030, and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2070, assuming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also cut.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; See the graph on page 12 of the [http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/Black_Carbon.pdf UNEP-WMO report].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Control technologies==
Ramanathan notes that “developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more since 1950.  Thus, the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon.” &lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony, ''supra'' note 4, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson believes that “[g]iven proper conditions and incentives, [soot] polluting technologies can be quickly phased out.  In some small-scale applications (such as domestic cooking in developing countries), health and convenience will drive such a transition when affordable, reliable alternatives are available.  For other sources, such as vehicles or coal boilers, regulatory approaches may be required to nudge either the transition to existing technology or the development of new technology.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Hansen states that “technology is within reach that could greatly reduce soot, restoring snow albedo to near pristine values, while having multiple other benefits for climate, human health, agricultural productivity, and environmental aesthetics.  Already soot emissions from coal are decreasing in many regions with transition from small users to power plants with scrubbers.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 428&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson suggests converting “[U.S.] vehicles from fossil fuel to electric, plug-in-hybrid, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where the electricity or hydrogen is produced by a renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal power.  Such a conversion would eliminate 160 Gg/yr (24%) of U.S. (or 1.5% of world) fossil-fuel soot and about 26% of U.S. (or 5.5% of world) carbon dioxide.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobson’s estimates, this proposal would reduce soot and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1.63 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–eq. per year.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson offers an estimate of total U.S. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2005 of 6270 metric tonnes, 26% of which is 1630.'' Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, “that the elimination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would also eliminate some cooling particles, reducing the net benefit by at most, half, but improving human health,” a substantial reduction for one policy in one country.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9&lt;/ref&gt;

For diesel vehicles in particular there are several effective technologies available.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA), "Emission Control Technologies for Diesel-Powered Vehicles," 9  (December 2007) ("Diesel oxidation catalysts installed on a vehicle’s exhaust system can reduce total PM typically by as much as 25 to over 50 percent by mass, under some conditions depending on the composition of the PM being emitted"), available at:http://www.meca.org/galleries/default-file/MECA%20Diesel%20White%20Paper%2012-07-07%20final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer, more efficient [[diesel particulate filter]]s (DPFs), or traps, can eliminate over 90% of black carbon emissions,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', ("DPFs can achieve up to, and in some cases, greater than a 90 percent reduction in PM. High efficiency filters are extremely effective in controlling the carbon fraction of the particulate, the portion of the particulate that some health experts believe may be the PM component of greatest concern").&lt;/ref&gt; but these devices require [[ultra-low sulfur diesel]] fuel (ULSD).  To ensure compliance with new particulate rules for new on-road and non-road vehicles in the U.S., the EPA first required a nationwide shift to ULSD, which allowed DPFs to be used in diesel vehicles in order to meet the standards.  Because of recent EPA regulations, black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles are expected to decline about 70 percent from 2001 to 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at 5, ("Mobile source black carbon emissions are estimated at 234 Gg in 2001, representing 54 percent of the nationwide black carbon emissions of 436 Gg.  Under Scenario F, mobile source emissions are projected to decline to 71 Gg, a reduction of 163 Gg."&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, “BC emissions in the United States are projected to decline by 42 percent from 2001 to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bahner, Mark A., Weitz, Keith A., Zapata, Alexandra and DeAngelo, Benjamin, Use of Black Carbon and Organic Carbon Inventories for Projections and Mitigation Analysis," 1, (2007) available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/conference/ei16/session3/k.weitz.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the full fleet is subject to these rules, EPA estimates that over 239,000 tons of particulate matter will be reduced annually.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Heavy-Duty Highway Diesel Program, available at: http://www.epa.gov/oms/highway-diesel/index.htm ("Once this action is fully implemented…Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year"); EPA, Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule—Facts and Figures, available at: http://www.epa.gov/nonroad-diesel/2004fr/420f04037.htm ("Environmental Benefits When the Fleet of Older Nonroad Engines Has Fully Turned Over by 2030: Annual reductions of Fine PM (PM2.5): 129,000 tons").&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the US diesel oxidation catalysts are often available and DPFs will become available as ULSD is more widely commercialized.

Another technology for reducing black carbon emissions from diesel engines is to shift fuels to compressed natural gas. In [[New Delhi]], India, the [[supreme court]] ordered shift to compressed natural gas for all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis, and rickshaws, resulted in a climate benefit, “largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines.”&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("When aerosol emissions are included, the switch to CNG fueling results in a climate benefit, largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines"). The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court.  ''See'' Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking'', Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the fuel switch for the vehicles reduced black carbon emissions enough to produce a 10 percent net reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq., and perhaps as much as 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("However, when aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e)").&lt;/ref&gt; The main gains were from diesel bus engines whose CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. emissions were reduced 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at Section 3.1 ("In total there is about a 10% reduction of net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions, and if buses are considered separately, net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions are reduced by about 20%").&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study examining these emissions reductions, “there is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.”&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', 1, ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies are also in development to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, ''Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping'', 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and particulate filters similar to those in use for land vehicles are now being tested on them.  As with current particulate filters these too would require the ships to use ULSD, but if comparable emissions reductions are attainable, up to 120,000 metric tons of particulate emissions could be eliminated each year from international shipping. That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts can reduce the amount of black carbon emissions from ships simply by decreasing the amount of fuel the ships use.  By traveling at slower speeds or by using shore side electricity when at port instead of running the ship’s diesel engines for electric power, ships can save fuel and reduce emissions.

Reynolds and Kandlikar estimate that the shift to [[compressed natural gas]] for public transport in New Delhi ordered by the Supreme Court reduced climate emissions by 10 to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("Between 2001 and 2003, public transport vehicles in New Delhi were required to switch their fuel to natural gas in an attempt to reduce their air pollution impacts. …[W]hen [black carbon and other] aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eq), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction…. There is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.") The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court. See Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking,'' Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanathan estimates that “providing alternative energy-efficient and smoke-free cookers and introducing transferring technology for reducing soot emissions from coal combustion in small industries could have major impacts on the radiative forcing due to soot.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the impact of replacing biofuel cooking with black carbon-free cookers (solar, bio, and natural gas) in South and East Asia is dramatic: over South Asia, a 70 to 80% reduction in black carbon heating; and in East Asia, a 20 to 40% reduction.”&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation ==

Condensed aromatic ring structures indicate black carbon degradation in soil. [[Saprophytic fungi]] are being researched for their potential role in the degradation of black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct molecular evidence for the degradation and mobility of black carbon in soils from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter from a fire-impacted forest|journal=Organic Chemistry soil|year=2006|author1=Hockaday WC|author2=Grannas AM|author3=Kim S,|author4=Hatcher PG|volume=37|issue=4|pages=501–510|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy options==
Many countries have existing national laws to regulate black carbon emissions, including laws that address particulate emissions.  Some examples include:

*banning or regulating slash-and-burn clearing of forests and savannas;
*requiring shore-based power/electrification of ships at port, regulating idling at terminals, and mandating fuel standards for ships seeking to dock at port;
*requiring regular vehicle emissions tests, retirement, or retrofitting (e.g. adding particulate traps&lt;ref&gt;O. Boucher and M.S. Reddy, ''Climate trade-off between black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions'', 36 [[Energy Policy (journal)|ENERGY POLICY]] 193, 196-198 (2007) (Particulate traps on diesel engines reduce black carbon emissions and associated climate forcing but are partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Where the fuel penalty is 2-3%, black carbon reductions will produce positive benefits for the climate for the first 28-68 years, assuming reduction in black carbon emission is 0.150.30 g/mile, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are 15002000 g/mile, and a 100-year GWP of 680 is used for black carbon. The net positive benefits for climate will continue for up to centuries in northern regions because of black carbon's effect on snow and ice albedo).&lt;/ref&gt;), including penalties for failing to meet air quality emissions standards, and heightened penalties for on-the-road "super-emitting" vehicles;
*banning or regulating the sale of certain fuels and/or requiring the use of cleaner fuels for certain uses;
*limiting the use of chimneys and other forms of biomass burning in urban and non-urban areas;
*requiring permits to operate industrial, power generating, and oil refining facilities and periodic permit renewal and/or modification of equipment; and
*requiring filtering technology and high-temperature combustion (e.g. [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] coal) for existing power generation plants, and regulating annual emissions from power generation plants.

The International Network for Environmental Compliance &amp; Enforcement issued a Climate Compliance Alert on Black Carbon in 2008 which cited reduction of [[carbon black]] as a cost-effective way to reduce a major cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inece.org/climate/INECEClimateComplianceAlert_BlackCarbon.pdf "Jump-Starting Climate Protection: INECE Targets Compliance with Laws Controlling Black Carbon"] analysis by [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]], June 12, 2008, accessed April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
He served on the faculty of [[University of British Columbia]], where he taught linguistics and cognitive science,&lt;ref name="catdir.loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publisher-supplied biographical information about contributor(s) for Biological exuberance : animal homosexuality and natural diversity / Bruce Bagemihl ; illustrated by John Megahan|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/bios/hol054/98028528.html|website=catdir.loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from there in 1988.

''Biological Exuberance'' cites numerous studies on more than 450 species (see [[List of animals displaying homosexual behavior]]) showing that [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]] behaviors are common among animals and proposes a theory of sexual behavior in which [[reproduction]] is only one of its principal biological functions.&lt;ref name = Harrold1999&gt;{{cite news|last = Harrold|first = Max|date = February 16, 1999|title = Creature Comforts|newspaper = [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|accessdate = March 10, 2018|pages = 61–62|issue = 779|publisher = [[Here Publishing]]|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61|quote = In his news book, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity'' ... author Bruce Bagemihl portrays an animal kingdom that embraces a whole spectrum of sexual orientations ...

'''Comprehensive planning''' is a process that determines community goals and aspirations in terms of community development. The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by [[urban planners]] in the United States.

In Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an [[Official Community Plan]] or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.

During the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the [[American Revolution]], the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city.

Cities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the [[Sanitary Reform Movement]]. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The [[City Beautiful movement]] was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the [[World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities.

In 1898, [[Ebenezer Howard]] published his book entitled "Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform," in which he developed the idea of a [[garden city movement|Garden City]]. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a [[green belt]] and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]], England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth.

After the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]] who re-created the city plan for [[Washington, D.C.]] created by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. However, over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and in 1906 he created the city plan for [[San Francisco, California]]. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. [[Burnham Plan|The plan of Chicago]] is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.

== Comprehensive planning process ==
Comprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs.

===Identifying issues===
The planner must first address the issue they are investigating. "To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Larz. (1995) ''Guidelines for Preparing Urban Plans'' Chicago: APA Planners Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens.

===Stating goals===
Once issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community.

===Collecting data===
Data is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the [[United States Census Bureau]], however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs.

===Preparing the plan===
The plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format.
&lt;ref&gt;↔&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating implementation plans===
During this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives.

===Evaluating alternatives===
Each alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals.

===Adopting a plan===
The community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The [[City Council]] may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development.

===Implementing and monitoring the plan===
Using the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired.

A comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.

== Legal basis ==
The basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.  The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] which was written by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the [[United States Congress]] but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used.

In states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily.

However, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding.  A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24132">The '''conservation and restoration of [[ivory]] objects''' is activities dedicated to the preservation and projection of ivory object that have a value either historically or personally. Within institutions of cultural heritage this role is ideally taken on by the conservator.

Ivory is relatively soft and can be worked on with nonmetal tools so it is often carved in decorative object, practical objects, and can be inlaid in other pieces. A popular decorative ivory work is [[scrimshaw]], which is etched ivory with black or colored pigments. Ivory objects have been around since [[prehistoric]] times. Its [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] is concerned particularly with the environmental causes of deterioration

==Ivory==

Ivory is the tusks and unusually large or projected teeth of animals, such as [[elephants]] and [[walruses]]. It consists of dentin and made up of both organic (for growth and repair) and inorganic (rigidity and strength) components. Due to it being organic and inorganic the ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive &lt;ref name="Craft"&gt;{{cite book |last = Craft | first = Meg |editor = Harriet Whelchel |title = Caring for your collections | year = 1992 |publisher= Harry N. Abrams, Incorporated |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-2558-3 |pages=96–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of ivory===

Understanding the diverse types of ivory is important as it can impact the type of conservation and restoration work that is done. It can also determine the materials that are harmful or safe to use on the ivory.

====Elephant and mammoth====

Elephant and [[mammoth]] ivory comes from the two modified upper incisors. Tusks of some male African elephants can grow up to 2 meters (6 ½ feet) and weigh up to 45 kilograms (100 pounds). The tusks have a pulp cavity where the root and soft tissues attach to the jaw and that extends for approximately one-third of the tusk. By looking at if the carved ivory does or does not have the pulp cavity it can help indicate what part of the tusk was used and its original length.&lt;ref name= "Hornbeck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hornbeck |first=Stephanie |year=2014  |title=Ivory: identification and regulation of a precious material  |journal= National Museum of African Art Conservation Lab  |pages=1–10  |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of African Art |url=http://anyflip.com/zvle/rhnl/basic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic identifier in elephant ivory is the pattern of intersecting arcs that can be seen in the cross-section. These arcs can go by several names such as engine turnings, cross-hatchings, or Schreger lines (named after the German anatomist who first described them in 1800). The intersections of the lines form angles, obtuse arc angles are found in elephant ivory and acute arc angles are found in mammoth ivory.&lt;ref name= "Hornbeck"/&gt;

====Walrus====

Walrus ivory is solid its entire length with a center of secondary dentin instead of a pulp cavity. It is characterized in cross section by the central core that has a marbled appearance surrounded by the smooth creamy white dentin layer. They may grow up to 1.0 meter (3 ¼ feet) in length.&lt;ref name="CHIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216 |title= Care of ivory, bone, horn, and antler - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 6/1 |author=Tom Stone |date=2014 |publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warthog====

[[Warthog]] ivory comes from their upper and lower canine teeth and are strongly curved. It generally has squared cross sections and have a mottled appearance. When using a magnifying hand lens, the wart hog dentin shows irregularly spaced concentric lines with varying thickness.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fws.gov/lab/ivory_guide.php |title=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services Forensics Laboratory |author= U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Lab |date=2010 |publisher= U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Narwhal====

[[Narwhal]] ivory comes from a single left incisor that is produced by males. It is distinguished by its spiral form. They can grow from 2.0-7.0 meters (6 ½-23 feet) in length.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====Hippopotamus====

The upper and lower canine and incisors are the most common sources for [[hippopotamus]] ivory and each one has a distinctive gross morphology. Using a magnifying hand lens, we can see tightly packed series of fine concentric lines, which can be regularly or irregularly spaced. The orientation of these lines will follow with the overall shape of the tooth. Hippo ivory is harder and opaquer than elephant or walrus ivory.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

The upper canines are curved and are oval to rounded in the cross-section. The lower canines are the largest teeth and strongly curved. In their cross-section, they are triangular. The incisors can be described as peg shaped and the center of the tooth in the cross-section shows a small dot.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====Sperm whale and Killer whale====

Both the [[Sperm whale]] and [[Killer whale]] have conically shaped teeth with a small amount of enamel at the tips and the rest of the tooth covered by cementum. The cross-sections of the teeth are rounded or oval. A characteristic feature is that the dentin forms in layers that alternate directions giving it a banded appearance. Their teeth are second in hardness to hippopotamus ivory. Sperm whale teeth may grow up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (8 inches) in length while the killer whale teeth are slightly smaller. Killer whale teeth show two slight peripheral indentations and may also display a faint rosette pattern in the dentin cross-section.&lt;ref name="Ivory Identification" /&gt;

====French ivory====

[[French ivory]] is a synthetic material that is typically composed of pigmented cellulose nitrate and/or casein. This type of ivory was commonly made in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It looks like elephant ivory and can have intersecting line patterns but the pattern is more uniform and regular than natural ivory. This ivory will be occasionally marked synthetic while “French Ivory” or “India Ivory” are common marks. It can be distinguished from natural ivory due to its lighter weight and more even coloring.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

Cellulose nitrate can be identified with a chemical spot test using diphenylamine. This ivory can degrade and produce acidic and oxidizing nitrogen. Oxide gases have been known to spontaneously combust so if this type of ivory shows any deterioration it must be kept away from the rest of the collection.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

====Vegetable ivory (ivory nuts)====

[[Vegetable ivory]] is derived from several dense palm nuts that are native to Africa, South America, and the South Pacific. It is a cellulosic material. They grow to a maximum of 5&amp;nbsp;cm (approximately 2 inches) in diameter.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Composite mixtures====

Can be various mixtures including ivory dust and casein, ivory dust and styrene resin, calcium carbonate and adhesive, casein and hardener.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Plastic====

A proprietary [[plastic]] of cellulose nitrate and camphor that was developed in the mid-19th century as an ivory substitute. Other examples include polyester and phenolic resins. The plastics are sometimes laminated to show a striated surface to resembles ivory but ivory’s intersecting arc pattern cannot be reproduced.
&lt;ref name= "Ivory Identification" /&gt;

===Identifying ivory and previous treatments===

====Visual examination====

Visual examination is a very useful method to identify ivory. By using the characteristics of the variety of ivories listed about in addition to images and samples often they type of ivory can be identified. It is helpful to consider the size of the object, if it is a long and uninterrupted section it is may be elephant or mammoth. The weight is another indicator as ivory and bone are heavier than shell, horn, plastics, and composite mixtures.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

====Ultraviolet examination====

By using [[ultraviolet light]], it will help determine if the material is ivory or made from another material in a non-destructive way. The long wave ultraviolet light will fluoresce assorted colors or absorb the light which will help characterize the material. Ivory will fluoresce a bluish-white color as does bone and shell. Vegetable ivory will fluoresce a slightly orange color and the plastic ivory will absorb the light making it appear dull blue or matte.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Ivory |title= AIC Wiki Ivory |author1=Vanessa Muros |author2=Yuri Yanchyshyn |author3= Randy S. Wilkinson |author4= Jean Portell |author5= Stephanie Hornbeck |date= 2011 |publisher= Object Specialty Group Conservation Wiki }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light can also be used to see previous conservation materials and work done on the ivory along with possible pigmentation.&lt;ref name="Passmore"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Passmore |first1= Emma |last2= Ambers |first2= Janet |year=2012 |title= Hidden, looted, saved: the scientific research and conservation of a group of Bergram Ivories from the National Museum of Afghanistan |journal= Technical Research Bulletin |volume=6 |pages=33–46 |publisher= The British Museum |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/BMTRB_6_Passmore-et-al.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy====

“[[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]] (FTIR) is an analytical method that characterizes organic material based on the energy emitted by the bonds of specific chemical compounds comprising the composition of a sample when submitted to infrared radiation.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;”

FTIR can differentiate ivory from other materials, except bone, as they have a similar chemical composition. It can also help identify the chemical composition of any pigments used on the ivory along with the previous mixtures and materials used for conservation or restoration of the object.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

====X-Radiography====

[[X-ray]] can be used to look at the type of ivory it could be, if there are two separate pieces of ivory attached to each other, if there are nails/screws holding them together either from its original creators or for restoration work.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

====DNA analysis====

[[DNA analysis]] is a more precise method of identification as it can identify if it is an African or Asian elephant and even specific areas from within a country that the ivory may belong to. This method requires a small sample of ivory where the mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA can be isolated and compared.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

==Deterioration==
Ivory is [[hygroscopic]] and [[anisotropic]], tending to shrink, swell, crack, split, and/or warp on exposure to extremes or fluctuations in [[relative humidity]] and [[temperature]], It is subject to [[light|photolytic]] color change. Its organic compounds decompose by [[hydrolysis]] with prolonged exposure to water, while its inorganic compounds are attacked by [[acids]]. Deteriorated ivory is [[porous]], [[brittle]], and prone to impact damage and [[delamination]]. Many conservation problems are caused by previous conservation treatments such as incompatible and degraded [[coatings]], [[adhesives]], and attempts at reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/ivory.html |title= The care and handling of ivory objects |author= Smithsonian Institution |publisher= Smithsonian Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventive conservation==

===Handling===

When working with ivory objects it is important to wear white cotton gloves and if none are available be sure to thoroughly wash hands prior to touching the object.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; Since ivory is a porous material it is susceptible to staining. Ivory will yellow and/or brown with repeated contact to skin, fatty acids, and oils.

===Temperature and relative humidity===

Ivory is a hygroscopic material meaning that is absorbs and releases moisture with changing humidity. It is very reactive to its environment with the most severe changes linking to temperature and relative humidity. The relative humidity ideally is between 45-55% and the temperature at 70˚F (21.11˚C). If the relative humidity is too low it can lead to desiccation, shrinkage, and cracking. When the relative humidity it too high is can cause warping and swelling of the ivory.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; If the relative humidity exceeds 60% for a sustained time there is a chance that mold can develop on the ivory. It will be a white and greenish fuzzy growth that will require particular care and cleaning.&lt;ref name= "Storch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Storch |first=Paul S. |editor= Sherelyn Ogden |title=Caring for American Indian objects: a practical and cultural guide |year=2004 |publisher= Minnesota Historical Society |location=St.Paul, MN |isbn= 0-87351-505-6 |chapter= Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that temperature does not have as great of an impact on the condition of ivory that relative humidity does.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; Big fluctuations with either temperature of relative humidity is harmful. When the temperature fluctuates from normal to high heat it will cause expansion and contraction of the ivory.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt; Elevated temperatures can also result in a series of color changes.&lt;ref name="Craft" /&gt;

===Lighting===

Sunlight and artificial light can damage the surface of the ivory by discoloring (patina) as well as make it more brittle. Sunlit or spotlight display cases as well as any closed cases where heat can build up from interior light bulbs will cause further damage ivory. Dark storage areas will help to prevent damage to the ivory objects.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;

Lighting is kept at 5 foot-candles

===Integrated pest management===

Ivory is very rarely attacked by insects but benefits from being routinely inspected to ensure no pest activity. Rodents or other small mammals can cause structural damage by chewing on the surface of ivory.&lt;ref name= "Storch" /&gt;  By maintaining good housekeeping and having an [[integrated pest management]] program will help prevent infestations.

===Proper storage===

Tightly closed display cases or storage will provide protection from any sudden changes in temperature, relative humidity, dirt, and dust. Storage drawers lined with a chemically stable cushioning material, for example polyethylene or polypropylene will protect the surface of the ivory. Another option for storage is wrapping it in unbuffered, acid free tissue paper and stored in a sealed polyethylene bag. Well washed unbleached muslin or dipper fabrication can substitute the tissue. Avoid rubber based materials as it can cause unnatural yellowing of ivory.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt; 
Avoid storing or displaying ivory near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, and incandescent lights as they can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name= "Storch" /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==

===Cleaning===

If the ivory object is in good stable condition, cleaning the surface of dirt and grime with is appropriate.&lt;ref name="CHIN" /&gt;

If the dusting is not enough the ivory can be cleaned with a mixture of water and mild soap (such as Ivory Snow or WA Paste). Never soak ivory as the water could cause the dirt to become more visible by embedding it into cracks or pores.&lt;ref name="Pouliot"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pouliot |first=Bruno |editors= Onie Rollins |title=The Winterthur Guide to caring for your collection |year=2009 |publisher=The Henry Francis Du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc. |location=Delaware |isbn=978-0-912724-52-2 |chapter=Organic Materials }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many liquids can be destructive to ivory so avoid if possible or contact a professional.

===Stabilization and structural treatments===

Avoid over the counter adhesives when repairing cracks or breaks of ivory. These repairs are difficult and the use of poor adhesives can result in staining of the ivory and embrittlement as the adhesives age.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

Breaks and cracks can be important historically and show its use of the object. Unnecessary repairs can result in the loss of that historical information. Contact a conservator before any structural repairs are made.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

===Surface treatments===

Avoid wax or other protective coatings as they can age over time resulting in yellowing or darkening of the ivory surface. It can also obscure surface details that may be important to the object. The protective coatings can become difficult or even impossible to remove without damage to the object.&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt;

If possible to remove unstable surface treatments, do so with appropriate solvents. Use caution and have a professional consulted before doing any work on the ivory.&lt;ref name="Passmore" /&gt;

===Intervention===
Especially in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological contexts]], interventive treatment may in some cases be considered necessary. Such intervention is governed by [[conservation ethics]], in particular the principles of reversibility and [[minimum intervention]]. Possible treatments include the reduction of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] to prevent further deterioration, and the consolidation of delaminating and friable components. Any treatment should be undertaken by a [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Ward, Gerald W.R. |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art |year=2008 |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=299–301 |isbn=978-0-19-531391-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact a professional===

Ivory is extremely sensitive and reactive, if it is broken or extremely dirty please contact a professional conservator to conduct the repairs and extensive cleaning.

==Ethical concerns==

With the dramatic decline in population for African and Asian elephants along with [[poaching]] there are certain laws and regulations for ivory.

*The Lacey Act (1900 and later amendments) prohibits the trade of wildlife that is taken in violation of any state or foreign wildlife law or regulations. This affects interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*The Endangered Species Act (1973) is to help prevent the extinction of native and foreign species. It prohibits elephant parts and products from being imported into the United States except under certain conditions. Artifacts that are carved from elephant ivory may travel legally if it has documentation that proves its provenance pre-dates 1973.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) is made up of 180 countries to eliminate the illegal trade in animals, their parts, and associated products. CITES regulations do not take place of national laws. CITES has an Ivory Control System that is focused on the ivory trade.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;
*The African Elephant Conservation Act (1988) prohibits raw or worked ivory to be imported into the United States with some exceptions. It also established a grant program that funds elephant conservation work.&lt;ref name="Hornbeck" /&gt;

===Transportation regulations===

As of 2016, new regulations in the United States have been put into place regarding African-elephant Ivory and Asian-elephant Ivory. It is important to understand not only the federal laws but the state laws as well, as they can differ.&lt;ref name="Ivory Laws"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/stories/articles/2015/6/22/ivory-law/ |title=Overview of Current Ivory Law |author=Ben Phelan |date= 22 June 2015 |publisher=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African elephant ivory====
=====Import=====

Commercial Purposes: It is now illegal to import African elephant ivory (raw, worked, antique, or brand new) into the United States for any commercial purpose.

Non-Commercial Purposes: If the ivory was removed from the wild prior to February 26, 1976 and was otherwise legally acquired then the following can be imported into the United States for non-commercial purposes. 
*Musical instruments
*Items in a household move or that are part of an inheritance
*No more than two sport-hunted trophies per year (trophies must have appropriate permit that have been issued by the country hosting the hunt).&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

=====Sale &amp; export=====
Commercial Purposes: To commercially export an item containing ivory it must qualify as an antique, as defined by the Endangered Species Act. 
*The item has not been repaired or modified with ivory, or any other part of a federally protected species since 1973
*The item is at least 100 years old
*The item was either imported prior to 1982 or after 1982 through one of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or the item was manufactured in the United States from legally imported ivory.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

Non-commercial purposes: To be eligible it must be an antique as defined by the ESA, or it but have been created prior to 1979 and has not be bought or sold since that time. It is still illegal under federal law to export raw African elephant ivory for any purpose (commercial or non-commercial)

Interstate commerce: To be eligible for legal sale across state lines it must satisfy the laws of the relevant states and either be an antique as defined by the ESA or it must have been legally important into the United States prior to 1990 and contain only a small amount of ivory (de minimis exception).

Intrastate commerce: Under federal law, it the item was legally imported before 1990 or was imported with a CITES pre-convention certificate it can be sold within a state, if it also complies with relevant state and local laws.&lt;ref name= "Ivory Laws"/&gt;

====Asian elephant ivory====

=====Import, export, &amp; interstate commerce=====
It is legal if it meets the following criteria:

[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]
A '''crystal ball''', also known as an '''orbuculum''', is a [[crystal]] or [[glass]] ball and common [[fortune telling]] object.{{efn|Sometimes further referred to as a ''shew stone'' (or ''show stone'' {{ndash}} "shew" is an archaic spelling of "show").}} It is generally associated with the performance of [[clairvoyance]] and [[scrying]] in particular.

==History==
The earliest use of a crystal ball can be first attributed to the Celtic [[Druid]]s who divined the future and omens with [[beryl]] balls.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] describes use of crystal balls by [[Fortune-telling|soothsayers]] (''"crystallum orbis"'', later written in [[Medieval Latin]] by scribes as ''orbuculum'').&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|title=Caii Plinii Secundi Historiæ naturalis libri xxxvii, cum selectis comm. J. Harduini ac recentiorum interpretum novisque adnotationibus|date=1831|page=579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22orbis+crystallum%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=7 November 2015}} {{La icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 5th century AD, scrying was widespread within the [[Roman Empire]] and was condemned by the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|early medieval Christian Church]] as [[Christian views on magic|heretical]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal gazing|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/crystal-gazing|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] was a noted British mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and consultant to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He devoted much of his life to alchemy, divination, and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] philosophy, of which the use of crystal balls was often included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ensemble.va.com.au/tableau/suzy/TT_ResearchProjects/Hexen2039/JohnDee/JD_CBall.html John Dee's Crystal Ball]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal gazing was a popular pastime in the [[Victorian era]], and was claimed to work best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately before the appearance of a vision, the ball was said to mist up from within.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Art of scrying==
{{main article|Scrying|Crystal gazing}}
[[Image:Glaskugel CrystalBall.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a [[quartz]] crystal ball of the type commonly used for [[divination]] or [[scrying]]]]
The art or process of "seeing" is known as "[[scrying]]", whereby images are claimed to be seen in crystals, or other media such as water, and are interpreted as meaningful information. The "information" gleaned then is used to make important decisions in one's life (i.e. love, marriage, finances, travel, business, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Chauran, Alexandra. Crystal Ball Reading for Beginners: A Down To Earth Guide. Woodbury, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the technique of scrying is used with crystals, or any transparent body, it is known as crystallomancy or [[crystal gazing]].

==In stage magic==
Crystal balls are popular props used in [[mentalism]] acts by [[magic (illusion)|stage magicians]]. Such routines, in which the performer answers audience questions by means of various ruses, are known as crystal gazing acts. One of the most famous performers of the 20th century, [[Alexander (magician)|Claude Alexander]], was often billed as "Alexander the Crystal Seer".

==Properties==
A crystal ball is essentially a bi-convex [[spherical lens]] with a uniform [[radius of curvature]], although without its edges and center material truncated as in a conventional lens construction.  Thus the principles of [[optics]] may be applied to analyze its imaging characteristics.

As a lens, a transparent sphere of any material with [[refractive index]] greater than one bends rays of light to a [[focus (optics)|focal point]].  An image is formed with significant [[coma (optics)|coma]], [[field curvature]], and other [[optical aberrations]] inherent to spherical lenses. The refractive index of typical materials used for crystal balls (quartz: 1.46, window glass: 1.52), produces a central focal point just outside the surface of the sphere, on the side diametrically opposite to where the rays entered.

For materials with refractive index greater than 2, the focus will be located inside the sphere.  In this case the image is not directly accessible, while the closest accessible point is on its surface directly opposite the source of light. However, [[List of refractive indices|few materials]] have a refractive index this high. For a refractive index of 2, the image forms on the surface of the sphere, and the image may be viewed on an translucent object or diffusing coating on the imaging side of the sphere.

Since a crystal ball has no edges like a conventional lens, the image-forming properties are omnidirectional (independent of the direction being imaged). This effect is exploited in the [[Campbell–Stokes recorder]], a scientific instrument which records the brightness of sunlight by burning the surface of a paper card bent around the sphere.  The device, itself fixed, records the apparent motion and intensity of the sun across the sky, burning an image of the sun's motion across the card.

The omnidirectional [[burning glass]] effect can occur with a crystal ball that is brought into full sunlight.  The image of the sun formed by a large crystal ball will burn a hand that is holding it, and can ignite dark-coloured flammable material placed near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61176-2004Jan29.html|title=Crystal Ball Starts Fire at Okla. Home|last=Associated Press|date=29 January 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball lens]]es such as are used to couple [[fiber optics]] are identical to crystal balls, but in tiny form, commonly 1mm to 10mm in diameter.

==Famous crystal balls in history==
A crystal ball lies in the [[Honours of Scotland|Sceptre of Scotland]] that is said to have been originally possessed by pagan druids.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philadelphia]]'s [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] (also called ''Penn Museum'' for short) displays the third largest crystal ball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/335728|title=Crystal Sphere|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the central object in its [[Chinese art|Chinese]] [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]].

There's an audio game built into the [[Google Assistant]] on which tells the player to "Ask a Yes or No Question". The voice starts with an intro that says this line in a dramatic voice: "Come closer. Closer. Closer. Ok Stop. Close your eyes and open your mind. The Crystal Ball shall reveal the truth. Now ask a Yes or No Question." Then after the user asks a question, the voice responds with "The all knowing Crystal Ball says." and then gives a random answer. Also, if you ask it to play the [[Magic 8-ball]] the voice will say "Sorry, I don't have one of those. Instead I have a Crystal Ball." and opens the Crystal Ball game. The game also mentions about [[velvet]] [[curtains]] too.&lt;ref name="cball"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravenscraft |first1=Eric |title=The Best Games and Easter Eggs on Google Assistant |website=How-To Geek |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibited at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Paris]] and the 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York, Chicago and Boston. The original sculpture (approx six feet tall) was accidentally destroyed)]]
'''Cubist sculpture''' developed in parallel with [[Cubism|Cubist painting]], beginning in [[Paris]] around 1909 with its [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] phase, and evolving through the early 1920s. Just as Cubist painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in [[Paul Cézanne]]'s reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids; cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. Presenting fragments and facets of objects that could be visually interpreted in different ways had the effect of 'revealing the structure' of the object. Cubist sculpture essentially is the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] by shifting viewpoints of volume or mass in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces.

==History==
[[Image:Joseph Csaky, 1911-1912, Deux Femme (Two Women), plaster lost, photo Galerie René Reichard, Frankfurt, 72dpi.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Joseph Csaky]], 1911-1912, ''[[Groupe de femmes|Groupe de femmes (Groupe de trois femmes, Groupe de trois personnages)]]'', plaster lost, Exhibited at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]], 1913, Paris]]
In the historical analysis of most modern movements such as Cubism there has been a tendency to suggest that sculpture trailed behind painting. Writings about individual sculptors within the Cubist movement are commonly found, while writings about Cubist sculpture are premised on painting, offering sculpture nothing more than a supporting role.&lt;ref name = "Curtis"&gt;{{cite book| author = Penelope Curtis| title = Sculpture 1900-1945: After Rodin| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JjcxddXkJXUC&amp;pg=PA118| year = 1999| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-284228-2| page = 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are better advised, writes [[Penelope Curtis]], "to look at what is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist painting is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. "If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too", writes Curtis, "and we should look at what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

Increasingly, painters claim sculptural means of problem solving for their paintings. Braque's paper sculptures of 1911, for example, were intended to clarify and enrich his pictorial idiom. "This has meant" according to Curtis, "that we have tended to see sculpture through painting, and even to see painters as poaching sculpture. This is largely because we read Gauguin, Degas, Matisse, and Picasso as painters even when looking at their sculpture, but also because their sculptures often deserve to be spoken of as much as paintings as sculptures".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909–10, Head of a Woman (Fernande), modeled on Fernande Olivier.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909–10, ''Head of a Woman (Fernande)'', modeled on [[Fernande Olivier]]]]
A painting is meant both to capture the palpable three-dimensionality of the world revealed to the retina, and to draw attention to itself as a two-dimensional object, so that it is both a depiction and an object in itself.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.MoMA.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Such is the case for Picasso's 1909-10 ''Head of a Woman (Head of Fernande)'', often considered the first Cubist sculpture.&lt;ref name = "Eimert, Podoksik"&gt;{{cite book| author = Guillaume Apollinaire|author2=Dorothea Eimert |author3=Anatoli Podoksik | title = Cubism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=IE16991FHJwC&amp;pg=PA130| year = 2010| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-84484-749-5| page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Grace Glueck, ''Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too'', NY Times, exhibition review 1982] Retrieved July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Yet ''Head of a Woman'', writes Curtis, "had mainly revealed how Cubism was more interesting in Painting—where it showed in two dimensions how to represent three dimensions—than in sculpture".&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; Picasso's ''Head of a Woman'' was less adventurous than his painting of 1909 and subsequent years.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book| author = George Heard Hamilton| title = Painting and Sculpture in Europe: 1880-1940| url = https://books.google.com/?id=iy7orpwfvFEC&amp;pg=PA269| year = 1993| publisher = YALE University Press| isbn = 978-0-300-05649-5| page = 269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 ''Head'' bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are obviously a translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.&lt;ref name ="Duchamp-Villon"&gt;{{cite book| title = Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1876-1918| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_rZRAQAAIAAJ| year = 1967| publisher = | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art historian Douglas Cooper, "The first true Cubist sculpture was Picasso's impressive ''Woman's Head'', modeled in 1909-10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."&lt;ref name = "Cooper"&gt;{{cite book| author = Douglas Cooper| title = The Cubist Epoch| url = https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up| year = 1971| publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art| isbn = 978-0-7148-1448-3| pages = 11–221, 231–232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that in contrast to Cubist painters, Cubist sculptors did not create a new art of 'space-time'. Unlike a flat painting, high-relief sculpture from its volumetric nature could never be limited to a single view-point. Hence, as Peter Collins highlights, it is absurd to state that Cubist sculpture, like painting, was not limited to a single point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Peter Collins| title = Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture, 1750-1950| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1B_sNG-umxgC&amp;pg=PA279| date = 1998-07-14| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP| isbn = 978-0-7735-6705-4| page = 279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Cubist sculpture may seem "paradoxical", writes George Heard Hamilton, "because the fundamental Cubist situation was the representation on a two-dimensional surface of a multi-dimensional space at least theoretically impossible to see or to represent in the three dimensions of actual space, the temptation to move from a pictorial diagram to its spatial realization proved irresistible".&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Landschaft bei Paris, Paysage près de paris, Paysage de Courbevoie, oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover since 1937.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1912, ''Paysage près de paris, (Paysage de Courbevoie, Landschaft bei Paris)'', oil on canvas, 72.8 x 87.1 cm, missing from Hannover Germany since 1937]]
Now liberated from the one-to-one relationship between a fixed coordinate in space captured at a single moment in time assumed by classical vanishing-point perspective, the Cubist sculptor, just as the painter, became free to explore notions of ''simultaneity'', whereby several positions in space captured at successive time intervals could be depicted within the bounds of a single three-dimensional work of art.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, 'simultaneity' and 'multiple perspective' were not the only characteristics of Cubism. In Du "Cubisme" the painters [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] write:

:"Some, and they are not the least intelligent, see the aim of our technique in the exclusive study of volumes. If they were to add that it suffices, surfaces being the limits of volumes and lines those of surfaces, to imitate a contour in order to represent a volume, we might agree with them; but they are thinking only of the sensation of relief, which we hold to be insufficient. We are neither geometers nor sculptors: for us lines, surfaces, and volumes are only modifications of the notion of fullness. To imitate volumes only would be to deny these modifications for the benefit of a monotonous intensity. As well renounce at once our desire for variety.

More astonishing still, writes John Adkins Richardson, "is the fact that the artists participating in the [Cubist] movement not only created a revolution, they surpassed it, going on to create other styles of an incredible range and dissimilarity, and even devised new forms and techniques in sculpture and ceramic arts".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/course/ha/450/richardson.pdf John Adkins Richardson, ''Modern Art and Scientific Thought'', Chapter Five, ''Cubism and Logic''], University of Chicago Press, 1971, pp. 104-127&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cubists sculpture", writes Douglas Cooper, "must be discussed apart from the painting because it followed other paths, which were sometimes similar but never parallel".&lt;ref name = "Cooper" /&gt;

"But not infrequently the sculptor and the painter upset the equilibrium of the work of others by doing things which are out of key or out of proportion." (Arthur Jerome Eddy)&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cubistsandposti00eddygoog Arthur Jerome Eddy, Cubists and Post-Impressionism, A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., Chicago, 1914, second edition 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of diverging vantage-points for representing the features of objects or subject matter became a central factor in the practice of all Cubists, leading to the assertion, as noted by the art historian Christopher Green, "that Cubist art was essentially conceptual rather than perceptual". Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes in their 1912 writing, along with the writings by the critic [[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], were most responsible for the emphasis given to this claim. Raynal argued, echoing Metzinger and Gleizes, that the rejection of classical perspective in favor of multiplicity represented a break with the 'instantaneity' that characterized [[Impressionism]]. The mind now directed the optical exploration of the world. Painting and sculpture no longer merely recorded sensations generated through the eye; but resulted from the intelligence of both artist and observer. This was a mobile and dynamic investigation that explored multiple facets of the world.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thibault"&gt;Alexandre Thibault, ''La durée picturale chez les cubistes et futuristes comme conception du monde : suggestion d'une parenté avec le problème de la temporalité en philosophie'', Faculté des Lettres Université Laval, Québec, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of Cubist sculpture are as diverse as the origins of Cubist painting, resulting from a wide range of influences, experiments and circumstances, rather than from one source. With its roots stemming as far back as ancient Egypt, Greece and Africa, the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period (englobing both painting and sculpture) is characterized by the geometrization of form. It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase, in three-dimensional form, of an [[art movement]] known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].

The influences that characterize the transition from classical to modern sculpture range from diverse artistic movements ([[Post-Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]]), to the works of individual artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Charles Despiau]], [[Constantin Meunier]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] (among others), to [[African art]], [[Egyptian art]], [[Ancient Greek art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American art]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

Before the advent of Cubism artists had questioned the treatment of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] the [[Romanticism|romanticist]], [[Gustave Courbet]] the [[Realism (arts)|realist]], and virtually all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had jettisoned [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge to the ''static'' traditional means of expression.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1914 ''Cubists and Post-Impressionism'' [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] makes reference to [[Auguste Rodin]] and his relation to both [[Post-Impressionism]] and Cubism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The truth is there is more of Cubism in great painting than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists may serve to open our eyes to beauties we have always felt without quite understanding.

Take, for instance, the strongest things by Winslow Homer; the strength lies in the big, elemental manner in which the artist rendered his impressions in lines and masses which departed widely from photographic reproductions of scenes and people.

Rodin's bronzes exhibit these same elemental qualities, qualities which are pushed to violent extremes in Cubist sculpture. But may it not be profoundly true that these very extremes, these very extravagances, by causing us to blink and rub our eyes, end in a finer understanding and appreciation of such work as Rodin's?

His Balzac is, in a profound sense, his most colossal work, and at the same time his most elemental. In its simplicity, in its use of planes and masses, it is—one might say, solely for purposes of illustration—Cubist, with none of the extravagances of Cubism. It is purely Post-Impressionistic.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Paul Gauguin, 1894, Oviri (Sauvage), partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]], 1894, ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri (Sauvage)]]'', partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris. The theme of Oviri is death, savagery, wildness. Oviri stands over a dead she-wolf, while crushing the life out of her cub. As Gauguin wrote to [[Odilon Redon]], it is a matter of "life in death". From the back, Oviri looks like [[Auguste Rodin]]'s Balzac, a sort of menhir symbolizing the gush of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/sculpture/commentaire_id/oviri-11308.html?cHash=f88883513c Musée d'Orsay, Paul Gauguin, Oviri]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several factors mobilized the shift from a representational art form to one increasingly abstract; a most important factor would be found in the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], and his interpretation of nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone.&lt;ref name = "Erle Lora"&gt;{{cite book| author = Erle Loran| title = Cézannes̓ Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9| year = 1963| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-00768-0| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his tendency to simplify geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with rendering the effect of volume and space. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the complex treatment of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a planar faceting effect. In his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, with larger, bolder, more arbitrary faceting, with dynamic and increasingly abstract results. As the colors planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

Avant-garde artists working in Paris had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne following a retrospective of his paintings at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, and exhibitions of his work at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne, in combination with the impact of diverse cultures, suggests a means by which artists (including [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri le Fauconnier]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]) made the transition to diverse forms of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the extreme to which the Cubist painters and sculptors exaggerated the distortions created by the use of multiple perspective and the depiction of forms in terms of planes is the late work of Paul Cézanne, led to a fundamental change in the formal strategy and relationship between artist and subject not anticipated by Cézanne.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

===Africa, Egyptian, Greek and Iberian art===
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|120px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]
Another factor in the shift towards abstraction was the increasing exposure to [[Prehistoric art]], and art produced by various cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]]. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Rousseau]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] were inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of artworks produced by these cultures.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[Tribal art]], [[Iberian sculpture]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as [[proto-Cubism]], as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications, along with expressive features reminiscent of [[El Greco]], are the generally assumed starting point for the [[Proto-Cubism]] of Picasso. He began working on studies for [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. But that wasn't all. Aside from further influences of the Symbolists, [[Pierre Daix]] explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. And too, without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism came not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Victoria Charles| title = Pablo Picasso| url = https://books.google.com/?id=W09TW-75Be0C&amp;pg=PA78| year = 2011| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-78042-299-2| page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Anatoli Podoksik|author2=Victoria Charles| title = Pablo Picasso| url = https://books.google.com/?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&amp;pg=PA81| year = 2011| publisher = Parkstone International| isbn = 978-1-78042-285-5| page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists (and art collectors) prized objects from different cultures for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N. Broude and M. Garrard (Eds.). New York: Harper Collins, 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted not just Picasso, but many of the Parisian avant-garde that transited through a proto-Cubist phase. While some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others such as Derain and Matisse chose different paths. And others still such as Brâncuși and Modigliani exhibited with the Cubists yet defied classification as Cubists.

In ''The Rise if Cubism'' [[Daniel Henry Kahnweiler]] writes of the similarities between African art with Cubist painting and sculpture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the years 1913 and 1914 Braque and Picasso attempted to eliminate the use of color as chiaroscuro, which had still persisted to some extent in their painting, by amalgamating painting and sculpture. Instead of having to demonstrate through shadows how one plane stands above, or in front of a second plane, they could now superimpose the planes one on the other and illustrate the relationship directly. The first attempts to do this go far back. Picasso had already begun such an enterprise in 1909, but since he did it within the limits of closed form, it was destined to fail. It resulted in a kind of colored bas-relief. Only in open planal form could this union of painting and sculpture be realized. Despite current prejudice, this endeavor to increase plastic expression through the collaboration of the two arts must be warmly approved; an enrichment of the plastic arts is certain to result from it. A number of sculptors like Lipchitz, Laurens and Archipenko have since taken up and developed this sculpto-painting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Nor is this form entirely new in the history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of expression in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple strip of wood, two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, and the hair is represented by raffia. It is true that the form is still closed here; however, it is not the "real" form, but rather a tight formal scheme of plastic primeval force. Here, too, we find a scheme of forms and "real details" (the painted eyes, mouth and hair) as stimuli. The result in the mind of the spectator, the desired effect, is a human face."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, ''The Rise of Cubism'', The documents of modern art; Wittenborn, Schultz, translated by Henry Aronson, notice by Robert Motherwell, New York, 1949. First published under the title ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'', in 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as in painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in [[Paul Cézanne]]'s reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones) along with the arts of diverse cultures. In the spring of 1908 Picasso worked on the representation of three-dimensional form and its position in space on a two-dimensional surface. "Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures", wrote Kanhweiler, "and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne".&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

==Cubist styles==
[[File:Alexander Archipenko, 1912, Femme Marchante (Woman Walking). Reproduced in Archipenko-Album, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Archipenko]], 1912, ''Femme Marchant (Woman Walking)'']]
The diverse styles of Cubism have been associated with the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] exhibited exclusively at the Kahnweiler gallery. However, alternative contemporary views on Cubism have formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]), whose methods and ideas were too distinct from those of Braque and Picasso to be considered merely secondary to them.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt; Cubist sculpture, just as Cubist painting, is difficult to define. Cubism in general cannot definitively be called either a style, the art of a specific group or even a specific movement. "It embraces widely disparate work, applying to artists in different milieux". (Christopher Green)&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

Artist sculptors working in [[Montparnasse]] were quick to adopt the language of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], rendering three-dimensional objects by shifting viewpoints and of volume or mass in terms of successive curved or flat planes and surfaces. [[Alexander Archipenko]]'s 1912 ''Walking Woman'' is cited as the first modern sculpture with an abstracted void, i.e., a hole in the middle. [[Joseph Csaky]], following Archipenko, was the first sculptor to join the Cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onward. They were joined by [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and then in 1914 by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and later [[Ossip Zadkine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism," Readings in Art History 2 (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"/&gt;

According to [[Herbert Read]], this has the effect of "revealing the structure" of the object, or of presenting fragments and facets of the object to be visually interpreted in different ways. Both of these effects transfer to sculpture. Although the artists themselves did not use these terms,&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt; the distinction between "analytic cubism" and "synthetic cubism" could also be seen in sculpture, writes Read (1964): "In the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque, the definite purpose of the geometricization of the planes is to emphasize the formal structure of the motif represented. In the synthetic Cubism of [[Juan Gris]] the definite purpose is to create an effective formal pattern, geometricization being a means to this end."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Sculpture'', Praeger, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander Archipenko===
[[File:Alexander Archipenko, 1913, Femme à l'Éventail (Woman with a Fan), 108 x 61.5 x 13.5 cm, Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Reproduced in Archipenko-Album, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Archipenko]], 1913, ''Femme à l'Éventail (Woman with a Fan)'', 108 x 61.5 x 13.5 cm, [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]
[[Alexander Archipenko]] studied Egyptian and archaic Greek figures in the [[Louvre]] in 1908 when he arrived in Paris. He was "the first", according to Barr, "to work seriously and consistently at the problem of Cubist sculpture". His torso entitled "Hero" (1910) appears related stylistically to Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], "but in its energetic three-dimensional torsion it is entirely independent of Cubist painting." (Barr)&lt;ref name = "Barr"&gt;{{cite book| author = Alfred Hamilton Barr| title = Cubism and abstract art: painting, sculpture, constructions, photography, architecture, industrial art, theatre, films, posters, typography| url = https://books.google.com/?id=03_uAAAAMAAJ| year = 1936| publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-17935-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archipenko evolved in close contact with the Salon Cubists ([[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others). At the same time, his affinities with [[Futurism]] were documented by the British magazine ''The Sketch'' in October 1913, where Archipenko's ''Dancers (Dance)'', reproduced on its front cover, was described as a 'Futurist sculpture'.&lt;ref name="Keiser"&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/docs/alexandra_keiser_0.pdf Alexandra Keiser (Archipenko Foundation/Courtauld Institute of Art), ''Photographic reproductions of Sculpture: Archipenko and Cultural Exchange'', Henry Moore Institute, 12 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; "In this work", writes Alexandra Keiser, "two abstracted figures are engaged in a dynamic dance movement." Moreover, the chiaroscuro observed in the photographic reproduction "accentuated the artist's multi-faceted use of positive and negative space as a compositional element to create dynamic movement, in both the fragmentation of the dancers' bodies as well as in the void created between their bodies". In the photographic reproduction of ''Dancers'', writes Keiser, "the sculpture is set off at an angle reinforcing the idea of dynamism and creating the illusion that the sculpture is propelled through space. The sculpture ''Dance'' itself as well as the style of its reproduction played strongly to the generalized notions of Futurism and to the idea that sculpture could be conceived as a specifically modern medium".&lt;ref name="Keiser" /&gt;

[[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin described Archipenko as 'the most important sculptor of our time'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/einblickin00wald Herwarth Walden, ''Einblick in Kunst: Expressionismus, Futurismus, Kubismus'']. Berlin: Der Sturm, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; Walden also promoted Archipenko as the foremost [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] sculptor. (Before [[World War I]] ''Expressionism'' encompassed several definitions and artistic concepts. Walden used the term to describe modern art movements including Futurism and Cubism).&lt;ref name="Keiser" /&gt;

Archipenko's ''Woman with a Fan'' (1914) combines high-relief sculpture with painted colors (polychrome) to create striking illusions of volumetric space. Experimenting with the dynamic interplay of convex and concave surfaces, Archipenko created works such as ''Woman Combing her Hair'' (1915). Depending on the movement around the sculpture and effects of lighting, concave and convex surfaces appear alternately to protrude or recede. His use of sculptural voids was inspired by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s ''Creative Evolution'' (1907) on the distortions of our understanding of reality, and how our intellect tends to define unanticipated circumstances positively or negatively. 'If the present reality is not one we are seeking, we speak of an absence of this sought reality wherever we find the presence of another'. "Archipenko's sculptural voids", write Antliff and Leighten, "allows us to fill this illusory gap with our own durational consciousness".&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

In 1914, [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] examined what made Archipenko's sculpture, ''Family Life'', exhibited at the [[Armory Show]] unique, powerful, modern and Cubist:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In his "Family Life," the group of man, woman, child, Archipenko deliberately subordinated all thought of beauty of form to an attempt to realize in stone the relation in life that is at the very basis of human and social existence.

Spiritual, emotional, and mathematical intellectuality, too, is behind the family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression is made in the simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The group is so angular, so ''Cubist'', so ugly according to accepted notions, that few look long enough to see what the sculptor means; yet strange as the group was it undeniably gave a powerful impression of the binding, the ''blending'' character of the family tie, a much more powerful impression than groups in conventional academic pose could give.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Joseph Csaky===
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Head (Portrait d'homme), 1913, Plaster lost or destroyed, Published in Montjolie, March 1914.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''Head (self-portrait)'', 1913, Plaster lost. Photo published in Montjoie, 1914]]
[[Joseph Csaky]] arrived in Paris from his native Hungary during the summer of 1908. By autumn of 1908 Csaky shared a studio space at Cité Falguière with [[Joseph Brummer]], a Hungarian friend who had opened the Brummer Gallery with his brothers. Within three weeks, Brummer showed Csaky a sculpture he was working on: an exact copy of an [[African art|African sculpture]] from the Congo. Brummer told Csaky that another artist in Paris, a Spaniard by the name of [[Pablo Picasso]], was painting in the spirit of 'Negro' sculptures.&lt;ref name = "Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author = Edith Balas| title = Joseph Csáky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture| url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ| year = 1998| publisher = American Philosophical Society| isbn = 978-0-87169-230-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living and working at [[La Ruche]] in [[Montparnasse]], Csaky exhibited his highly stylized 1909 sculpture ''Tête de femme (Portrait de Jeanne)'' at the 1910 [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], now significantly beyond the influence of [[Auguste Rodin]]. The following year he exhibited a proto-Cubist work entitled ''Mademoiselle Douell'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Félix Marcilhac, ''Joseph Csaky, Une Vie - Une Oeuvre'', 23 Nov. - 21 Dec. 2007, exhibit catalogue, Galerie Félix Marcilhac&lt;/ref&gt;

Csaky's proto-Cubist works include ''Femme et enfant'' (1909), collection Zborovsky, ''Tête de femme de profil'' (1909), exhibited Société National des Beaux-Arts, 1910, ''Tête de femme de face'' (1909). By 1910-11 Csaky's Cubist works included ''Tête d'homme, Autoportrait, Tête Cubiste'' (1911), exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1911.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac"&gt;Marcilhac, Félix, 2007, ''Joseph Csaky, Du cubisme historique à la figuration réaliste, catalogue raisonné des sculptures'', Les Editions de l'Amateur, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Csaky exhibited his Cubist sculptures, including ''Mademoiselle Douell'' (no. 1831) at the ''[[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]]'' (21 April - 13 June) with Archipenko, [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Marie Laurencin|Laurencin]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye|La Fresnaye]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] and [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]]. This exhibition provoked a scandal out of which Cubism was revealed to the general public for the first time. From that exhibition it emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond.

Four months later Csaky exhibited at the ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' (1 October - 8 November) in room XI together with the same artists, in addition to [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] and [[František Kupka]], his ''[[Groupe de femmes]]'' (1911–1912), a massive, highly stylized block-like sculpture representing three women. At the same Salon Csaky exhibited ''Portrait de M.S.H.'', no. 91, his deeply faceted ''[[Danseuse (Csaky)|Danseuse (Femme à l'éventail, Femme à la cruche)]]'', no. 405, and ''Tête d'homme (''Tête d'adolescent)'' no. 328, the first in a series of self-portraits that would become increasingly abstract in accord with his Cubist sensibility.&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt;

The following spring, Csaky showed at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (1913) with the same group, including [[André Lhote|Lhote]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon|Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Jacques Villon|Villon]].

Csaky exhibited as a member of [[Section d'Or]] at the Galerie La Boétie (10–30 October 1912), with Archipenko, Duchamp-Villon, La Fresnaye, Gleizes, Gris, Laurencin, Léger, Lhote, Marcoussis, Metzinger, Picabia, Kupka, Villon and Duchamp.

At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants, held March 9 through 18 May, Csaky exhibited his 1912 ''Tête de Femme (Buste de femme)'', an exceedingly faceted sculpture later purchased by [[Léonce Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Marcilhac" /&gt; The Cubist works were shown in room 46. Metzinger exhibited his large ''L'Oiseau bleu'' — [[Albert Gleizes]], Albert Gleizes. ''Les Joueurs de football'' (Football Players)'' 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — [[Robert Delaunay]] ''The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )'' 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — [[Fernand Léger]], ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)'' 1912-13, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — [[Juan Gris]], ''L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)'' 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The inspirations that led Csaky to Cubism were diverse, as they were for artists of [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]], and other still of the [[Section d'Or]]. Certainly [[Cézanne]]'s geometric syntax was a significant influence, as well as [[Seurat]]'s scientific approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to transform their expression. Now at 9 rue Blainville in the fifth arrondissement in Paris Csaky—along with the Cubist sculptors who would follow—stimulated by the profound cultural changes and his own experiences, contributed his own personal artistic language to the movement.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky wrote of the direction his art had taken during the crucial years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was no question which was my way. True, I was not alone, but in the company of several artists who came from Eastern Europe. I joined the cubists in the [[Académie de La Palette|Académie La Palette]], which became the sanctuary of the new direction in art. On my part I did not want to imitate anyone or anything. This is why I joined the cubists movement." (Joseph Csaky&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joseph Csaky contributed substantially to the development of modern sculpture, both as an early pioneer in applying Cubist principles to sculpture, and as a leading figure in nonrepresentational art of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

===Raymond Duchamp-Villon===
[[Image:Two views of 'The Large Horse', a bronze sculpture by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1914, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], ''Two views of 'The Large Horse,'' bronze, 1914, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]]]
Although some comparison can be drawn between the mask-like totemic characteristics of various Gabon sculptures, [[Tribal art|primitive art]] was well beyond the conservative French sensibilities visible in the work of [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]]. [[Gothic art|Gothic sculpture]], on the other hand, seems to have provided Duchamp-Villon the impetus for expressing novel possibilities of human representation, in a manner parallel to that provided by [[African art]] for Derain, Picasso, Braque and others.&lt;ref name="Duchamp-Villon" /&gt;

To his credit, Duchamp-Villon exhibited early on with the Cubists ([[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri le Fauconnier]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Joseph Csaky]]) at the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]]; a massive public Cubist manifestation that caused yet another scandal, following from the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1911. His role as architect of ''la Maison Cubiste (Cubist house)'' propelled him into the center of a politico-social scandal that accused the Cubists of ''foreign aesthetic inspiration''.&lt;ref name="Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel"&gt;[http://histoiremesure.revues.org/index2333.html Béatrice Joyeux-Prunel, ''Histoire &amp; Mesure'', no. XXII -1 (2007), Guerre et statistiques, ''L'art de la mesure, Le Salon d'Automne (1903-1914), l'avant-garde, ses étranger et la nation française''] (The Art of Measure: The Salon d'Automne Exhibition (1903-1914), the Avant-Garde, its Foreigners and the French Nation), electronic distribution Caim for Éditions de l'EHESS (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the same group, including his brothers [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], he exhibited at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in the fall of 1912.

In ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' (1913) [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] writes of Duchamp-Villon:
:"The utilitarian end aimed at by most of the contemporary architects in the cause which keeps architecture considerably behind the other arts. The architect, the engineer should build with sublime intentions: to erect the highest tower, to prepare for time and the ivy, a ruin more beautiful than any other, to throw over a harbour or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, to compose above all a persistent harmony the most audacious that man has ever know.

:Duchamp-Villon has this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and architect, light in the only thing that counts for him, and for all the other arts also, it is only light which counts, the incorruptible light." (Apollinaire, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Aesthetic Meditations On Painting, The Cubist Painters'' (1913), Second Series, translated and published in ''The Little Review'', Miscellany Number, Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Winter 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacques Lipchitz===
[[File:'Sculpture', plaster sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz, 1916, Tate Modern.JPG|thumb|110px|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1916, ''Sculpture'', plaster, 116.9 x 36.8 x 34.2 cm, [[Tate Modern]]]]
The early sculptures of [[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1911-1912, were conventional portraits and figure studies executed in the tradition of [[Aristide Maillol]] and [[Charles Despiau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Jacques Lipchitz|author2=Alan G. Wilkinson| title = Jacques Lipchitz: The Cubist Period, 1913-1930 : [exhibition] October 15 - November 14, 1987, Marlborough Gallery| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XBlQAQAAIAAJ| year = 1987| publisher = Marlborough Gallery| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He progressively turned toward Cubism in 1914 with periodic reference to Negro sculpture. His 1915 ''Baigneuse'' is comparable to figures from Gabun. In 1916 his figures became more abstract, though less so than those of Brâncuși's sculptures of 1912-1915.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; Lipchitz' ''Baigneuse Assise'' (70.5&amp;nbsp;cm) of 1916 is clearly reminiscent of Csaky's 1913 ''Figure de Femme Debout, 1913 (Figure Habillée)'' (80&amp;nbsp;cm), exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913, with the same architectonic rendering of the shoulders, head, torso, and lower body, both with an angular pyramidal, cylidrical and spherical geometric armature. Just as some of the works of Picasso and Braque of the period are virtually indistinguishable, so too are Csaky's and Lipchitz sculptures, only Csaky's predates that of Lipchitz by three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s289.photobucket.com/user/DVDjHex/media/Artworks%20online/CsakyFiguredeFemmeDebout1913vsLipchitzBaigneuseAssise1916.jpg.html?&amp;_suid=136481340159408369980021379888 Joseph Csaky, 1913, ''Figure de Femme Debout (Figure Habillée)'', vs. Jacques Lipchitz, 1916, ''Baigneuse Assise'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and [[Henri Laurens]] were aware of primitive [[African art]], though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, appears to have been entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance to idea first pronounced by [[Jean Metzinger]] in his 1910 ''Note sur la peinture''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51&lt;/ref&gt; of simultaneous multiple views. "They were", as Goldwater notes, "undoubtedly impressed with the natural three-dimensionality of African sculpture and with its rhythmic interplay of solid and related void. But in its frontality and mass, though often composed of ''cubic'' shapes, it was anything but cubist, and was indeed, fundamentally anti-cubist in conception".&lt;ref name = "Goldwater"&gt;{{cite book| author = Robert Goldwater| title = Primitivism in Modern Art: | url = https://books.google.com/?id=l-Ldmim-CA0C&amp;pg=PA230| year = 1986| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-70490-9| page = 230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The African sculptor, writes Goldwater, "whether his forms were rectangular, elliptical, or round in outline, and whether he cut back little or much into the cylinder of fresh wood with which he began, was content to show one aspect of his figure at a time". Goldwater continues: :"He achieved his "instinctive" three-dimensional effect by calculated simplification and separation of parts that allowed the eye to grasp each one as a unified, coherent mass. The cubist sculptor, on the other hand, wished to "make his figure turn" by simultaneously showing or suggesting frontal and orthogonal planes, by flattening diagonals, and by swinging other hidden surfaces into view."&lt;ref name="Goldwater" /&gt;

===Henri Laurens===
[[File:Henri Laurens, 1920, Le Petit boxeur, 43 cm, reproduced in Život 2 (1922), p 53.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Henri Laurens]], 1920, ''Le Petit boxeur'', 43 cm, reproduced in Život 2 (1922)]]
Some time after Joseph Csaky's 1911-14 sculptural figures consisting of conic, cylindrical and spherical shapes, a translation of two-dimensional form into three-dimensional form had been undertaken by the French sculptor [[Henri Laurens]]. He had met Braque in 1911 and exhibited at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, but his mature activity as a sculptor began in 1915 after experimenting with different materials.&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt;

===Umberto Boccioni===
[[File:Umberto Boccioni, Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action, plaster, photograph published in 1914.jpg|thumb|left|[[Umberto Boccioni]] , c.1912, ''Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action'', plaster]]
[[Umberto Boccioni]] exhibited his [[Futurism|Futurist]] sculptures in Paris in 1913 after having studied the works of Archipenko, Brâncuși, Csaky, and Duchamp-Villon. Boccioni's background was in painting, as his Futurist colleagues, but unlike others was impelled to adapt the subjects and atmospheric faceting of Futurism to sculpture.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt; For Boccioni, physical motion is relative, in opposition with absolute motion. The Futurist had no intention of abstracting reality. "We are not against nature," wrote Boccioni, "as believed by the innocent late bloomers [retardataires] of realism and naturalism, but against art, that is, against immobility."&lt;ref name="Thibault" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Boccioni, ''Dynamisme plastique : peinture et sculpture futuriste'', Lausanne, L'Age d'homme, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; While common in painting, this was rather new in sculpture. Boccioni expressed in the preface of the catalogue for the ''First Exhibition of Futurist Sculpture'' his wish to break down the stasis of sculpture by the utilization of diverse materials and coloring grey and black paint of the edges of the contour (to represent [[chiaroscuro]]). Though Boccioni had attacked [[Medardo Rosso]] for adhering closely to pictorial concepts, Lipchitz described Boccioni's 'Unique Forms' as a relief concept, just as a futurist painting translated into three-dimensions.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

===Constantin Brâncuși===
[[File:Constantin Brancusi, 1907-08, The Kiss, Exhibited at the Armory Show and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913..jpg|thumb|[[Constantin Brâncuși]], 1907-08, ''The Kiss'', Exhibited at the [[Armory Show]] and published in the Chicago Tribune, 25 March 1913]]
The works of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] differ considerably from others through lack of severe planar faceting often associated with those of prototypical Cubists such as Archipenko, Csaky and Duchamp-Villon (themselves already very different from one another). However, in common is the tendency toward simplification and abstract representation.

Before reviewing the works of Brâncuși, [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]] writes of [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]]:

:"The two female figures exhibited by Lehmbruck, were simply decorative elongations of natural forms. In technic they were quite conventional. Their modeling was along purely classical lines, far more severely classical than much of the realistic work of Rodin."

The heads by Brâncuși were idealistic in the extreme; the sculptor carried his theories of mass and form so far he deliberately lost all resemblance to actuality. He uses his subjects as motives rather than models. In this respect he is not unlike—though more extreme than—the great Japanese and Chinese artists, who use life and nature arbitrarily to secure the results they desire.

I have a golden bronze head—a "Sleeping Muse," by Brâncuși—so simple, so severe in its beauty, it might have come from the Orient.

Of this head and two other pieces of sculpture exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in ''The Nation'', August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But it seemed to me there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eddy elaborates on Brâncuși and Archipenko:
:"It is when we come to the work of Brâncuși and Archipenko that we find the most startling examples of the reaction along purely creative lines.

Nature is purposely left far behind, as far behind as in Cubist pictures, and for very much the same reasons.

Of all the sculpture in the International Exhibition [[Armory Show]] the two pieces that excited the most ridicule were Brâncuși's egg-shaped ''Portrait of Mlle. Pogany'' and ''Family Life'' by Archipenko.

Both are creative works, products of the imagination, but in their inspiration they are fundamentally different.&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;

==By World War I==
[[File:Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, 1914, Boy with a Coney (Boy with a rabbit), marble.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], 1914, ''Boy with a Coney (Boy with a rabbit)'', marble]]
In June 1915 the young modern sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] lost his life in the war. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter and sent it to friends in London:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been fighting for two months and I can now gage the intensity of life.[...]

It would be folly to seek artistic emotions amid these little works of ours.[...]

My views on sculpture remain absolutely the same.

It is the vortex of will, of decision, that begins.

I shall derive my emotions solely from the arrangement of surfaces. I shall present my emotions by the arrangement of my surfaces, the planes and lines by which they are defined.

Just as this hill, where the Germans are solidly entrenched, gives me a nasty feeling, solely because its gentle slopes are broken up by earthworks, which throw long shadows at sunset—just so shall I get feeling, of whatsoever definition, from a statue according to its slopes, varied to infinity.

I have made an experiment. Two days ago I pinched from an enemy a mauser rifle. Its heavy, unwieldy shape swamped me with a powerful image of brutality.

I was in doubt for a long time whether it pleased or displeased me.

I found that I did not like it.

I broke the butt off and with my knife I carved in it a design, through which I tried to express a gentler order of feeling, which I preferred.

But I will emphasize that my design got its effect (just as the gun had) from a very simple composition of lines and planes. (Gaudier-Brzeska, 1915)&lt;ref name="Eddy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experimentation in three-dimensional art had brought sculpture into the world of painting, with unique pictorial solutions. By 1914 it was clear that sculpture had moved inexorably closer to painting, becoming a formal experiment, one inseparable from the other.&lt;ref name="Curtis" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, significant Cubist sculpture had been done in Sweden (by sculptor [[Bror Hjorth]]), in Prague (by Gutfreund and his collaborator [[Emil Filla]]), and at least two dedicated "Cubo-Futurist" sculptors were on staff at the Soviet art school [[Vkhutemas]] in Moscow ([[Boris Korolev]] and [[Vera Mukhina]]).

The movement had run its course by about 1925, but Cubist approaches to sculpture didn't end as much as they became a pervasive influence, fundamental to the related developments of [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]], [[Futurism]], [[Die Brücke]], [[De Stijl]], [[Dada]], [[Abstract art]], [[Surrealism]] and [[Art Deco]].

{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}
In [[Indic scripts]], the '''danda''' ([[Sanskrit]]: दण्ड ''{{IAST|daṇḍa}}'' "stick") is a [[punctuation]] [[character (computing)|character]]. The [[glyph]] consists of a single vertical stroke. The character can be found at [[character encoding|code point]] U+0964 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0964;}}) in [[Unicode]]. The "double danda" is at  U+0965 ({{script|Deva|&amp;#x0965;}}). [[ISCII]] encodes danda at 0xEA.

The danda marks the end of a sentence or period, comparable to a [[full stop]] (period) as commonly used in the [[Latin alphabet]], and is used alternate with Western punctuation in most modern [[Languages of India|Indic]] languages. In metrical texts, a double danda is used to delimit verses, and a single danda to delimit a [[pada (foot)|pada]] or semi-verse.

The '''dematerialization''' of a product literally means less, or better yet, no material is used to deliver the same level of functionality to the user. Sharing, borrowing and the organization of group services that facilitate and cater for communities needs could alleviate the requirement of [[ownership]] of many products.

In his book ‘'In the Bubble: designing in a complex world'’, John Thakara states that "the average consumer power tool is used for ten minutes in its entire life - but it takes hundreds of times its own weight to [[manufacture]] such an object”. A [[product service system]] with shared tools could simply offer access to them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World

| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift from a reliance on [[Product (business)|products]] to [[Service (economics)|services]] is the process of dematerialization. Digital music distribution systems, car clubs, bike hire schemes and laundry services are all examples of dematerialization.

'''''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] edited by [[Helaine Selin]] and published by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] in 1997, with a second edition in  2008, and third edition in 2016.

==Summary==
From the Preface:
:The purpose of the ''Encyclopaedia'' is to bring together knowledge of many disparate fields in one place to legitimize the study of other cultures' science... The Western academic divisions of science, technology and medicine have been united in the ''Encyclopaedia'' because in ancient cultures these disciplines were connected.
The first edition (1997) has 600 articles by a range of experts. The arrangement is alphabetical from "Abacus" to "Zu Chongzi". It includes an index from page 1079 to page 1117. [[K. V. Sarma]] contributed 35 articles, Greg De Young 13, Boris A. Rosenfeld 12, and Emilia Calvo and Ho Peng Yoke 11 each. [[Fabrizio Pregadio]] contributed 10 articles, Julio Samo wrote 9, and Richard Bertschinger, [[Radha Charan Gupta]] and [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] wrote 8 each. Dozens of other contributors wrote fewer articles.

In 2008 the ''Encyclopaedia'' was split into two volumes and extended to 1000 articles for a second edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/book/978-1-4020-4559-2 Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
* Toby E. Huff (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] 90(2):410,1 {{doi|10.1086/284409}}
: "A splendid piece of joint scholarship, and some would say long overdue."
: Huff counts nine entries on maps and map making, five on geometry, eleven on environment, four on city planning, five on east-west issues, six on colonialism, six on textile technology, ten on weights and measures
* Jensine Andresen (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] {{doi|10.1111/0591-2385.00218}}
: Dispels the illusion that "members of non-Western cultures have offered only marginal contributions to the rigorous investigation of the natural world".
: "Catalyzes a thorough reconsideration of the scope of the ideational nexus influencing the interaction between religion and science in the West."
: Andresen characterizes the contributors an "iconoclastic bunch".
* Sujit Sivasundaram (2010) Review: EHSTMNC second edition, [[The British Journal for the History of Science]] {{doi|10.1017/S000708741000049X}}
: "Turning points in the European historical narrative are being contextualized within other senses of chronology and space, and so decentralized from their mythic status as events in the birth of modern science."
: The second edition shifts "from advocacy to analysis". The reviewer considers the term ''Non-Western'' to be outdated, particularly as [[ethnobotany]] regions proliferate, and Europe is excluded except as the colonizer.

'''Ethnomuseology''' is the study of [[museum]]s and museum curation in the context of the culture and cultural traditions of its collections. It is an interdisciplinary field combining [[museum studies]], [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and often various [[fine arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucur August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As stated by Moira Simpson, "Ethnomuseology is the field of scholarship concerning culturally appropriate museum curation and conservation of ethnographic materials using methods that reflect social, cultural, spiritual, or religious aspects of objects."{{fact|date=November 2015}} A museum subscribing the principles of ethnomuseology will often maintain and present artifacts and collections in the traditional manner of their ethnological origins, combining the museum with the rituals and community of its theme.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2007, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; This can be in addition to conventional Western museum practices, which often focuses on object materiality. As well, ethnomuseology often involves a continued dialog between museum administrators and members of represented cultures in collections. The ''Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology'' considers ethnomuseology to be a "more holistic" approach to [[heritage interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, pp. 2549-2551&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "ethnomuseology" is first seen in Romania and Czechoslovakia in the 1980s, where it described the use of artifacts from rural life to "[provide] evidence of authentic forms of culture". A variant, "etnomuseologia", was used in 1994 by the Romanian anthropologist Bert G. Ribeiro to describe the work of the [[Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi]] in [[Belem, Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, p. 2550&lt;/ref&gt; In Belem, curators had been working directly with Amazonian Indians in a continued dialog to create exhibits informed by the very culture they documented.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a number of museums are considered to be followers the ethnomuseological method, including the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Alutiiq Museum]] in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], and the Department of Ethnology at the [[Museum of Macedonia]] in [[Skopje, Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 2014, p. 2551&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Namicev 1994, pp. 179-184&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, [[Masaryk University]] in [[Brno, Czech Republic]] has offered a course in ethnomuseology titled "MUII165 Practice in museology and ethnography".&lt;ref&gt;"MUII165 Practice in museology and ethnography"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The summary found in the opening paragraphs give the impression that the article is more concerned with language learning than extensive reading. --&gt;'''Extensive reading''', '''free reading''', '''book flood''', or '''reading for pleasure''' is a way of [[language learning]], including [[foreign language]] learning, through large amounts of reading. As well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary, it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits. It is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education. Proponents such as Krashen (1989) claim that reading alone will increase encounters with unknown words, bringing learning opportunities by [[inferencing]]. The learner's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. While the mechanism is commonly accepted as true, its importance in language learning is disputed. ({{harvnb|Cobb|2007|p= }})

[[File:Silent Reading time in a Lao school.jpg|thumb|About half of all children in rural Laos speak a minority ethnic language at home, and have difficulty in school, which is taught only in the Lao language. This primary school in Laos began a daily reading period in September 2013, in which children select a book to read simply for enjoyment. Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project that sponsored the program, began conducting a study in 2013 to measure reading and vocabulary improvements in schools that had this program.]]

In language learning, extensive reading is contrasted with ''intensive reading'', which is slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text – it is when one is "focused on the language rather than the text".&lt;ref name="waring"&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/er/what_and_why/what_is_er.htmm Extensive Reading FAQ], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently;&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt; intensive reading is, however, the more common approach, and often the only one used.&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt;

Extensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century (with [[Latin]]; [[#Translation of modern literature|see below]]). In the first language, many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size, as well as other academic skills.

== Concepts ==
''Free voluntary reading'' refers to using extensive reading in language education. Students are free to choose a book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim of a free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized or eliminated entirely.

The idea behind extensive reading is that a lot of reading of interesting material that is slightly below, at, or barely above the full comprehension level of the reader will foster improved language skills. [[Graded reader]]s are often used. For foreign-language learners, some researchers have found that the use of [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]]es for "difficult" words is advantageous to [[vocabulary]] acquisition ({{harvnb|Rott|Williams|Cameron|2002}}) but at least one study finds it has no effect ({{harvnb|Holley|King|2008}}). A number of studies report significant incidental vocabulary gain in extensive reading in a foreign language ({{harvnb|Huckin|Coady|1999}}). Advocates claim it can enhance skill in speaking as well as in reading.

{{harvnb|Day and Bamford (1988)|pp=7–8|Ref={{harvid|Day|Bamford|1988}}}} gave a number of traits common or basic to the extensive reading approach. Students read as much as possible. Reading materials are well within the reader's grammatical and vocabulary competence.  The material should be varied in subject matter and character.

Students choose their own reading material and are not compelled to finish uninteresting materials. Reading material is normally for pleasure, information or general understanding; reading is its own reward with few or no follow-up exercises after reading; reading is individual and silent.  Reading speed is usually faster when students read materials they can easily understand.

Nation(2005) suggests that learning from extensive reading should meet the following conditions: focusing on the meaning of the English text, understanding the type of learning that can occur through such reading, having interesting and engaging books, getting learners to do large quantities of reading at an appropriate level, and making sure that learning from reading is supported by other kinds of learning. In order to meet the conditions needed for learning from extensive reading at the students’ proficiency levels, it is essential to make use of simplified texts (Nation, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Nation, K. (2005). Children’s reading comprehension difficulties. In M. J. Snowling and C. Hulme (Eds.), The Science of Reading: A Handbook (pp 248–265).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eteachershub.com/2015/05/07/developing-china-students-english-reading-ability-through-extensive-reading/&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher is a role model who also orients the students to the goals of the program, explains the idea and methodology, keeps records of what has been read, and guides students in material selection and maximizing the effect of the program.

Some recent practitioners have not followed all of these traits, or have added to them, for example,  requiring regular follow-up exercises such as story summaries or discussions and the use of audio materials in tandem with the readings ({{harvnb|Bell|1998}}).

== Graded reader series ==
A [[graded reader]] series of books that increase in difficulty from shorter texts using more common words in the first volumes, to longer texts with less common vocabulary in later volumes. {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008}}}} cites Oxford's ''Bookworm series'', which includes the 2,500 most frequent words, The ''Longman Bridge Series'' (1945), with a systematic grading up to 8,000 words, now out of print, and the ''Penguin/Longman Active Reading'' series with its 3,000 word-family target.

Many series of graded readers exist in English, and series exist also in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Hill2008"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, readers are notably absent or scarce in Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese,&lt;ref name="Hill2008" /&gt; though since 2006, an extensive reader series is available in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/tadoku-english.html What is Extensive Reading?] {{en icon}} [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/ 日本語多読研究会] (Japanese Extensive Reading Research Society) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html 活動報告] (Report on Activities) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html#2006 2006] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; English readers have primarily been produced by British publishers, rather than American or other Anglophone nations. {{As of|1997}}, only one small series (15 volumes) was published in the United States, and a few in Europe outside the UK, with the majority in the UK.&lt;ref name="Hill1997"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation of modern literature ==
For advocates of extensive reading, lack of reading selection is an acute issue in [[classical language]]s such as [[Latin]] – the main readings available being quite difficult and are perceived as dry. To increase the available literature and make more light selection available, modern literature (particularly children's literature, comics, and genre fiction) may be translated into classical languages – see [[list of Latin translations of modern literature]] for examples in Latin. As [[Francis William Newman|F. W. Newman]] writes in his introduction to a Latin translation of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'':
:"[N]o accuracy of reading small portions of Latin will ever be so effective as extensive reading; and to make extensive reading possible to the many, the style ought to be very easy and the matter attractive."&lt;ref&gt;Francis William Newman, ''Rebilius Cruso: Robinson Crusoe, in Latin; A Book to Lighten Tedium to a Learner'', London, Trübner &amp; Co., 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threshold ==
Laufer suggests that 3,000 [[word family|word families]] or 5,000 lexical items are the threshold ({{harvnb|Laufer|1997|p= }}). Coady &amp; Nation (1998) suggest 98% of lexical coverage and 5,000 word families or 8,000 items for a pleasurable reading ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). After this threshold, the learner leaves the beginner paradox, and enters a [[virtuous circle]] ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). Then, extensive reading becomes more efficient.

== Limits ==
{{harvnb|Cobb (2007)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}}, {{harvnb|McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|McQuillan|Krashen|2008|p= }}}}, and {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} offer contrasting perspectives. All agree on the need of lexical input, but Cobb (2007; 2008) supported by {{harvnb|Parry (1997)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Parry|1997|p= }}}} denounces the sufficiency of extensive reading, the current lexical expansion pedagogy, especially for confirmed learners. According to Cobb (2007), {{harvnb|Krashen (1989)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Krashen|1989|p= }}}}'s Input Hypothesis states that extensive reading generates a continuous hidden learning (lexical input), eventually "doing the entire job" of vocabulary acquisition. This hypothesis is without empirical evidence, neither on the extent (% of global [[vocabulary acquisition]]), nor on the sufficiency of extensive reading for [[lexicon]] learning (Cobb 2007).

Cobb (2007) thus proposed a computer-based study to quantitatively assess the efficiency of extensive reading. Cobb estimated the reading quantity of common learners within the L2 language (~175,000 words over two years), then randomly took 10 words in each of the first thousand most frequent words, the second thousand, and the third thousand, to see how many times those words would appear. Those results should be higher than 6 to 10 encounters, the number needed for stable initial word learning to occur. Cobb (2007) summarizes as following: "[the quantitative study] shows the extreme unlikelihood of developing an adequate L2 reading lexicon [above 2,000 words families] through reading alone, even in highly favorable circumstances" since "for the vast majority of L2 learners, free or wide reading alone is not a sufficient source of vocabulary knowledge for reading". Thereafter, Cobb restated the need of lexical input, and stated the possibility to increase it using computing capabilities.

McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008) answer that learners may read far more than 175,000 words but rather +1,000,000 words in 2 years, but {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} counters that view as being based on excessively successful cases of reading oversimplified texts. Experiments cited by McQuillan &amp; Krashen use easy and fast to read texts, but not material suitable for discovering new vocabulary; unsimplified texts are far harder and slower to read.

== Advocacy and support organizations ==
The Extensive Reading Foundation is a not-for-profit, charitable organization whose purpose is to support and promote extensive reading. One of its initiatives is the annual Language Learner Literature Award for the best new works in English. Another is maintaining a bibliography of research on extensive reading. The Foundation is also interested in helping educational institutions set up extensive reading programs through grants that fund the purchase of books and other reading material.&lt;ref&gt;http://erfoundation.org/wordpress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Extensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG) of the Japan Association for Language Teaching &lt;ref&gt;[http://jalt.org/ Japan Association for Language Teaching (JALT)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a not-for-profit organization which exists to help promote Extensive Reading in Japan.  Via a website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/ xtensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG)]&lt;/ref&gt; the publications ''Extensive Reading in Japan'' and ''Journal of Extensive Reading'', presentations throughout Japan, and other activities, the ER SIG aims to help teachers set up and make the most of their ER programs and ER research projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensive listening ==
Similar to extensive reading is ''extensive listening'', which is the analogous approach to listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/el/starting_extensive_listening.htm Starting Extensive Listening], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/06/24/elt.ccq042.full The primacy of extensive listening], Meredith Stephens, {{doi|10.1093/elt/ccq042}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended – one may be able to read a text extensively, but not be able to listen to it extensively.

{{See also|Baroque painting}}

'''Flemish Baroque painting''' refers to the art produced in the [[Southern Netherlands]] during Spanish control in the 16th and 17th centuries. The period roughly begins when the [[Dutch Republic]] was split from the [[Habsburg Spain]] regions to the south with the Spanish recapturing of [[Antwerp]] in 1585 and goes until about 1700, when Habsburg authority ended with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1"&gt;Vleighe, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Antwerp, home to the prominent artists [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]], was the artistic nexus, while other notable cities include [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt;

Rubens, in particular, had a strong influence on seventeenth-century visual culture. His innovations helped define Antwerp as one of Europe's major artistic cities, especially for [[Counter Reformation]] imagery, and his student Van Dyck was instrumental in establishing new directions in English portraiture. Other developments in Flemish [[Baroque]] painting are similar to those found in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]],&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; with artists specializing in such areas as [[history painting]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[genre painting]], [[landscape painting]], and [[still life]].
{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}

==General characteristics==
"Flemish", in the context of this and artistic periods such as the "Flemish Primitives" (in English now [[Early Netherlandish painting]]), often includes the regions not associated with modern [[Flanders]], including the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the autonomous [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; By the seventeenth century, however, Antwerp was the main city for innovative artistic production, largely due to the presence of Rubens. Brussels was important as the location of the court, attracting [[David Teniers the Younger]] later in the century.

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Hogenberg, The Calvinist [[beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566]] when many paintings and church decorations were destroyed and subsequently replaced by late [[Northern Mannerist]] and Baroque artists.]]

===Late Mannerism===
Although paintings produced at the end of the 16th century belong to general [[Northern Mannerist]] and Late [[Renaissance]] approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as [[Otto van Veen]], [[Adam van Noort]], [[Marten de Vos]], and the [[Francken]] family were particularly instrumental in setting the stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new [[altarpiece]]s to replace those destroyed during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] [[beeldenstorm|outbreaks of 1566]]. Also during this time [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] became important for their small [[cabinet painting]]s, often depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] and history subjects.

==="The Age of Rubens"===
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640), a student of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied examples of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], and contemporaries [[Adam Elsheimer]] and [[Caravaggio]]. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. Most artists active in the city during the first half of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.

[[File:Rubens - Prometheus Bound.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peter Paul Rubens and Frans Snyders, ''Prometheus Bound'', 1611-12. Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting is Flemish Baroque example of collaboration and specialization. Snyders, who specialized in animals, painted the eagle while Rubens painted the figure of Prometheus.]]

===Specializations and collaborations===
Flemish art is notable for the large amount of collaboration that took place between independent masters, which was partly related to the local tendency to specialize in a particular area. [[Frans Snyders]], for example, was an animal painter and Jan Brueghel the Elder was admired for his landscapes and paintings of plants. Both artists worked with Rubens, who often usually painted the figures, and other artists to create collaborative pieces.

[[File:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Francken the Younger, ''Preziosenwand'' (''Wall of Treasures''), 1636. Kunsthistorischesmuseum, Vienna. This type of painting was one of the distinctly Flemish innovations that developed during the early 17th century.]]

===Innovations===
Flower [[still life]] painting, which developed around 1600 by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, was partially a Flemish innovation,&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 207–212.&lt;/ref&gt; echoed in the Dutch Republic in the works of the Antwerp-born [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]] (1573–1621).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, however, this new genre also developed into a specifically [[Catholic]] type of painting, the [[flower garland]]. Other types of paintings closely associated with Flemish Baroque include the monumental hunting scenes by Rubens and Snyders, and [[gallery paintings]] by artists such as [[Willem van Haecht]] and [[David Teniers the Younger]].

==History painting==
History painting, which includes biblical, mythological and historical subjects, was considered by seventeenth-century theoreticians as the most noble art. [[Abraham Janssens]] was an important history painter in Antwerp between 1600 and 1620, although after 1609 Rubens was the leading figure. Both Van Dyck and [[Jacob Jordaens]] were active painting monumental history scenes. Following Rubens's death, Jordaens became the most important Flemish painter. Other notable artists working in the idiom of Rubens include [[Gaspar de Crayer]], who was active in Brussels, [[Artus Wolffort]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Abraham van Diepenbeeck]], and [[Jan Boeckhorst]]. During the second half of the century, history painters combined a local influence from Rubens with knowledge of [[classicism]] and Italian [[Baroque]] qualities. Artists in the vein include [[Erasmus Quellinus the Younger]], [[Jan van den Hoecke]], [[Pieter van Lint]], [[Cornelis Schut]], and [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]]. Later in the century, many painters turned to Anthony van Dyck as a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Pieter Thijs]], [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]], and artists who were also inspired by Late Baroque theatricality such as [[Theodoor Boeyermans]] and [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]]. Additionally, a Flemish variant of ''[[Caravaggism]]'' was expressed by [[Theodoor Rombouts]] and [[Gerard Seghers]].

==Religious painting==
Rubens is closely associated with the development of the Baroque [[altarpiece]]. Painted for the Arquebusiers' [[guild]], the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' [[triptych]] (1611–14; [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]])—with side wings depicting the ''[[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]]'' and ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]]'', and exterior panels showing ''[[St. Christopher]] and the Hermit''—is an important reflection of Counter-Reformation ideas about art combined with Baroque naturalism, dynamism and monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger de Piles]] explains that "the painter has entered so fully into the expression of his subject that the sight of this work has the power to touch a hardened soul and cause it to experience the sufferings endured by Jesus Christ in order to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Baroque'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anthony van Dyck, ''Portrait of King Charles I'', 1635. Louvre, Paris.]]

==Portraiture==
Although not predominately a portrait painter, Rubens's contributions include early works such as his ''Portrait of Brigida Spinola-Doria'' (1606, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]), paintings of his wives (the ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and ''[[Het Pelsken]]''), and numerous portraits of friends and nobility. He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student [[Anthony van Dyck]]. Van Dyck became court painter for [[Charles I of England]] and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Although most Flemish portraiture is life-sized or monumental, [[Gonzales Coques]] and [[Gillis van Tilborch]] specialized in small-scale group portraiture.
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Drink'', ''c''. 1630–1640. Brouwer's expressive peasants are typical of "low-life" genre painting.]]

==Genre painting==
[[Genre painting]]s, or scenes of everyday life, are common in the 17th century. Many artists follow the tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in depicting "low-life" peasant themes, although elegant "high-life" subjects featuring fashionably-dressed couples at [[Ball (dance)|balls]] or in gardens of love are also common. [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose small paintings often show peasants fighting and drinking, was particularly influential on subsequent artists. Images of woman performing household tasks, popularized in the northern Netherlands by [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Jan Vermeer]], is not a significant subject in the south, although artists such as [[Jan Siberechts]] explored these themes to some degree.

===Bruegel tradition===
Flemish genre painting is strongly tied to the traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]. Many of these are [[Kermesse (festival)|kermis]] paintings and scenes of peasants taking part in other outdoor enjoyments viewed from an elevated viewpoint. Artists in the Dutch Republic, such as the Flemish-born [[David Vinckboons]] and [[Roelandt Savery]], also made similar works, popularizing rustic scenes of everyday life closely associated with Dutch and Flemish painting.

===Adriaen Brouwer and his followers===
[[Adriaen Brouwer]] (1605 or 1606–1638) typically painted small scenes of ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour. Born in the Southern Netherlands, Brouwer spent the 1620s in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]], where he came under the influence of [[Frans Hals|Frans]] and [[Dirk Hals]] and other artists working in a loose [[painterly]] manner. Upon his return to Antwerp around 1631 or 1632 he introduced a new, influential format in which the subjects were painted as interior, instead of exterior, scenes. He also painted expressive facial studies like ''The Bitter Drink'' (illustrated), a genre called [[tronie]]s ("faces"). Brouwer's art was recognized in his own lifetime and had a powerful impact on Flemish art. Rubens owned more works by him at the time of his death than any other painter, and artists such as [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Jan van de Venne]], [[Joos van Craesbeeck]] and [[David Ryckaert III]] continued to work in a similar manner.

===Elegant company scenes===
Paintings of elegant couples in the latest fashions, often with underlying themes of love or the [[sense|five senses]], were commonly painted by [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]], [[Louis de Caullery]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[David Teniers the Younger]] and [[David Ryckaert III]]. Rubens's ''Garden of Love'' (''c''. 1634–5; [[Prado Museum]]) belongs to these traditions.

===Monumental genre scenes===
Whereas elegant company scenes and works by Brouwer and his followers were often small in scale, other artists looked to [[Caravaggio]] for inspiration and painted large-scale, theatrically inspired scenes in which musicians, cardplayers, and fortune tellers are pushed to the foreground of the composition. These paintings, like others by ''[[Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]]'', are generally illuminated by strong lighting effects. [[Adam de Coster]], [[Gerard Seghers]] and [[Theodoor Rombouts]] were the main exponents of this popular style in the early 17th century, which was popularized by Italian followers of Caravaggio like [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]. Rombouts was also influenced by his teacher [[Abraham Janssens]], who began incorporating Caravaggesque influences into his history paintings from first decade of the 17th century

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Jordaens, ''The King Drinks''. Jordeans was well known for his large paintings of moralistic genre scenes, such as this depiction of an [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] feast.]]

===Jacob Jordaens===
Jacob Jordaens, who became Antwerp's most important artist after Rubens's death in 1640, is well known for his monumental genre paintings of subjects such as ''The King Drinks'' and ''As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young''. Many of these paintings use compositional and lighting influences similar to those of the ''Caravaggisti'', while the treatment of the subjects inspired Dutch artists like [[Jan Steen]].

===Battle scenes===
Another popular type of painting invented in the [[Low Countries]] was landscapes with historical and fictional battles, as well as skirmishes and robberies. [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and his pupil [[Peter Snayers]] specialized in this genre, and Snayer's student [[Adam-Frans van der Meulen]] continued painting them in Antwerp, Brussels and [[Paris]] until the end of the century.

===Bamboccianti===
Following a time-honoured tradition, many northern artists travelled to Italy in the 17th century. Flemish artists such as [[Jan Miel]] (1599–1664), [[Michael Sweerts]] (1618–1664), [[Anton Goubau]] (1616–1698) and [[Willem Reuter]] (c.1642–1681) went to Rome where they worked for a period of time.  Here they were influenced by the works of the [[Genre works|genre painters]] active in Rome referred to as the [[Bamboccianti]].  The Bamboccianti comprised mostly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flemings|Flemish]] artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|sixteenth-century Netherlandish art]] with them to Italy,&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levine, David A. (December 1988). "The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti". The Art Bulletin. College Art Association. 70 (4), p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; and generally created small [[cabinet painting]]s or [[etching]]s of the [[everyday life]] of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;Haskell, Francis (1993). "Chapter 8". Patrons and Painters: Art and Society in Baroque Italy. Yale University Press, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] who was nicknamed  "Il Bamboccio" (meaning "ugly doll" or "puppet" in Italian) had started this type of genre painting in Rome.  In general, genre painting was not well-accepted in Italy, especially by official organizations such as the [[Academy of St. Luke]].  Many of the painters were alsom members of the [[Bentvueghels]], the society of mainly Flemish and Dutch artists working in Rome. It acted as a support network for Netherlandish artists in Rome who were in need but is better-known for the "[[bohemian]]" lifestyle of its members and drunken festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David A., "The Bentvueghels: 'Bande Académique"," in IL60: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. New York: Italica Press, 1990, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape and seascape==

===Early landscape painting===
[[Gillis van Coninxloo]] was an innovative landscape painter in Antwerp in the late 16th century, who introduced a more natural view instead of the traditional [[world landscape]] popularized by earlier painters such as [[Joachim Patiner]]. He left a strong influence on northern landscape painting in general through his period in [[Amsterdam]] and as a founding member of the [[Frankenthal School]]. Forest and mountain landscapes were painted by [[Abraham Govaerts]], [[Alexander Keirincx]], [[Gijsbrecht Leytens]], [[Tobias Verhaecht]] and [[Joos de Momper]]. [[Paul Bril]] settled in Rome, where he specialized as a landscape painter decorating Roman villas and creating small [[cabinet painting]]s.
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Landscape with view of 'Het Steen''', 1636.]]

===Rubens and later painters===
[[Jan Wildens]] and [[Lucas van Uden]] painted natural landscapes inspired by Rubens, and frequently collaborated with figure painters or animal specialists to paint the backgrounds. Rubens turned to landscape painting in the 1630s, focusing on the area around his chateau, Het Steen. A well-known example is the ''Landscape with a view of 'Het Steen''' ([[National Gallery of London]]).

===Marine painting===
Small seascapes (''zeekens'') were another popular theme. Artists such as [[Bonaventura Peeters]] painted shipwrecks and atmospheric views of ships at sea, as well as imaginary views of exotic ports. [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], who was from [[Rotterdam]] and settled in Antwerp, continued this latter theme contemporaneous with developments of [[marine painting]] in the Dutch Republic.

==Architectural painting==
{{main|Architectural painting}}
Interior architectural views, usually of churches, developed out of the late sixteenth-century works of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Many were actual locations. [[Pieter Neeffs I]], for example, made numerous interiors of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]]. [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]], on the other hand, followed Vredeman's precedent in painting imaginary interiors. The genre continued in the later seventeenth century by [[Anton Ghering]] and [[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]], but the Flemish examples do not demonstrate the same level of innovation found in the Dutch perspectives of [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]] or [[Emanuel de Witte]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe200"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DAVID TENIERS EL JOVEN - El Archiduque Leopoldo Guillermo en su Galería de Bruselas (Kunsthistorisches Museum de Viena, 1650-52.

Teniers documented the archduke's collection of paintings in this work while he was court painter in Brussels.]]

==Gallery and art collection painting==
Gallery paintings appeared in Antwerp around 1610, and developed—like architectural interiors—from the compositions of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest innovators of this new genre was [[Frans Francken the Younger]], who introduced the type of work known as the ''Preziosenwand'' (wall of treasures). In these, prints, paintings, sculptures, drawings, as well as collectable objects from the natural world like shells and flowers are collected together in the foreground against a wall that imitates encyclopedic [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. A similar variation of these collections of artistic wealth are the series of the [[sense|five senses]] created by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and Rubens ([[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]). [[Willem van Haecht]] (1593–1637) developed another variation in which illustrations of actual artworks are displayed in a fantasy art gallery, while connoisseurs and art lovers admire them. Later in the century, [[David Teniers the Younger]], working in the capacity of court painter to [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], documented the archduke's collection of Italian paintings in Brussels as gallery painters as well as in a printed catalogue–the ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''. Flemish Gallery and art collection paintings have been interpreted as a kind of visual theory of art.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paintings continued to be made in Antwerp by [[Gerard Thomas]] (1663–1721) and [[Balthasar van den Bossche]] (1681–1715), and foreshadow the development of the [[veduta]] in Italy and the galleries of [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]].

==Still life and animal painting==

===Flower painting===
[[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] was one of the important innovators of the floral still life around 1600.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"/&gt; These paintings, which presented immaculately observed arrangements and compositions, were imaginary creations of  flowers that bloom at different times of the years.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207" /&gt; They were popular with leading patrons and nobility across Europe, and generally have an underlying [[Vanitas]] motif. The compositions of Brueghel's paintings were also influential on later Dutch flower pieces.&lt;ref name="vlieghe208"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's sons [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Ambrosius Brueghel]] were also flower specialists. [[Osias Beert]] (1580–1624) was another flower painter at the beginning of the 17th century. His paintings share many similarities with northern contemporaries such as [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe208" /&gt;

===Garland painting===
Closely related to the flower still life is the flower garland genre of painting that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Federico Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]) show the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the delicacy of the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] outbreaks of 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg (1981), ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's student, the [[Jesuit]] painter [[Daniel Seghers]], also painted many of these types of works for an international clientele.&lt;ref name="vlieghe209"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.
[[File:Osias Beert - Oysters 1610.jpg|thumb|right|Osias Beert, ''Still life with oysters'', ''c''. 1610. Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart. Beert's still lifes are typical of the "breakfast" type painted early in the 17th century.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;]]

===Breakfast and banquet still life===
The ''ontbijtje'', or "little breakfast", is a type of still life that was popular in both the northern and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a neutral background. [[Osias Beert]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Cornelis Mahu]] and [[Jacob Foppens van Es]] (''c''. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the ''pronk'', or "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to [[vanitas]] and transience motifs.

[[File:Frans SNYDERS, The Pantry.JPG|thumb|left|Frans Snyders, ''The Pantry'', ''c''. 1620.]]

===Animal still life===
[[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657) painted large still lifes focusing on dead game and animals. His compositions, along with those of his follower [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] (1599–1652). look back to the sixteenth-century paintings of [[Pieter Aertsen]] and [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], but instill that tradition with a High Baroque monumentality.&lt;ref name="vlieghe211"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent artists, [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Pieter Boel]] further elaborated on this type by including a noticeable mixture of living animals and dead game. These latter paintings are closely related to images of the hunt, which came into fashion in Flemish painting during the 17th century.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 110.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Tiger and Lion Hunt'', ''c''. 1617–1618. Musée des Beaux Arts, Rennes. This painting is typical of Rubens's "exotic" hunts painted between about 1615 and 1625.]]

==Hunting scenes==
Rubens introduced the monumental hunt to Flemish art, depicting on a large scale a close battle inspired by his study of classical antiquity and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]''. These works show both noble hunts, such as the ''Wolf and Fox Hunt'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), and exotic hunts, such as the ''Lion Hunt'' ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]). [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Paul de Vos]] created similarly large paintings which are 
distinct from Rubens's works in their focus on the animals and absence of human participation.

==Cabinet painting==
Small, intricate paintings, usually depicting history and biblical subjects, were produced in great numbers in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Hendrik van Balen]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Hendrik de Clerck]] were all successful [[cabinet painting|cabinet painters]] during the first half of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of [[Adam Elsheimer]] like [[David Teniers the Elder]], remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are [[Frans Wouters]], [[Jan Thomas van Ieperen]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[Pieter van Lint]], and [[Willem van Herp]]. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geographic names board''' is an official body established by a government to decide on official names for geographical areas and features.

Most countries have such a body, which is commonly (but not always) known under this name. Also, in some countries (especially those organised on a federal basis), subdivisions such as individual states or provinces will have individual boards.

'''Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics''', commonly known as '''Gokhale Institute''', is one of the oldest research and training institutes in [[Economics]] in [[India]]. The Institute publishes a quarterly journal of economics in English, [[Artha Vijnana]], the first publication of which was made in March 1959.
The [[Kale Memorial Lecture]], organised by the Institute every year on the occasion of the Founder's Day, is published under the Kale Memorial Lecture Series. Over 70 lectures have been delivered under this Lecture Series, and the list of speakers includes such prominent figures as: [[B R Ambedkar]], [[John Mathai]], [[P C Mahalanobis]], [[V.K.R.V. Rao]], [[K N Raj]], [[V M Dandekar]], [[I G Patel]], [[Andre Beteille]], [[Manmohan Singh]], [[Amresh Bagchi]], [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], [[C Rangarajan]], [[A P J Abdul Kalam]] and [[Raghuram Rajan]].

==History==
The Institute was founded on 6 June 1930 by R. R. Kale as a centre for research and higher learning in economics. The Institute was founded with an endowment offered to the [[Servants of India Society]] by Shri R R Kale. The Servants of India Society, a registered body founded by the nationalist leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], are the trustees of the Institute. The Institute is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950.

The Institute was set up with an objective to conduct research on the economic and political problems of India and to train research workers in these disciplines. [[D. R. Gadgil]] was the first Director of the Institute.

==Research==
[[File:Gokhale Institute of Politics ^ Economics (Entrance) - panoramio.jpg|thumb]]
The major research areas of the Institute, developed over the years through financial assistance from various sources, are: [[Agricultural Economics]], [[Population Studies]], [[Economic History]], [[Input-output analysis]] for planning and development, [[Microeconomics]], [[Macroeconomics]], [[Monetary economics]], [[Financial Economics]], [[Public Economics]], [[International Economics]] and the study of economics of East European countries.

In the early years, the research activities were financed through assistance from various ministries and public funding agencies including the [[Government of Maharashtra]] and private foundations like the [[Sir Dorabji Tata Trust]]. In 1954, the Union Ministry of Food and Agriculture established the Agro-Economic Research Centre of the Institute. During the early fifties, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] made a substantial grant, spread over years, for the conduct of a research programme in rural [[demography]]. The Union Ministry of Health also gave grants for conducting some specific demographic studies in 1954-57; and in 1964, the Ministry decided to strengthen and expand the research work on population by financing on a continuing basis a Population Research Centre as an integral part of the Institute. [[Ford Foundation]] gave a very generous financial assistance for more than a decade beginning with the year 1956. Later on, the Ford Foundation, in co-operation with the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], provided a separate grant for research and training in the areas of planning and development, mainly devoted to input-output studies. In 1962, the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] recognised the Institute as a Centre of Advanced Study in Agricultural Economics to start with and later, in 1964, as a Centre of Advanced Study in Economics. In 1977, the UGC, as a part of its Area Studies Programme, established at the Institute a Centre of Study of Economics of East European Countries. In the same year, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] instituted a Chair in Finance at the Institute.

==Teaching==
Although GIPE was primarily a research institute, it was recognized as an institution for higher learning in the field of economics, and it awarded [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[MPhil]] and [[PhD]] degrees in Economics under recognition from the [[University of Bombay]] from 1930 to 1949. With the establishment of the [[University of Pune]] in 1949, GIPE became a constituent recognized institution of the University of Pune until 1993. Keeping in view its professional standing and scope for further development, the [[Government of India]], on recommendation of the University Grants Commission, declared GIPE as ‘[[Deemed University]]’ from 9 May 1993.

==Academic Programmes==
The goal of the Institute —to conduct research into the Economic and Political problems of India and train research workers in these subjects— has been reconceptualised over years so as to confine the activities of the Institute to teaching and research in Economics alone, leaving aside the political problems of India. However, the applied and empirical research into Indian economic problems and policy evaluations indirectly encompass the political dimensions as well.

The curricular content of the ongoing MSc Economics Programme offers a blend of core and applied optional courses. The number of subjects per course have been increased from 16 in the MA Programme to 20 in the ongoing MSc Programme so as to make the courses more rigorous. The student-faculty ratio is 3:1 for the MSc Programme.

=== Ph.D. Programme ===
The PhD Programme, started right from the inception of the Institute, still continues with a highly selective intake and hence a limited output. More than 165 students have obtained their doctoral degrees in different branches of Economics since the inception of the Institute.

=== M.Sc. Programmes ===
GIPE offers nationally recognised two-year M.Sc. Programmes in Economics, Financial Economics, AgriBusiness Economics and International Business Economics &amp; Finance. Students for each of these Programmes are selected through a rigorous nationwide entrance exam that test their analytical, reasoning and quantitative skills. The courses offered at GIPE are unique in a sense that they blend crucial theories and their practical applications helping the students to get industry ready. Details of the courses are as follows:

==== M.Sc. (Economics) ====
The programme is designed to develop among the students a strong, broad-based academic foundation in economic theory and its application, as well as excellent transferable skills that enhance their professional prospects in the banking, finance and business analytics sectors, corporate organizations, government and non-government establishments and regulatory agencies, national and international development agencies.

==== M.Sc. (Financial Economics) ====
The master's degree programme in Financial Economics is distinct from the conventional [[finance]] programmes, notably on account of its emphasis on the three-way linkage between [[macroeconomics]], financial markets and financial regulations. Inputs in quantitative finance in the form of compulsory courses in Financial Economics, Computational Finance and Financial Engineering are important highlights of the programme. In addition, the programme provides for full length courses on Project Appraisal &amp; Finance, Structural Products, M&amp;A, and Investment Banking among others.

==== M.Sc. (Agribusiness Economics) ====
The M.Sc. Agribusiness Economics program prepares students for careers in the agribusiness sector, both as officers in agribusiness organizations, and as economists in agribusiness related research organizations. The academic content of the program has three major modules: an economics module, a management module, and an agribusiness module. The economics module equips students with the core economics principles as well as the advanced quantitative techniques that are the basic tools used to analyze questions of business and policy. The agribusiness module complements these tools with a broad grasp of the current theory, data, and issues (both business as well as policy) surrounding the agribusiness sector in India. The management module provides students with an overview of essential managerial skills such as accounting, finance, marketing, supply chain management, risk management, and insurance.

==== M.Sc. (International Business Economics &amp; Finance) ====
This new programme to be offered from the academic year 2016-17 is a unique course designed for careers in international trade, foreign portfolio investment, foreign direct investment, international technical/financial collaboration and joint ventures, international finance and portfolio management, etc. 
 
The current intake for each programme is 60 students. The Institute also offers a Certificate Course on Computer Applications in Economic Analysis.

==Publications==
The Institute publishes a quarterly journal of economics in English, [[Artha Vijnana]], the first publication of which was made in March 1959. This journal publishes results of research work carried out in the Institute as well as works of scholars from outside the Institute after a refereeing process. The Institute also publishes research works in the form of books and mimeograph series. The [[Kale Memorial Lecture]], organised by the Institute every year on the occasion of the Founder's Day, is published under the Kale Memorial Lecture Series. Over 70 lectures have been delivered under this Lecture Series, and the list of speakers includes such prominent figures as: [[B R Ambedkar]], [[John Mathai]], [[P C Mahalanobis]], [[V.K.R.V. Rao]], [[K N Raj]], [[V M Dandekar]], [[I G Patel]], [[Andre Beteille]], [[Manmohan Singh]], [[Amresh Bagchi]], [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], [[C Rangarajan]] and [[A P J Abdul Kalam]]. All the Kale Memorial Lectures delivered at the Gokhale Institute are published, and most of the Lectures' Text can be found on [[JSTOR]] (Journal Storage - an online archive for academic journals made available to researchers through participating libraries and institutions).

==Campus==
[[File:Gokhale Institute near Hanuman Tekdi - panoramio.jpg|thumb]]
The Institute has a serene and beautiful campus of {{convert|5.25|acre|m2}} and is located in the urban setting of [[Pune]] in Deccan Gymkhana area. The residential campus of the Institute comprising faculty and staff houses, guest houses, and the student dormitories, is built on a separate plot of {{convert|5.39|acre|m2}}, a few metres away from the Institute. There are two hostels, one for boys and another for girls. Adequate hostel accommodation is available for the existing students. The girls’ hostel was designed by the famous architect and urban planner [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] during 1996-1998.

The Institute campus is a mélange of old and new buildings spread over a large and lush green area. It provides just the right sylvan, solitary and peaceful setting required for learning and researching. After having undergone a recent landscaping, the campus attracts many a visitors as well. The campus consists of an academic block, faculty block, administration block, seminar hall and the Dhananjaya Rao Gadgil Library. There is a conference hall, known as Kale Memorial Hall, on the top floor of the Library which is used by the Institute and also let out to others on rent. The austere and majestic buildings radiate the old charm characteristic of the [[Pune]] city. On the Fergusson Hill behind the Institute lies the spot where Gokhale took the vows of the Servants of India Society – poverty, obedience, and service to nation - and administered them to three others. It has become a landmark because of the erection of a column there. Gokhale’s bungalow still stands in the precincts of the campus. A massive and graceful [[banyan tree]] adds to the charm of the place. This is said to be the tree under which [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (who regarded Gokhale as his political guru) used to muse over political issues in their times. The residential campus of the GIPE too, is set in the midst of lush greenery and gives the place a uniquely quaint contour, especially in the rains.

==Library==
The Dhananjaya Rao Gadgil Library is a [[depository library]] of the publications of the [[United Nations]] and its agencies, the [[World Bank]], the [[European Economic Community]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[Government of Canada]]. The Library possesses quite a large number of rare books published before the advent of twentieth century and which may not be available elsewhere. The oldest book in the Library dates back to 1680. Besides, there are quite a few hundred books which were published during the 18th and 19th centuries.

'''Kenneth "Harry" Oldmeadow''' is an [[Australia]]n academic, [[author]], [[editing|editor]] and [[educator]] whose works focus on [[religion]], [[tradition]], [[Traditionalist School|traditionalist writers]] and [[philosophy]].

==Life and career==

Oldmeadow was born in [[Melbourne]] in 1947. His parents were [[Christian]] [[missionaries]] in [[India]] and he spent the first nine years of his childhood there and developed an early interest in the civilisations of the East.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.editions-hozhoni.com/contributeurs/harry-oldmeadow/ Éditions Hozoni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow studied history, politics and literature at the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Sydney]], as well as working as a history tutor at [[La Trobe University]] in [[Melbourne]]. In 1971 a Commonwealth Overseas Research Scholarship allowed him to study at [[Oxford University]], followed by extensive travel in Europe and North Africa.&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"/&gt;

In 1980 he achieved a [[master's degree]] in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of Sydney]] where he completed a dissertation on the work of [[Frithjof Schuon]] and the other principal [[tradition]]alist writers.&lt;ref&gt; (fr) [http://www.almora.fr/auteur/harry-oldmeadow.html Almora auteur]&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was awarded the University of Sydney Medal for excellence in research and was eventually published by the [[Sri Lanka]] Institute of Traditional Studies under the title ''Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy'' (Colombo, 2000).&lt;ref name = "WWauthors"&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Harry-Oldmeadow.aspx World Wisdom]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the auspices of this institute, Oldmeadow delivered the Inaugural [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] Memorial Lecture in [[Colombo]] on ''The Religious Tradition of the Australian Aborigines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=Lalita |date=2008 |title= Unveiling the Garden of Love: Mystical Symbolism |url= https://books.google.fr/books?id=z3Z3Lg1sUOMC&amp;pg=PA209 |location= |publisher=World Wisdom |page=209 |isbn= 9781933316635 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/some-puzzles-and-conundrums-in-the-teaching-of-religion-audio-lecture-11020410 Tes, Puzzles and conandrums in the teaching of religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/Oldmeadow/MelodiesE.pdf Religio perennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oldmeadow was the Co-ordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at [[La Trobe University]], Bendigo. He has published extensively in such journals as ''Sacred Web'' (Vancouver), ''Sophia'' (Washington DC) and ''Asian Philosophy'' (Nottingham, UK). In late 2001, he was a key speaker at a large interfaith gathering in Sydney organised by the [[Australian Centre for Sufism]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiansuficentre.org/events.htm Australian Sufi Center]&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of the meeting was the need for interreligious understanding in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]].

'''Helena Trafford Devereux''' (February 2, 1885 – November 17, 1975) is an American [[educator]] who founded the [[Devereux Foundation]].  She is considered a pioneer in the field of [[special education]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R. Reynolds &amp; E. Fletcher-Janzen, E., Concise encyclopedia of special education: a reference for the education of the handicapped and other exceptional children and adults ( John Wiley and Sons, 2004), 310, https://books.google.com/books?id=u4uzPlgcWpsC&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;ots=XhW9b3d_wb&amp;dq=special%20education%20helena%20devereux&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=special%20education%20helena%20devereux&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Devereux began the first Devereux School for Exceptional Children in her home with less than $100. Today, more than 6,000 Devereux staff provides services to tens of thousands of children, adolescents, adults, and their families in 11 states and millions more across the country through [[public education]] and prevention programs each year.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"&gt;Edward Dinger, ed., International Directory of Company Histories (Detroit: St. James Press, 2011), 134-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Devereux graduated from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]] in 1904 and from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls|Philadelphia Normal School for Girls]] in 1906 where she trained to become a teacher.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;J.B. Post, “Devereux in Easttown and Tredyffrin Townships,” Tredyffrin Easttown Historical Society’s History Quarterly 41 (2004):131-134, {{cite web |url=http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/pdf/v41/Volume41_N4_131.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714204705/http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/pdf/v41/Volume41_N4_131.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation she began teaching in one of Philadelphia’s most underprivileged communities, at the [[Vare-Washington School|George Washington School]] in [[South Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;

At a time when very little was known or understood about people with disabilities, Devereux took an interest in “slow learning” children. She recognized early that the public school system was ill-equipped to teach children with mental handicaps. Her intuitive ideas in developing individualized educational programs for children with special needs were far beyond her time.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;  While the system had typically referred to slow learners as “throw-aways” Devereux believed that every child should be given opportunities to learn and achieve personal accomplishments. She believed that special educators are missionaries at heart.&lt;ref&gt;Harry N. Chandler, “Some Summer Homework,” Journal of Learning Disabilities, 16:5 (1983): 306-307.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, her class became the de facto special education classroom.

In 1911, Devereux was offered the job of Director of Special Education by the [[School District of Philadelphia|Philadelphia Board of Education]], a new position designed to supervise the creation of a special education department. Despite being offered a handsome salary for the time, she turned it down, believing that she could have a greater impact branching off on her own.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;

Also in 1911, Devereux received national attention following a visit to her classroom from a reporter. Shortly thereafter, “The First Class of Special Education in an Elementary School in Philadelphia” was published.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; Following the publication about her teaching methods, Devereux was contacted by a parent in [[South Carolina]], interested in entrusting her challenged son to Devereux’s care. For $200, Devereux agreed to assume responsibility for the boy during the summer. The child, Robert Simpson, would become Devereux’s first private school student.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"&gt;David Brind, Reaching the Mind, Touching the Spirit, 2011, http://www.devereux.org/site/DocServer/HTDBio.pdf?docID=281.&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, Devereux also received similar offers from other parents of children with special needs. In the summer of 1911, Devereux rented at six-bedroom home in [[Avalon, New Jersey]] in order to teach and care for eight children.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;

==Devereux Schools: The Beginning==
In 1912 several children continued to live with Devereux in her own home in Philadelphia, which became her first private school.  This marked the beginning of The Devereux Foundation. During that time, Devereux remained a public school teacher, and employed two assistant teachers to teach and look after students during the day.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;

Devereux devoted herself to learning how to best serve her students. Between the years of 1910 and 1918, Devereux participated in several post graduate endeavors, including the study of [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[speech therapy]] at colleges and universities in the Philadelphia area.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;  She also took apprenticeship training in the areas of [[occupational therapy]], woodworking and handicrafts.  All her efforts focused on improving the education and experience of the students in her charge. In 1914 she began working for the Philadelphia Normal School in order to teach post graduate students in the country’s first course on special education.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;

In 1918, she resigned from the Normal school to teach her private school students full-time. In January 1918 she used $94 of saved and borrowed funds in order to rent a house in [[Devon, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;

==Organizational Growth==
May 1, 1918 Helena Devereux and her students took residence in the house that became known as “Devereux Stone.”  Soon her students numbered 12, and in 1919 Devereux was able to purchase the rental property, as well as the neighboring estate.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;   Over the course of two years, school enrollment doubled.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;   In 1920 Devereux purchased another property in [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania]] in order to provide a home to some of the younger [[developmentally disabled]] children in her care. From 1920 onward, the organization saw continued growth, both in enrollment numbers, as well as in properties purchased.

In 1922, the different schools and facilities became united under one name—Devereux Schools.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;  Despite an operating deficit of $250,000 during the [[Great Depression]], Devereux continued to acquire real estate throughout the Philadelphia area. Creditors were kept at bay through the shared burden of Devereux staff, and loans from the parents of Devereux’s students.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;

In 1938 The [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] granted The Devereux Foundation its non-profit charter.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Post, “Devereux in Easttown and Tredyffrin Townships,” Tredyffrin Easttown Historical Society’s History Quarterly 41 (2004):131-134, {{cite web |url=http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/pdf/v41/Volume41_N4_131.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714204705/http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/pdf/v41/Volume41_N4_131.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Devereux transferred all the assets and properties of Devereux Schools to the Foundation.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;  In 1943 The Devereux Foundation expanded tremendously, purchasing another building in Devon as well as a 350-acre estate in [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;  She would continue to serve actively as a consultant.

The Foundation continued to expand in the 1950s and 1960s, opening branches in Texas, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Arizona. In 1955 Devereux began professional training and research partnerships with several universities including the Teachers College of [[Columbia University,]] [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Bryn Mawr College]] School of Social Work, among others.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;   1957 saw the introduction of the Devereux Institute for Research and Training, an initiative to expand professional training and research into the causes and treatment of certain psychological problems in children.&lt;ref name="Edward Dinger 2011"/&gt;

In 1957, Devereux resigned as director of the Foundation.

==Professional Acknowledgments==
In 1958 Devereux became the first non-medical person, and only the fourth woman to become an honorary member of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;“Obituary: Helena Devereux,” The Washington Post, November 20, 1975, B18.&lt;/ref&gt;   Devereux’s only published paper was published in 1909 in The Psychological Clinic entitled, “Report of a Year’s Work on Defectives in a Public School.”&lt;ref&gt;Helena Devereux, “Report of a Year’s Work on Defectives in a Public School,” The Psychological Clinic 3 (1909):45-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1924, Devereux married James Fentress, a widower of one of her friends.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;  She continued to be called Miss Devereux. Married 21 years, they maintained very private personal lives, despite collaborating in the affairs of the organization. A strong supporter of his wife’s independence and presence as the President of Devereux, Fentress served as the organization’s Vice President, overseeing finances as the organization grew in size and scope.&lt;ref name="devereux.org"/&gt;

Fentress died in 1943 and Devereux never remarried. Her family life in Pennsylvania centered on her brother, Robert’s, children Mary Helena Devereux Scott and Richard Blyton Devereux, M.D.

Devereux died November 17, 1975, at her home in Devon at age 90.&lt;ref&gt;“Obituary: Helena Devereux,” The Washington Post, November 20, 1975, B18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical behaviour studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung)''' is a field of research in cultural history and cultural anthropology and a particular methodological approach to the study of human behaviour.

== Method and object of research ==

Historical behaviour studies are a type of [[cultural sociology]] under the particular aspect of historical change. Its focal points were:

* to describe [[patterns]] of human bodily practice as [[rites]] and ceremonies, music and dance, sports and exercises, play and game, beyond ideas and [[weltanschauung]] [[:de:Weltanschauung]];
* to identify analogies between [[patterns]] of bodily [[behaviour]], ([[gestures]] and body movement) and patterns of [[thinking]] (“Denkordnungen”);
* to compare forms of behaviour across different times and [[cultures]] by [[patterns]] and [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] rather than by meaning;
* to compare patterns of behaviour, of thinking and of mentalities (mindsets) in different fields of society, as in economic behaviour, military behaviour, concepts of [[natural sciences]], proceedings and atmospheres in literary works, and [[social movements]];
* to understand epochal changes of behaviour (→[[Periodization]]);
* to bridge the gap between history, [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].

== Institute of Social Research – the Stuttgart school ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung) were established in 1971 by August Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] and [[Henning Eichberg]] as a department of the [[University of Stuttgart]]. The Department of Historical Behaviour Studies was part of the newly established Institute of Social Research, side by side with departments of [[social planning]] and [[social economy]]. Later on, historians like Johannes Burkhardt [[:de:Johannes Burkhardt]], [[Andreas Kalckhoff]], Harald Kleinschmidt, Volker Saftien and Michael Walter joined the department. Others like Wolfgang Christian Schneider, Andreas Gestrich [[:de:Andreas Gestrich]], Mathias Beer und Katja Erdmann-Rajski worked in connection with the department and used similar methods of research.

The research of this Stuttgart school of studies in [[human behaviour]] was to a certain extent parallel to the [[History of Mentalities]] from France, to the Cultural Sociology (Kultursoziologie [[:de:Kultursoziologie]]) from Germany and Denmark, and to the [[Historical Anthropology]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' from Germany which arose in the 1990s. Referring to [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Norbert Elias]] and [[Michel Foucault]], the patterns of human behaviour were called “[[wikt:configuration|configurations]]” (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]).

== Analyzing historical change and cultural difference ==

The Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies directed special attention towards fundamental and abrupt changes of behavior and society, as they could be observed in the context of the [[Renaissance]] 1550–1650, of the [[Industrial Revolution]] around 1770–1820, and in cultural change around 1900–1930. Other changes were studied for the [[Middle Ages]]. These historical [[case studies]] could lead to questions concerning the significance and change of behaviour at present and in the future.

A particular characteristic of the Stuttgart studies of historical behaviour was the comparative turn towards non-Western societies like [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[China]].

While the Stuttgart school generally focused on “describing” (→[[description]]) and “[[understanding]]” different forms and changes of historical behaviour, the “[[explanation]]” of [[cultural difference]] and change was discussed diversely. Eichberg emphasized the irreducible [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness ([[alterity]]) of foreign behavior; “extraneous” patterns withdraw from the explanations of the external observer and develop, also in modernity, on ways quite different from Western standard. Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] tried to find explanations for the historical dynamics of different [[cultures]] by models of [[energy]] and [[time]] expectation; this met with observations of [[self-organization]] (→[[Synergetics (Haken)]]) as reported in [[physics]] and [[biology]]. Common for the Stuttgart school was a skeptical distance towards the traditional explanation of historical change by [[ideologies]], individual [[intention]]s, general [[social structures]] or one global process of [[sociocultural evolution]].

== Influence on international research ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies contributed among others to the history of [[popular culture]], and of [[peace]] and [[war]], to the study of [[paradigm]] changes in [[natural sciences]], to the [[history of art]] and of the [[public sphere]]. They had a special impact on the international study of body culture ([[physical culture]]). The Danish school of body culture studies developed the analysis of [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] – social space, social time, inter-human relations, atmospheres and emotions, and the objectifying of [[:wikt:movement|movement]] – towards the study of [[sport]] and other movement cultures (p. e. [[musical gesture]]) in diverse societies and social formations.

The term [[isomorphism]] literally means sameness (iso) of form (morphism). In [[Gestalt psychology]], Isomorphism is the idea that perception and the underlying physiological representation are similar because of related Gestalt qualities. Isomorphism refers to a correspondence between a stimulus array and the brain state created by that stimulus, and is based on the idea that the objective brain processes underlying and correlated with particular phenomenological experiences functionally have the same form and structure as those subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Wertheimer|Wertheimer, M.]] 2010. Isomorphism. Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, W. (1920/1955). Die physischen Gestalten in Ruhe und im stationaren Zustand.  Abridged trans. in W.D. Ellis (Ed.), A source book of gestalt psychology. (pp. 71-88). New York: The Humanities Press. (Original work published in 1920).&lt;/ref&gt;

Isomorphism can also be described as the similarity in the gestalt patterning of a stimulus and the activity in the brain while perceiving the stimulus. More generally, this concept is an expression of the materialist view that the properties of mind and consciousness are a direct consequence of the electrochemical interactions within the physical brain.&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, S. (1999). Gestalt Isomorphism and the Quantification of Spatial Perception. Gestalt Theory, 21(2). Retrieved November 1, 2012, from http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/isomorph/isomorph.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used example of isomorphism is the [[phi phenomenon]], in which a row of lights flashing in sequence creates the illusion of motion. It is argued that the brain state created by this stimulus matches the brain state created by a patch of light moving from one location to another. The stimulus is perceived as motion because the subjective percept of spatial structure is correlated with electric fields in the brain whose spatial pattern mirrors the spatial structure in the perceived world.&lt;ref&gt;Luchins, A. S., &amp; Luchins, E. H. (1999). Isomorphism in Gestalt Theory: Comparison of Wertheimer's and Köhler's Concepts. Gestalt Theory, 21(3).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3683">A '''jeremiad''' is a long literary work, usually in [[prose]], but sometimes in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], in which the author bitterly laments the state of society and its morals in a serious tone of sustained invective, and always contains a [[prophecy]] of society's imminent downfall.

==Origins and usage==
The word is an [[eponym]], named after the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[prophet]] [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], and comes from Biblical works attributed to him, the ''[[Book of Jeremiah]]'' and the ''[[Book of Lamentations]]''.  The Book of Jeremiah prophesies the coming downfall of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], and asserts that this is because its rulers have broken the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God|the Lord]].

The ''Lamentations'', similarly, lament the fall of the kingdom of Judah after the conquest prophesied by Jeremiah has occurred:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!&lt;br&gt;She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;  Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.&lt;br&gt;The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;Lamentations 1:1–4 ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally, the term ''jeremiad'' is applied to moralistic texts that denounce a society for its wickedness, and prophesy its downfall. The jeremiad was a favorite literary device of the Puritans especially in sermons like "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]" by [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Bruce C. Puritans at Play. New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-7212-5}} {{Page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors from [[Gildas]] to [[Robert Bork]] have had this label hung on their works. Extending that tradition in a reflective vein is the [[A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass|autobiographical work]] of freed American slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who lamented the moral corruption that slavery wrought on America – from both a [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Christian]] tradition. In contemporary usage, it is frequently [[pejorative]], meant to suggest that the tone of the text is excessively [[pessimism|pessimistic]] and overwrought.

It is a [[comprehensive exam|comprehensive exit exam]]. The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT MBA Flyer |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) and has been used in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Most MBA programs require an exit exam to gauge students' comprehensive competency in the field of business management.&lt;ref name="Study Guide"&gt;{{cite book| last =Phelan| first =James| title =The Major Field Test (MFT) for MBA Study Guide| publisher =Practical Application Publications| date =2014| location =Charleston, SC| isbn =0-9779773-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA began being offered in 2002. It was developed nationally by leading educators to assess the skills of graduating MBA students.&lt;ref name="Hays Post"&gt;{{cite news| last = Hays Post staff| title = FHSU MBA students bring in top scores on national MFT exam| newspaper = Hays Post| location = Fort Hays| publisher = Hays Post| date = May 16, 2015| url = http://www.hayspost.com/2015/05/16/fhsu-mba-students-bring-in-top-scores-on-national-mft-exam/| accessdate = October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a tool to compare business programs across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ingle| first = John | title = Midwestern State University on affordable list| newspaper = Times Record News| location = Witchita Falls| publisher = Journal Media Group| date = August 28, 2014| url = http://www.timesrecordnews.com/business/msu-on-affordable-list_23258473| accessdate = October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETS issues an updated test every 3–4 years in attempt to ensure high content validity.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; The most recent test forms are 4BMF (February 2005 - June 2009), 4FMF (September 2009 - June 2013), and 4JMF (September 2013 – present).&lt;ref name="2009 4BMF Scoring Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/MFT/pdf/MFT%20PDFs%202007/MBA4BMF.pdf |title=MBA 4BMF |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706064126/https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/MFT/pdf/MFT%20PDFs%202007/MBA4BMF.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2015 4JMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2015 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The MFT-MBA is based on MBA core curriculum.  Unlike tests that are not aligned to anything but their own curriculum, the MFT-MBA emphasizes content validity.   In order to display [[normative|normativity]] and ensure a consensus of what best reflects core curriculum, the content is constructed using results of a national curriculum survey.  According to ETS, content experts from a diverse representation of higher education institutions (including Major Field Test users and nonusers) participate in this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/ |title=Test Content Overview |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basing the exam on core curriculum makes it a level playing field exam, giving it meaningful results and enabling it to measure reasoning ability.&lt;ref name="Honors Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t10mba.com/admission |title=Membership Admission Requirements |publisher=T10 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;

The test contains 124 [[multiple-choice]] questions. There are approximately 32 [[management]] questions, 31 [[marketing]] questions, 33 [[finance]] questions, and 28 [[management accounting|managerial accounting]] questions.  Half of the questions require the strategic integration of two or more subject areas.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;  In addition to factual knowledge, the test evaluates the student's abilities to interpret materials, understand relationships, and analyze and solve problems.&lt;ref name="Hays Post" /&gt; 

The Major Field Test for MBA can only be taken once.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt; The amount of time allotted for taking the test is three hours.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; It is taken on a computer.  All exams are given at proctored facilities. Test takers are provided with scratch paper and pencils, but calculators are not permitted. All test questions present four answer options to choose from, only one of which is correct.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt;

The '''Master of Management: Co-operatives and Credit Unions''' ('''MMCCU''') is a [[master's degree]] in [[co-operative]] and [[credit union]] administration. The degree is currently offered solely through an international program at the Sobey School of Business at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] in [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Livingston, Jane. [http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 Co-op Management Master’s Degree Program: Lessons Learned.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920034748/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 |date=2010-09-20 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #124 May - June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed for students entering [[business management]] and degree applicants come from diverse academic disciplines.

The MMCCU degree is designed to improve students' understanding of management within the context of the [[Co-operative economics|co-operative economic model]].&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; Similar to the more traditional [[MBA]], students are introduced to economics, accounting, human resources, marketing, technology, [[best practice]]s and equity management. The MMCCU also teaches the history and philosophy of the co-operative management model and hosts international symposia.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Erbin.

While the coursework is delivered exclusively on-line, participants proceed as cohorts and meet in person three times during the process: once for Orientation Week in Halifax, once for a field trip in the second year and finally for Convocation upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Andrew. (2010). [http://www.geo.coop/node/448 Co-op Studies Go Global: The Master in Management - Cooperatives and Credit Unions.] ''Grassroots Economic Organizing (GEO) Newsletter.'' Volume II, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The MMCCU degree program was created in 2002 by a partnership between Saint Mary's University and the Co-operative Management Education Co-operative (CMEC), a federation of over 50 cooperatives. This co-operative consists of co-operatives, individuals, as well as educational and support institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 A Cooperative Approach to Management Education.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921055629/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 |date=2010-09-21 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #148 May - June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf Come Together, Right Now.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718162134/http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }} ''Cooperative Management Advantage.'' Volume 4, Issue 2. January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Members donated nearly $1 million to fund the program and the curriculum was approved by the Maritime Provinces' Higher Education Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novkovic|first1=Sonja|last2=Holm|first2=Wendy|title=Co-operative networks as a source of organizational innovation|journal=International Journal of Co-operative Management|date=October 2012|volume=6|issue=1|page=55|url=http://theholmteam.ca/Co-operative.Mgmt.Journal.Oct.2012.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was founded by Saint Mary's University Professor John Chamard&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=Consider your options|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20101015161334/http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 15, 2010|work=[[National Post]]|date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took its first students in 2003. The first cohort graduated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Chamard, John.

Volume 40, Number 2. August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While other methods of training in co-operatives exist,{{ref|a|1}} the MMCCU is the only English-language master's degree in co-operative management by a business school that is internationally accredited.&lt;ref name="Ratner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratner|first1=Carl|title=Cooperation, Community, and Co-ops in a Global Era|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4614-5825-0|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5WTgR3mN2oC&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22master%20of%20management%22%20co-operatives&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sobey School of Business, the home of the MMCCU, has accreditation through the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aacsb.net/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AACSB&amp;WebKey=00E50DA9-8BB0-4A32-B7F7-0A92E98DF5C6 List of Accredited Schools by Country] ''[[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of delivery===
The MMCCU is an on-line only program using the [[Blackboard Learning System]] virtual environment. With the exception of the orientation and field trip, the classes only meet on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingston|first1=Jane|title=Mastering Co-op Management|journal=[[Rural Cooperatives]]|date=March 2006|volume=73|issue=2|pages=23–25, 34|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-mar06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students move through the program as a cohort, so once a student starts they must commit to the entire program or drop-out.

==Program content==
The [[Cooperative Principles]] are central to MMCCU curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacPherson|first1=Ian|title=New Opportunities for Co-operatives: New Opportunities for People|date=2012|publisher=University of Helsinki|isbn=978-952-10-6514-9|page=366|chapter=Finding Traction on a Slippery Path: Teaching about Co-operatives, the Co-operative Movement, and Co-operation in Canada|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/ruralia/ica2011/presentations/MacPherson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First year===
In the first semester, students complete the following:
*''Philosophical Philosophical Origins and Historical Evolution of Co-operative Governance and Business Practice'' offers a survey of the historical development of co-operation from the dawn of the Industrial Age and market capitalism to the present day. Students learn about and practice creating [[Social accounting|social audits]].
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective I'' provides an overview of globalization and its effect on the world economy. In addition, students examine examples of global co-operation.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice I: Variety and Range of Co-operative Business''. This course builds off of the history of the first semester. Students learn about the different sectors of co-operation: consumer, producer, housing, financial and worker and multi-stakeholder co-operatives.
*''Co-operative Financial Analysis and Management I'' provides students with a basic understanding of [[managerial accounting]] and [[financial accounting]]. Students learn the basic of an income statement, balance statement, cash flow analysis and equity statement. Students also learn to conduct a financial analysis.

===Second year===
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective II''.
*''Field Research: Study Visits to Exemplars of Excellent Co-operative Business Practice''. Students learn about the region of the visit and the co-operative society prior to their visit. The remainder of the course examines the lessons learned during the trip and how it might relate to their co-operatives.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice II: Co-operative Innovations and Best Practice'' considers different co-operatives on an individual level in order to understand how different co-operators solve similar problems.
*''Technology, Communication and Co-operation'' examines the role of technology in society and how co-operatives might use it to succeed.

====Field trip====
The field trip currently alternates between two locations. The first is the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon Co-operative]] in northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="ica"&gt;Parnell, Edgar. [http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf Masters of Management - Co-ops and Credit Unions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231155736/http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf |date=2010-12-31 }} ''[[International Co-operative Alliance|ICA Digest]].'' Issue 38. March 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Students spend 10 days studying the Mondragon Co-operative and learning about the culture of the region.

The second location involves the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="ica"/&gt; Students tour and study the worker co-operatives and co-operative federations of the region.

===Third year===
*''Marketing the Co-operative Advantage: Co-operative Education, Member Relations and Marketing''. This course examines basic [[Marketing strategy|marketing strategies]] and the [[Statement on the Co-operative Identity|co-operative identity]].
*''Co-operative Financial Analysis and Management II'', focuses on the role of equity in a co-operative. Students learn about equity development and how it interacts in a co-operative.
*''The Co-operative Management Approach I: Governance, Planning and Strategic Analysis''. Students learn about these three important areas of management through a co-operative lens.
*''The Co-operative Management Approach II: Leadership, Personnel and Management Style'', examines the role of [[human resources]] in a co-operative.

===Master's project===
The last year of the master's program has been dedicated to the project. Students are expected to develop a change in their co-operative based on the lessons learned through their program.

===Financial aid options===
The [[Sid Pobihushchy]] scholarship is available for students pursuing an MMCCU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frederictoncoop.nb.ca/eflyerforca.html Awards for 2010-2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526042343/http://www.frederictoncoop.nb.ca/eflyerforca.html |date=2011-05-26 }} ''Fredericton Co-op website.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other means of financial aid will depend upon competitive grants and scholarships such as the Lemaire Scholarship provided by the [[Canadian Association for Study in Co-operatives]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaskstudies.coop/teaching/scholarships/CASC.php#lemaire Lemaire Co-operative Studies Awards.] ''Centre for the Study of Co-operatives.'', private grants and the specific awards available in one's home country.

==Reception==
A survey of co-operative managers who completed the degree found that while they were satisfied with the program, only 40% of respondents were able to implement ideas they learned in their workplaces.&lt;ref name="Ratner"/&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|a}}[[CooperationWorks!]] trains cooperative developers in the United States. The [[University of Toronto]] offers an undergraduate program in co-operatives, the [[University of Wisconsin]] offers a survey course on co-operatives, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] offers an undergraduate certificate in applied economic research on cooperatives.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung'') was founded in 1969 and is one of the 82 Max Planck Institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]]. It is located on a campus in Stuttgart, together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems]].

== Research Focus ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research is focused on the physics and chemistry of condensed matter, including especially complex materials and nanoscale science. In both of these fields, electronic and ionic transport phenomena are of particular interest.

== Organization ==
The institute currently has eight departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.fkf.mpg.de/3721/10_Departments|title=Departments|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic Structure Theory===
Led by Ali Alavi, the Department of Electronic Structure Theory is concerned with the development of [[ab initio]] methods for treating [[correlated electronic systems]], using [[Quantum Monte Carlo]], quantum chemical and many-body methodologies. Ab initio methods (including density functional theory) will be applied to problems of interest in heterogeneous catalysis, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and photochemistry.

===Solid State Spectroscopy===
The Department of Solid State Spectroscopy is headed by Bernhard Keimer. [[Collective quantum phenomena]] in highly correlated electronic materials are studied by spectroscopic and scattering techniques. Topics of particular current interest include the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides, the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, and the control of electronic phase behavior in metal-oxide superlattices. The department also develops new spectroscopic methods such as high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and spectral ellipsometry.

===Nanoscale Science===
Research efforts in the Department of Nanoscale Science, directed by Klaus Kern, are centered on nanometer-scale science and technology with a focus on the bottom-up paradigm. The aim of the interdisciplinary research at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology is to gain control of materials at the atomic and molecular level, enabling the design of systems and devices with properties determined by quantum behavior on one hand and approaching functionalities of living matter on the other hand.

===Low Dimensional Electron Systems===
The main focus of the scientific work in the Department Low Dimensional Electron Systems is on electronic properties of 2-, 1-, and 0-dimensional electron systems, in particular the influence of quantum phenomena on the transport and optical response. It is headed by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Physical Chemistry of Solids===
Under Joachim Maier, the Department of Physical Chemistry of Solids is concerned with [[electrochemistry]] and [[ion transport]]. Emphasis is laid on ion conductors (such as inorganic or organic proton, metal ion and oxygen ion conductors) and mixed conductors (typically perovskites). The research ranges from the exploration of basic mechanisms to the design of materials for electrochemical applications (batteries, fuel cells, sensors). Of special significance is the scientific foundation of the field Nanoionics.

===Solid State Quantum Electronics===
Induced by quantum mechanical phenomena, heterostructures grown from complex materials offer a fascinating potential to create novel electron systems. Many have outstanding properties that are not otherwise found in nature. The design, growth, and exploration of such electron systems are at the focus of the Department of Solid State Quantum Electronics spearheaded by [[Klaus von Klitzing]].

===Quantum Many-Body Theory===
Directed by Walter Metzner, Electronic properties of solids are analyzed and computed in the Department of Quantum Many-Body Theory with a main emphasis on systems where electronic correlations play a crucial role, such as [[cuprates]], [[manganites]] and other [[transition metal oxides]]. Besides symmetry-breaking phase transitions leading to [[magnetism]], orbital and charge order, or [[superconductivity]], correlations can also cause electron localization and many other striking many-body effects not described by the independent electron approximation.

===[[Quantum materials|Quantum Materials]]===
Entanglement of electrons in solids, in combination with details of the crystal lattice structure, produce a surprisingly rich variety of electronic phases, that are liquid, liquid-crystal and crystalline states of the charge and spin degrees of freedom. These complex electronic phases and the subtle competition among them very often give rise to novel functionality. The Department of Quantum Materials, led by Hidenori Takagi, is studying these interesting novel phases in transition metal oxides and related compounds where the narrow d-bands, which give rise to strong electron correlations, in combination with the rich chemistry of such materials provide excellent opportunities for new discoveries.

{{War}}
'''Military history''' is a [[humanities]] [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]] within the scope of [[History|general historical]] recording of [[War|armed conflict]] in the [[Human history|history of humanity]], and its impact on the societies, their cultures, economies and changing [[Politics|local]] and [[international relations]]hips.

Professional historians normally focus on military affairs that had a major impact on the societies involved as well as the aftermath of conflicts, while amateur historians and hobbyists often take a larger interest in the details of battles, equipment and uniforms in use.

The essential subjects of military history study are the causes of war, the social and cultural foundations, [[Doctrine#Military usage|military doctrine on each side]], the logistics, leadership, technology, [[strategy]], and [[military tactics|tactics]] used, and how these changed over time. On the other hand, [[Just war theory|Just War Theory]] explores the moral dimensions of warfare, and to better limit the destructive reality caused by war, seeks to establish a doctrine of military ethics.

As an applied field, military history has been studied at academies and service schools because the [[Command and control (military)|military command]] seeks to not repeat past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during a battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned from the past.  When certifying military history instructors&lt;ref&gt;http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/csi/mhic&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Combat Studies Institute]] deemphasizes rote detail memorization and focuses on themes and context in relation to current and future conflict, using the motto "Past is Prologue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegriffon108.com/articles/article-detail/articleid/3987/becoming-a-military-history-instructor-in-the-army.aspx|title=Becoming a Military History Instructor in the Army|work=The Griffon 108th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of military history is dynamic, changing with development as much of the subject area as the societies and organisations that make use of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Parker, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic nature of the discipline of military history is largely related to the rapidity of change the military forces, and the art and science of managing them, as well as the frenetic pace of [[Technological evolution|technological development]] that had taken place during the period known as the [[Industrial Revolution]], and more recently in the [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear]] and [[information age]]s.  An important recent concept is the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) which attempts to explain how warfare has been shaped by emerging technologies, such as gunpowder. It highlights the short outbursts of rapid change followed by periods of relative stability.

==Popular versus academic military history==
In terms of the history profession in major countries, military history is an orphan, despite its enormous popularity with the general public. [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] points out:
:This branch of our discipline flourishes in an intellectual ghetto. The 144 books in question [published in 1968-78] fall into two distinct classes: works aimed at a popular readership, written by journalists and men of letters outside academic circles, and professional work nearly always produced within the military establishment.... The study of military history in universities remains seriously underdeveloped. Indeed, lack of interest in and disdain for military history probably constitute one of the strangest prejudices of the profession.&lt;ref&gt;William H McNeill,  "Modern European History" in Michael Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Lynn, "The embattled future of academic military history." ''Journal of Military History'' 61.4 (1997): 777–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian F W Beckett|title=A Guide to British Military History: The Subject and the Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DILbCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|year=2016|publisher=Pen and Sword|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography of military history==
[[Historiography]] is the study of the history and method of the discipline of history or the study of a specialised topic. In this case, military history with an eye to gaining an accurate assessment of conflicts using all available sources. For this reason military history is periodised, creating overlaying boundaries of study and analysis in which descriptions of battles by leaders may be unreliable due to the inclination to minimize mention of failure and exaggerate success. Military historians use Historiographical analysis in an effort to allow an unbiased, contemporary view of records.&lt;ref&gt;Morillo, Pevkovic, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

One military historian, Jeremy Black, outlined problems 21st-century military historians face as an inheritance of their predecessors: Eurocentricity, a technological bias, a focus on leading military powers and dominant military systems, the separation of land from sea and recently air conflicts, the focus on state-to-state conflict, a lack of focus on political "tasking" in how forces are used.&lt;ref name="p.ix, Black"&gt;Black (2004), p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

If these challenges were not sufficient for the military historians, the limits of method are complicated by the lack of records, either destroyed or never recorded for its value as a [[military secret]] that may prevent some salient facts from being reported at all; scholars still do not know the exact nature of [[Greek fire]] for instance. Researching Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, for example, have presented unique challenges to historians due to records that were destroyed to protect classified military information, among other reasons. Historians utilize their knowledge of government regulation and military organization, and employing a targeted and systematic research strategy to piece together war histories.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Hilary, ''Documenting Shock and Awe: Researching Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom' History Associations, 2015. http://www.historyassociates.com/blog/historical-research-blog/researching-iraq-and-afghanistan-wars/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limits, wars are some of the most studied and detailed periods of human history.

Military historians have often [[Comparative history|compared]] organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (Random House, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball studied the influence of a historian's political position on current events on interpretive disagreement regarding the causes of 20th century wars.  He surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians. He finds that their current political views are moderately correlated with their historiographical interpretations. A clear position on the left-right continuum regarding capitalism was apparent in most cases.  All groups agreed with the proposition, "historically, Americans have tended to view questions of their national security  in terms of such extremes as good vs. evil."  Though the Socialists were split, the other groups agreed that "miscalculation and/or misunderstanding of the situation" had caused U.S. interventionism."  Kimball reports that:
:Of historians in the field of diplomatic history, 7% are Socialist, 19% are Other, 53% are Liberal, 11% are None and 10% Conservative. Of military historians, 0% are Socialist, 8% are Other, 35% are Liberal, 18% are None and 40% are  Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kimball, "The Influence of Ideology on Interpretive Disagreement: A Report on a Survey of Diplomatic, Military and Peace Historians on the Causes of 20th Century U. S. Wars," ''The History Teacher''  (May, 1984) 17#3 pp. 355–84 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/493146.pdf in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historians==
The documentation of military history begins with the confrontation between Sumer (current [[Iraq]]) and Elam (current [[Iran]]) c. 2700 BC near the modern [[Basra]]. Other prominent records in military history are the [[Trojan War]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' (though its [[historicity of the Iliad|historicity]] has been challenged), ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' by [[Herodotus]] (484 BC – 425 BC) who is often called the "father of history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s999564.htm "Herodotus: The father of history"], Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Next was [[Thucydides]] whose impartiality, despite being an [[Athens|Athenian]], allowed him to take advantage of his exile to research the war from different perspectives by carefully examining documents and interviewing eyewitnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Karls, pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt; An approach centered on the analysis of a leader was taken by [[Xenophon]] (430 BC – 355 BC) in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', recording the expedition of [[Cyrus the Younger]] into [[Anatolia]].

The records of the Roman [[Julius Caesar]] (100 BC – 44 BC) enable a comparative approach for [[Military campaign|campaigns]] such as ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]''.

==Technological evolution==
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. ''New Glory: Expanding America's Supremacy'', 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Ramses II at Kadesh.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Relief of [[Ramses II]] located in [[Abu Simbel]] fighting at the [[Battle of Kadesh]] on a [[chariot]].]]

New weapons development can dramatically alter the face of war, the cost of warfare, the preparations, and the training of soldiers and leaders. A rule of thumb is that if your enemy has a potentially war winning weapon, you have to either match it or neutralize it.&lt;ref&gt;Barton C. Hacker, "Military institutions, weapons, and social change: Toward a new history of military technology." ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' 35.4 (1994): 768–834.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient era===
[[Chariot]]s originated around 2000 BC. The chariot was an effective, fast weapon; while one man controlled the maneuvering of the chariot, a second bowman could shoot arrows at enemy soldiers. These became crucial to the maintenance of several governments, including the [[New Egyptian Kingdom]] and the [[Shang Dynasty]] and the nation states of early to mid [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Aiken Littauer, "The military use of the chariot in the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age." ''[[American Journal of Archaeology]]'' 76.2 (1972): 145–57. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/503858 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.R.S. Moorey, "The emergence of the light, horse‐drawn chariot in the Near‐East c. 2000–1500 BC." ''[[World Archaeology]]'' 18.2 (1986): 196–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in the ancient world are:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ernest Dupuy, and Trevor Nevitt Dupuy, ''The encyclopedia of military history: from 3500 BC to the present'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sling (weapon)|Slinger]]
* [[Hoplite]]
* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|Auxiliaries]]
* [[Infantry]]
* [[Archery]]
* [[Crossbowmen]]
* [[Chariots]]
* [[Cavalry]]

For settled agrarian civilizations, the infantry became the core of military action. The infantry started as opposing armed groups of soldiers underneath commanders. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and early Romans used rigid, heavily armed [[phalanx formation|phalanxes]]. The Macedonians and Hellenistic states would adopt phalanx formations with [[sarissa]] pikemen. The [[Roman Army|Romans]] would later adopt more flexible [[maniple (military unit)|maniples]] from their neighbors which made them extremely successful in the field of battle. The kingdoms of the [[Warring States]] in East Asia also adopted infantry combat, a transition from chariot warfare from centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D.S. Yates, "New Light on Ancient Chinese Military Texts: Notes on Their Nature and Evolution, and the Development of Military Specialization in Warring States China." ''[[T'oung Pao]]'' (1988): 211–48. {{jstor|4528419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cavalry]] became an important tool. In the [[Sicilian Expedition]], led by Athens in an attempt to subdue [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the well-trained Syracusan cavalry became crucial to the success of the Syracusans. [[Macedon]]ian [[Alexander the Great]] effectively deployed his cavalry forces to secure victories. In battles such as the [[Battle of Cannae]] of the [[Second Punic War]], and the [[Battle of Carrhae]] of the [[Roman-Persian Wars]], the importance of the cavalry would be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie J. Worley, ''Hippeis: the cavalry of Ancient Greece'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also [[horse archer]]s, who had the ability to shoot on horseback&amp;nbsp;– the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]], [[Mongols]], and other various steppe people were especially fearsome with this tactic. By the 3rd–4th century AD, heavily armored cavalry became widely adopted by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Sassanids]], [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms]], etc.

&lt;!--Even in the [[First World War]], cavalry was still considered important; the British mobilized 165,000 horses, the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians more than a million.&lt;ref name=Keegan&gt;Keegan, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
The early [[Indo-Iranians]] developed the use of [[chariot]]s in warfare. The [[scythed chariot]] was later invented in India and soon adopted by the [[Persian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rop,  "Reconsidering the Origin of the Scythed Chariot." ''[[Historia (Antiquity journal)|Historia]]'' 62.2 (2013): 167–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[War elephant]]s were sometimes deployed for fighting in ancient warfare. They were first used in India and later adopted by both the Persians and [[Alexander the Great]] against one another. War elephants were also used in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], and by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] in the [[Second Punic War]] against the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Frederick Gowers|William Gowers]], "The African elephant in warfare." ''[[African Affairs]]'' 46.182 (1947): 42–49. {{doi|10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a093538}}, {{jstor|718841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trireme.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Greek [[trireme]]]]
[[Naval warfare]] was often crucial to military success. Early navies used sailing ships without cannons; often the goal was to ram the enemy ships and cause them to sink. There was human oar power, often using slaves, built up to ramming speed. [[Galley]]s were used in the [[3000 BC|3rd millennium BC]] by the [[Crete|Cretans]]. The Greeks later advanced these ships.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Morrison, "The Greek Trireme." ''[[The Mariner's Mirror]]'' 27.1 (1941): 14–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
H. T. Wallinga, "The Trireme and History" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]''  Vol. 43, Fasc. 1/2, 1990  pp. 132–49. {{jstor|4431893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1210 BC, the first recorded naval battle was fought between [[Suppiluliuma II]], king of the [[Hittites]], and [[Cyprus]], which was defeated. In the [[Persian Wars]], the navy became of increasing importance.

[[Trireme]]s were involved in more complicated sea-land operations. [[Themistocles]] helped to build up a stronger Greek navy, composed of 310 ships, and defeated the Persians at the [[Battle of Salamis]], ending the Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Moerbeek, Martijn (January 21, 1998). [https://web.archive.org/web/20020514151335/http://monolith.dnsalias.org/~marsares/warfare/battle/salamis.html "The battle of Salamis, 480 BC"] Accessed May 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Punic War]], the war between [[Carthage]] and Rome started with an advantage to Carthage because of their naval experience. A Roman fleet was built in 261 BC, with the addition of the [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] that allowed Roman soldiers on board the ships to board the enemy ships. The bridge would prove effective at the [[Battle of Mylae]], resulting in a Roman victory.

The [[Vikings]], in the 8th century AD, invented a ship propelled by oars with a dragon decorating the prow, hence called the [[Drekar|Drakkar]]. The 12th century AD [[Song Dynasty]] invented ships with watertight bulk head compartments while the 2nd century BC [[Han Dynasty]] invented rudders and sculled oars for their warships.

[[Fortification]]s are important in warfare. Early [[hill-fort]]s were used to protect inhabitants in the [[Iron Age]]. They were primitive forts surrounded by ditches filled with water.  Forts were then built out of mud bricks, stones, wood, and other available materials. Romans used rectangular fortresses built out of wood and stone. As long as there have been fortifications, there have been contraptions to break in, dating back to the times of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and earlier. [[Siege]] warfare is often necessary to capture forts.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.timeref.com/casterly.htm "The Medieval Castle"]. Accessed May 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle-ages===
[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|240px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ships in 1281]]
Some of the military unit types and technologies which were used in the medieval period are:
* [[Artillery]]
* [[Cataphract]]
* [[Condottieri]]
* [[Fyrd]]
* [[Rashidun army|Rashidun]]
* [[Mobile guard]]
* [[Mamluk]]
* [[Janissary]]
* [[Knight]] (see also: [[Chivalry]])
* [[Crossbow]]
* [[Pikeman]]
* [[Samurai]]
* [[Sipahi]]
* [[Trebuchet]]

[[Bow (weapon)|Bows]] and [[Arrow (weapon)|arrows]] were often used by combatants. Egyptians shot arrows from chariots effectively. The [[crossbow]] was developed around 500 BC in China, and was used a lot in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Selby, Stephen (2001). [http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm "A Crossbow Mechanism with Some Unique Features from Shandong, China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518053806/http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm |date=2008-05-18 }}. Accessed on May 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English/Welsh [[longbow]] from the 12th century also became important in the Middle Ages. It helped to give the English a large early advantage in the [[Hundred Years' War]], even though the English were eventually defeated. The [[Battle of Crécy]] and the [[Battle of Agincourt]] are excellent examples of how to destroy an enemy using a longbow. It dominated battlefields for over a century.

===The rise of gunpowder===
[[File:Cannon pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A small [[English Civil War]]-era cannon]]
In the 10th century, the invention of gunpowder led to many new weapons that were improved over time. [[Black powder]] was used in China since the 4th century, but it was not used as a weapon until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda J. Buchanan, ed., ''Gunpowder, explosives and the state: a technological history'' (Ashgate, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the mid-15th century, guns were held in one hand, while the [[explosive charge]] was ignited by the other hand. Then came the [[matchlock]], which was used widely until around the 1720s. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made drawings of the [[wheel lock]] which made its own sparks. Eventually, the matchlock was replaced by the [[flintlock]].  [[Cannon]]s were first used in Europe in the early 14th century, and played a vital role in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The first cannons were simply welded metal bars in the form of a cylinder, and the first cannonballs were made of stone. By 1346, at the Battle of Crécy, the cannon had been used; at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] they would be used again.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, J.B. (February 19, 2006) [http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm "Cannons and Gunpowder"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701172502/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm |date=2007-07-01 }}. Accessed on May 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.C.B. Rogers, ''A History of Artillery'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century, the first European [[fire ship]]s were used. Ships were filled with flammable materials, set on fire, and sent to enemy lines. This tactic was successfully used by [[Francis Drake]] to scatter the [[Spanish Armada]] at the Battle of [[Gravelines]],&lt;ref&gt;Jorge. [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/defeat_of_the_armada.htm The "Invincible" Armada]. Accessed on May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and would later be used by the Chinese, Russians, Greeks, and several other countries in naval battles.

[[Naval mines]] were invented in the 17th century, though they were not used in great numbers until the [[American Civil War]]. They were used heavily in the [[First World War|First]] and Second World Wars. Air-deployed naval mines were used to mine the [[North Vietnamese]] port of [[Haiphong]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[Iraqi Navy]] of [[Saddam Hussein]] used naval mines extensively during the [[Tanker War]], as part of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

The first navigable [[submarine]] was built in 1624 by [[Cornelius Drebbel]], it could cruise at a depth of 15 feet (5&amp;nbsp;m). However, the first military submarine was constructed in 1885 by [[Isaac Peral]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Parrish, ''The Submarine: A History'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Turtle|''Turtle'']] was developed by [[David Bushnell]] during the [[American Revolution]]. [[Robert Fulton]] then improved the submarine design by creating the [[Nautilus (submarine)|''Nautilus'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060217031100/http://submarinehistory.homestead.com/EarlyUnderwaterwarfare.html |archivedate=February 17, 2006 |title=Early Underwater Warfare |url=http://submarinehistory.homestead.com/EarlyUnderwaterwarfare.html |date=May 18, 2006 |publisher=California Center for Military History |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:155fire.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[M198 howitzer]] firing a shell.]]
The [[Howitzer]], a type of [[field artillery]], was developed in the 17th century to fire high trajectory explosive shells at targets that could not be reached by flat trajectory projectiles.

Organizational changes resulting in better training and intercommunication, made the concept [[combined arms]] possible, allowing the use of infantry, cavalry, and [[artillery]] in a coordinated way.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Bayonets also became of wide usage to infantry soldiers. [[Bayonet]] is named after [[Bayonne]], France where it was first manufactured in the 16th century. It is used often in infantry charges to fight in hand-to-hand combat. General [[Jean Martinet]] introduced the bayonet to the French army. They were used heavily in the [[American Civil War]], and continued to be used in modern wars like the [[Invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Brayley, ''Bayonets: An Illustrated History'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balloon (aircraft)|Balloons]] were first used in warfare at the end of the 18th century. It was first introduced in Paris of 1783; the first balloon traveled over 5&amp;nbsp;miles (8&amp;nbsp;km). Previously military [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] could only see from high points on the ground, or from the mast of a ship. Now they could be high in the sky, signalling to troops on the ground. This made it much more difficult for troop movements to go unobserved.&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher, ''Balloons at War: Gasbags, Flying Bombs &amp; Cold War Secrets'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 18th century, iron-cased [[artillery rocket]]s were successfully used militarily in India against the British by [[Tipu Sultan]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Rockets were generally inaccurate at that time, though [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]], in 1844, was able to develop a better rocket. The new rocket no longer needed the [[rocket stick]], and had a higher accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;HM Iftekhar Jaim, and Jasmine Jaim, "The Decisive Nature of the Indian War Rocket in the Anglo-Mysore Wars of the Eighteenth Century." ''Arms &amp; Armour'' 8.2 (2011): 131–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s there were a series of advancements in [[rifle]]s. The first [[repeating rifle]] was designed in 1860 by a company bought out by [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]], which made new and improved versions. [[Springfield rifle]]s arrived in the mid-19th century also. [[Machine gun]]s arrived in the late 19th century. [[Automatic rifle]]s and [[light machine gun]]s first arrived at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Held, ''The Age of Firearms: a pictorial history.'' (Harper, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later part of the 19th century, the self-propelled [[torpedo]] was developed. The [[HNoMS Rap (1873)|HNoMS Rap]] was the world's first torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;George Elliot Armstrong, ''Torpedoes and Torpedo-vessels'' (1896) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YDzWQbUP3sUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=History+Torpedo+Armstrong&amp;ots=Yi8gMyNBO_&amp;sig=bDvs5yoMT1OCwmQ-12xIoHeh_co online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern technologies===
At the start of the World Wars, various nations had developed weapons that were a surprise to their adversaries, leading to a need to learn from this, and alter how to combat them. [[Flame thrower]]s were first used in the First World War. The French were the first to introduce the [[Armored car (military)|armored car]] in 1902. Then in 1918, the British produced the first [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored troop carrier]]. Many early [[tank]]s were proof of concept but impractical until further development. In World War I, the British and French held a crucial advantage due to their superiority in tanks; the Germans had only a few dozen A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;V tanks, as well as 170 captured tanks. The British and French both had several hundred each. The French tanks included the 13 ton [[Schneider-Creusot]], with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun, and the British had the [[Mark I tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]] and [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wright, ''Tank: the progress of a monstrous war machine'' (Penguin, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 1903, the [[Wright Brothers]] performed the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight; it went 39 meters (120&amp;nbsp;ft). In 1907, the first [[helicopter]] flew, but it wasn't practical for usage. [[World War I Aviation|Aviation]] became important in World War I, in which several [[Flying ace|aces]] gained fame. In 1911 an aircraft took off from a warship for the first time. Landings on a cruiser were another matter. This led to the development of an [[aircraft carrier]] with a decent unobstructed flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Polmar, ''Aircraft carriers: a graphic history of carrier aviation and its influence on world events'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemical warfare]] exploded into the public consciousness in World War I but may have been used in earlier wars without as much human attention. The Germans used gas-filled shells at the [[Battle of Bolimov]] on January 3, 1915. These were not lethal, however. In April 1915, the Germans developed a chlorine gas that was highly lethal, and used it to moderate effect at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Gas masks were invented in matter of weeks, and poison gas proved ineffective at winning battles. It was made illegal by all nations in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Coleman, ''A history of chemical warfare'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II gave rise to even more technology. The worth of the aircraft carrier was proved in the battles between the United States and Japan like the [[Battle of Midway]]. [[Radar]] was independently invented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis powers]]. It used [[radio wave]]s to detect objects. [[Molotov cocktail]]s were invented by General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, directing the Nationalists to use them against Soviet tanks in the assault on Toledo. The [[atomic bomb]] was developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, quickly ending World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jenkins, ''World War 2: New Technologies'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the main powers engaged in a [[Nuclear arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul P. Craig and John A. Jungerman, ''The Nuclear Arms Race: Technology and Society'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[space race]], both nations attempted to launch human beings into space to the moon. Other technological advances centered on intelligence (like the [[spy satellite]]) and missiles ([[ballistic missile]]s, [[cruise missile]]s). [[Nuclear submarine]], invented in 1955. This meant submarines no longer had to surface as often, and could run more quietly. They evolved into becoming underwater missile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''The Cold War: A Military History'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periods of military history==
The influence of technology on military history, and evident Eurocentrism are nowhere more pronounced than in the attempt by the military historians to divide their subject area into more manageable [[Periodization|periods]] of analysis. While general discipline of history subdivides history into Ancient history (Classical antiquity), Middle Ages (Europe, 4th century – 15th century), Early Modern period (Europe, 14th century – 18th century), Modern era (Europe, 18th century – 20th century), and the Post-Modern (USA, 1949–present), the periodisation below stresses technological change in its emphasis, particularly the crucial dramatic change during the Gunpowder warfare period.

Periodisation is not uniformly applied through time and space, affirming the claims of Eurocentrism from regional historians. For example, what might be described as [[prehistoric warfare]] is still practised in a few parts of the world. Other eras that are distinct in European history, such as the era of [[medieval warfare]], may have little relevance in East Asia.

===Ancient warfare===
{{details|Ancient warfare}}

Much of what we know of [[ancient history]] is the history of militaries: their conquests, their movements, and their technological innovations. There are many reasons for this. Kingdoms and empires, the central units of control in the ancient world, could only be maintained through military force. Due to limited agricultural ability, there were relatively few areas that could support large communities, so fighting was common.

[[Weapon]]s and [[armor]], designed to be sturdy, tended to last longer than other artifacts, and thus a great deal of surviving artifacts recovered tend to fall in this category as they are more likely to survive. Weapons and armor were also mass-produced to a scale that makes them quite plentiful throughout history, and thus more likely to be found in archaeological digs.

Such items were also considered signs of prosperity or virtue, and thus were likely to be placed in tombs and monuments to prominent warriors. And writing, when it existed, was often used for kings to boast of military conquests or victories.

Writing, when used by the common man, also tended to record such events, as major battles and conquests constituted major events that many would have considered worthy of recording either in an epic such as the [[Homeric]] writings pertaining to the Trojan War, or even personal writings. Indeed, the earliest stories center on warfare, as war was both a common and dramatic aspect of life; the witnessing of a major battle involving many thousands of soldiers would be quite a spectacle, even today, and thus considered worthy both of being recorded in song and art, but also in realistic histories, as well as being a central element in a fictional work.

Lastly, as [[nation states]] evolved and empires grew, the increased need for order and efficiency lead to an increase in the number of records and writings. Officials and armies would have good reason for keeping detailed records and accounts involving any and all things concerning a matter such as warfare that in the words of [[Sun Tzu]] was "a matter of vital importance to the state". For all these reasons, military history comprises a large part of ancient history.

Notable militaries in the ancient world included the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Babylon]]ians, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (notably the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Macedon]]ians), [[Military history of India|Indians]] (notably the [[Magadha]]s, [[Gangaridai]]s, [[Gandhara]]s and [[Cholas]]), Early Imperial [[History of China|Chinese]] (notably the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Han (state)|Han]] Dynasties), [[Xiongnu]] Confederation, Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]].

The [[fertile crescent]] of [[Mesopotamia]] was the center of several prehistoric conquests. Mesopotamia was conquered by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns and Persians. [[Iran]]ians were the first nation to introduce [[cavalry]] into their army.&lt;ref name="Suren-Pahlav"&gt;Suren-Pahlav S., ''General Surena; The Hero of Carrhae''&lt;!-- link blocked by spam filter: http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/ashkanian/surena.htm ; accessed Jan 16, 2007 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] began growing as an ancient power, but eventually fell to the [[Libya]]ns, [[Nubia]]ns, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Arab]]s.

The earliest recorded battle in [[History of India|India]] was the [[Battle of the Ten Kings]]. The [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains a detailed study on ancient warfare, including topics on [[espionage]] and [[war elephant]]s.

[[Alexander the Great]] invaded Northwestern India and defeated [[King Porus]] in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]]. The same region was soon re conquered by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] after defeating the Macedonians and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. He also went on to conquer the [[Nanda Dynasty|Nanda Empire]] and unify Northern India. Most of Southern Asia was unified under his grandson [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] after the [[Kalinga War]], though the empire collapsed not long after his reign.

In China, the [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] had risen and collapsed. This led to a [[Warring States period]], in which several states continued to fight with each other over territory. Philosopher-strategists such as [[Confucius]] and [[Sun Tzu]] wrote various manuscripts on ancient warfare (as well as international diplomacy).

The Warring States era philosopher [[Mozi]] ([[Micius]]) and his [[Mohist]] followers invented various siege weapons and siegecraft, including the Cloud Ladder (a four-wheeled, extendable ramp) to scale fortified walls during a siege of an enemy city. The warring states were first unified by [[Qin Shi Huang]] after a series of military conquests, creating the first empire in China.

His [[Qin Dynasty|empire]] was succeeded by the [[Han Dynasty]], which expanded into Central [[Asia]], Northern China/Manchuria, Southern China, and present day Korea and Vietnam. The Han came into conflict with settled people such as the [[Wiman Joseon]], and proto-Vietnamese Nanyue. They also came into conflict with the [[Xiongnu]] ([[Huns]]), [[Yuezhi]], and other steppe civilizations.

The Han defeated and drove the Xiongnus west, securing the city-states along the silk route that continued into the [[Parthia]]n Empire. After the decline of central imperial authority, the Han Dynasty collapsed into an era of civil war and continuous warfare during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period in the 3rd century AD.

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Persian Empire was founded by [[Cyrus the Great]] after conquering the [[Medes|Median Empire]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], [[Lydia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. His successor [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]] went on to conquer the [[Egyptian Empire]], much of Central Asia, and parts of Greece, India and Libya. The empire later fell to Alexander the Great after defeating [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]]. After being ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, the Persian Empire was subsequently ruled by the Parthian and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] dynasties, which were the [[Roman Empire]]'s greatest rivals during the [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

In [[Greece]], several [[city-state]]s rose to power, including [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. The Greeks successfully stopped two Persian invasions, the first at the [[Battle of Marathon]], where the Persians were led by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]], and the second at the [[Battle of Salamis]], a naval battle where the Greek ships were deployed by orders of [[Themistocles]] and the Persians were under [[Xerxes I]], and the land engagement of the [[Battle of Plataea]].

The [[Peloponnesian War]] then erupted between the two Greek powers Athens and Sparta. Athens built a long wall to protect its inhabitants, but the wall helped to facilitate the spread of a plague that killed about 30,000 Athenians, including [[Pericles]]. After a disastrous campaign against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the Athenian navy was decisively defeated by [[Lysander]] at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]].

The [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], underneath [[Philip II of Macedon]] and Alexander the Great, invaded Persia and won several major victories, establishing Macedonia as a major power. However, following Alexander's death at an early age, the empire quickly fell apart.

[[File:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The 3rd-century [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]] depicts a battle between [[Military of ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Goths]].]]
Meanwhile, Rome was gaining power, following a rebellion against the [[Etruscans]]. During the three [[Punic Wars]], the Romans defeated the neighboring power of Carthage. The [[First Punic War]] centered on [[naval warfare]]. The [[Second Punic War]] started with [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy by crossing the [[Alps]]. He famously won the encirclement at the [[Battle of Cannae]]. However, after [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] invaded Carthage, Hannibal was forced to follow and was defeated at the [[Battle of Zama]], ending the role of Carthage as a power.

After defeating Carthage the Romans went on to become the Mediterranean's dominant power, successfully campaigning in Greece, ([[Aemilius Paulus]] decisive victory over Macedonia at the [[Battle of Pydna]]), in the Middle East ([[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]]), in [[Gaul]] ([[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]) and defeating several [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] ([[Gaius Marius]], [[Germanicus]]). While Roman armies suffered several major losses, their large population and ability (and will) to replace battlefield casualties, their training, organization, tactical and technical superiority enabled Rome to stay a predominant military force for several centuries, utilizing well trained and maneuverable armies to routinely overcome the much larger "tribal" armies of their foes (see Battles of [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]], [[Battle of Tigranocerta|Tigranocerta]], [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]).

In 54 BC the Roman triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] took the offensive against the [[Parthian Empire]] in the east. In a decisive battle at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]] Romans were defeated and the golden [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquilae]] (legionary battle standards) were taken as trophies to [[Ctesiphon]]. The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the Roman Republic in its entire history.

While successfully dealing with foreign opponents, Rome experienced numerous civil wars, notably the power struggles of Roman generals such as Marius and [[Sulla]] during the end of the Republic. Caesar was also notable for his role in the civil war against the other member of the Triumvirate (Pompey) and against the Roman Senate.

The successors of Caesar&amp;nbsp;– Octavian and Mark Anthony, also fought a civil war with Caesar's assassins (Senators Brutus, Cassius, etc.). Octavian and Mark Anthony eventually fought another civil war between themselves to determine the sole ruler of Rome. Octavian emerged victorious and Rome was turned into an empire with a huge standing army of professional soldiers.

By the time of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the Romans had expanded to the Atlantic Ocean in the west and to [[Mesopotamia]] in the east and controlled Northern Africa and Central Europe up to the [[Black Sea]]. However, Aurelius marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]], and Rome quickly fell into decline.

The [[Hun]]s, [[Goths]], and other barbaric groups invaded Rome, which continued to suffer from [[inflation]] and other internal strifes. Despite the attempts of [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], and [[Theodosius I]], western Rome collapsed and was eventually conquered in 476. The [[Byzantium|Byzantine empire]] continued to prosper, however.

When [[stirrups]] came into use some time during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] militaries were forever changed. This invention coupled with technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], changing military tactics and the role of [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]].

Similar patterns of warfare existed in other parts of the world. In China around the 5th century armies moved from massed infantry to cavalry based forces, copying the [[steppe]] [[nomad]]s. The Middle East and North Africa used similar, if often more advanced, technologies than Europe.

In Japan the Medieval warfare period is considered by many to have stretched into the 19th century. In Africa along the [[Sahel]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] states like the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] and [[Fulani Empire]] employed Medieval tactics and weapons well after they had been supplanted in Europe.

In the [[Medieval]] period, [[feudalism]] was firmly implanted, and there existed many landlords in Europe. Landlords often owned [[castle]]s to protect their territory.

The Islamic [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] began rapidly expanding throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, initially led by [[Rashidun Caliphate]], and later under the [[Umayyads]]. While their attempts to invade Europe by way of the Balkans were [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|defeated]] by [[Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Great Battles of Bulgaria]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Arabs expanded to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] in the east. The [[Abassid]]s then took over the Arab Empire, though the Umayyads remained in control of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]].

At the [[Battle of Tours]], the [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] stopped short a Muslim invasion. The Abassids defeated the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Chinese army at the [[Battle of Talas]], but were later defeated by the [[Seljuk Turk]]s and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] centuries later, until the Arab Empire eventually came to an end after the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Battle of Baghdad]] in 1258.

In China, the [[Sui Dynasty]] had risen and conquered the Chen Dynasty of the south. They invaded Vietnam (northern Vietnam had been in Chinese control since the Han Dynasty), fighting the troops of [[Champa]], who had cavalry mounted on elephants. After decades of economic turmoil and a [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|failed invasion of Korea]], the Sui collapsed and was followed by the Tang Dynasty, who fought with various [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] of [[Lhasa]], the [[Tanguts]], the [[Khitans]], and collapsed due to political fragmentation of powerful regional military governors (jiedushi). The innovative [[Song Dynasty]] followed next, inventing new weapons of war that employed the use of [[Greek Fire]] and [[gunpowder]] (see section below) against enemies such as the [[Jurchens]].
[[File:Autor nieznany (malarz z kręgu Lukasa Cranacha Starszego), Bitwa pod Orszą.jpg|thumb|The victory of the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars|Polish-Lithuanian]] forces over the Muscovites at the [[Battle of Orsha]] in 1514]]

The [[Mongol]]s under [[Genghis Khan]], [[Ögedei Khan]], [[Möngke Khan]], and [[Kublai Khan]] conquered most of Eurasia. They took over China, Persia, Turkestan, and Russia. After Kublai Khan took power and created the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the divisions of the empire ceased to cooperate with each other, and the Mongol Empire was only nominally united.

In New Zealand, prior to European discovery, oral histories, legends and [[whakapapa]] include many stories of battles and wars. [[Māori people|Māori]] warriors were held in high esteem. One group of [[Polynesians]] migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]], where they developed the largely pacifist [[Moriori people|Moriori]] culture. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland Māori in the 1830s.

They proceeded to massacre the Moriori and enslave the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/Moriori/4/en "Moriori - The impact of new arrivals"] ''Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=607&amp;PHPSESSID=1c2fab7979e45ccc7c3e7336e8636142 "Chatham Islands"] ''New Zealand A to Z''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warrior]] culture also developed in the isolated [[Hawaiian Islands]]. During the 1780s and 1790s the chiefs and alii were constantly fighting for power. After a series of battles the Hawaiian Islands were united for the first time under a single ruler who would become known as [[Kamehameha I]].

===Gunpowder warfare===
{{details|Gunpowder warfare}}
[[File:Batalla Sebastian Vranckx.jpg|thumb|[[Eighty Years' War]], or [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spain]]
After [[gunpowder]] weapons were first developed in [[Song Dynasty]] China (see also [[Technology of Song Dynasty]]), the technology later spread west to the [[Ottoman Empire]], from where it spread to the [[Safavid Empire]] of Persia and the [[Mughal Empire]] of India. The [[arquebus]] was later adopted by European armies during the [[Italian Wars]] of the early 16th century.

This all brought an end to the dominance of armored cavalry on the battlefield. The simultaneous decline of the feudal system&amp;nbsp;– and the absorption of the medieval city-states into larger states&amp;nbsp;– allowed the creation of professional standing armies to replace the [[Feudalism|feudal levies]] and mercenaries that had been the standard military component of the Middle Ages.

In Africa, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]], was the first African commander to use gunpowder on the continent in the [[Ethiopian–Adal War]], that lasted for fourteen years (1529–1543).

The period spanning between the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] and the 1789 [[French Revolution]] is also known as ''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' (Princes' warfare) as wars were mainly carried out by imperial or monarchics states, decided by cabinets and limited in scope and in their aims. They also involved quickly shifting alliances, and mainly used mercenaries.

Over the course of the 18th-19th centuries all military arms and services underwent significant developments that included a more mobile [[field artillery]], the transition from use of battalion [[infantry drill]] in [[close order formation|close order]] to open order formations and the transfer of emphasis from the use of [[bayonets]] to the rifle that replaced the musket, and virtual replacement of all types of cavalry with the universal [[dragoons]], or [[mounted infantry]].

===Industrial warfare===
{{details|Industrial warfare}}
[[File:Bataille Lizaine.jpg|thumb|[[Franco-Prussian War]]]]
As weapons—particularly small arms—became easier to use, countries began to abandon a complete reliance on professional soldiers in favor of [[conscription]]. Technological advances became increasingly important; while the armies of the previous period had usually had similar weapons, the industrial age saw encounters such as the [[Battle of Sadowa]], in which possession of a more advanced technology played a decisive role in the outcome.

Conscription was employed in industrial warfare to increase the number of military personnel that were available for combat. This was notably used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and by almost all parties during the two World Wars.

[[Total war]] was used in industrial warfare, the objective being to prevent the opposing nation to engage in war. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s burning of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of enemy cities and industrial factories]] during [[World War II]] are examples of total warfare.

===Modern warfare===
{{Original research section|date=March 2016}}
{{details|Modern warfare}}

In modern times, war has evolved from an activity steeped in tradition to a [[scientific enterprise]] where success is valued above methods. The notion of [[total war]] is the extreme of this trend.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Militaries have developed technological advances rivaling the scientific accomplishments of any other field of study.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Modern militaries benefit in the development of these technologies under the funding of the [[public]], the leadership of [[Central government|national governments]]. What distinguishes modern military organizations from those previous is not their willingness to prevail in conflict by any method, but rather the technological variety of tools and methods available to modern [[battlefield]] commanders, from [[submarine]]s to [[satellite]]s, from knives to [[nuclear warheads]].

The '''New Alchemy Institute''' was a research center that did pioneering investigation into [[organic agriculture]], [[aquaculture]], and [[bioshelter]] design between 1969 and 1991. It was founded by [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Nancy Jack Todd, and William McLarney. Its purpose was to research human support systems of food, water, and shelter and to completely rethink how these systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Alastair|title=Remembering Jay Baldwin, experimental geodesic dome champion - Archpaper.com|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/04/remembering-jay-baldwin/|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=archpaper.com|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the Institute==

The New Alchemy Institute was founded on a {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}}, former dairy farm in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]]. Their stated aim was to do research on behalf of the planet: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Among our major tasks is the creation of ecologically derived human support systems - [[renewable energy]], agriculture [[aquaculture]], housing and landscapes. The strategies we research emphasize a minimal reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is to direct its course towards a greener, saner world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world are in the process of destroying it." (Fall 1970, Bulletin of the New Alchemists. [http://www.thegreencenter.net/newalchemy.html])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Areas of research==

===Bioshelters===

A [[bioshelter]] is a solar greenhouse that is managed as a self-contained [[ecosystem]].  The groupings of plants, animals, soil and insects are selected so that closed loops of life cycles, materials, water, and energy are created, and require minimal inputs from outside the system.  They emulate natural rhythms of growth and cycling of nutrients.

New Alchemy built several bioshelters:

* "The Ark" located at the property in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville, Massachusetts]], United States
* "The Ark" located at [[Little Pond, Prince Edward Island|Spry Point, Prince Edward Island]], Canada
* others

===Organic agriculture===
New Alchemy investigated the practices of organic agriculture for both field crops, and greenhouse growing. They researched intensive gardening, biological pest control, cover cropping, irrigation using fish pond water, perennial food crops, and tree crops.

===Aquaculture===
New Alchemy experimented with growing edible fish  in ponds in the bioshelters. The solar aquaculture ponds were  above-ground, translucent tanks. The fertile pond water was used for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses. This proved to be a successful way to raise edible fish, floating hydroponic crops, and irrigated greenhouse food crops.

==Ideological basis==
The scientists working at New Alchemy were determined to rethink how human support systems were designed. They looked to nature as the ultimate designer, using careful observation of natural cycles and processes as the template for creating truly sustainable systems.

==Publications==
The research conducted at New Alchemy was documented in a series of journals and technical bulletins.  A complete list is available at: [http://www.thegreencenter.net New Alchemy Institute]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8688">'''Phenomenology''' within [[psychology]] ('''phenomenological psychology''') is the psychological study of subjective experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy Leahy|first=Thomas|title=A History of Modern Psychology|year=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-017573-0|pages=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to psychological subject matter that has its roots in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|philosophical work]] of [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref name="Giorgi1"&gt;[[Amedeo Giorgi|Giorgi, Amedeo]]. (1970). ''Psychology as a Human Science.'' New York : Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Early phenomenologists such as Husserl, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] conducted philosophical investigations of consciousness in the early 20th century. Their critiques of [[psychologism]] and [[positivism]] later influenced at least two main fields of contemporary psychology: the phenomenological psychological approach of the [[Duquesne School]] (The [[Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology]]), including [[Amedeo Giorgi]]&lt;ref name="Giorgi1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giorgi2"&gt;[[Amedeo Giorgi|Giorgi, Amedeo]]. (2009). ''The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology.'' Duquesne University Press: Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Wertz]]; and the experimental approaches associated with [[Francisco Varela]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], [[Evan Thompson]], and others ([[Embodied cognition|embodied mind thesis]]). Other names associated with the movement include [[Jonathan Smith (psychologist)|Jonathan Smith]] ([[interpretative phenomenological analysis]]), [[Steinar Kvale]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]]. But "an even stronger influence on psychopathology came from Heidegger (1963), particularly through [[Alice Holzhey-Kunz|Kunz]] (1931), Blankenburg (1971), Tellenbach (1983), [[Ludwig Binswanger|Binswanger]] (1994), and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Albert|title=Existential a prioris and the phenomenology of schizophrenia|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–7|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A10-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303044508/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A10-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenological psychologists have also figured prominently in the history of the [[humanistic psychology]] movement.

The experiencing subject can be considered to be the [[person]] or [[self (psychology)|self]], for purposes of convenience. In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[philosophy]] (and in particular in the work of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Heidegger]], and [[Merleau-Ponty]]), "experience" is a considerably more complex concept than it is usually taken to be in everyday use. Instead, experience (or being, or existence itself) is an "in-relation-to" phenomenon, and it is defined by qualities of directedness, embodiment, and worldliness, which are evoked by the term "Being-in-the-World".&lt;ref name="Langdridge, D. 2006"&gt;Langdridge, D. (2006). Phenomenological psychology: theory, research and method. Harlow: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality or nature of a given experience is often referred to by the term [[qualia]], whose archetypical exemplar is "redness". For example, we might ask, "Is my experience of redness the same as yours?" While it is difficult to answer such a question in any concrete way, the concept of [[intersubjectivity]] is often used as a mechanism for understanding how it is that humans are able to empathise with one another's experiences, and indeed to engage in meaningful communication about them. The phenomenological formulation of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|Being-in-the-World]], where person and world are mutually constitutive, is central here.

==Difficulties in considering subjective phenomena==
The philosophical psychology prevalent before the end of the 19th century relied heavily on [[introspection]]. The speculations concerning the mind based on those observations were criticized by the pioneering advocates of a more scientific approach to psychology, such as [[William James]] and the behaviorists [[Edward Thorndike]], [[Clark Hull]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]. However, not everyone agrees that introspection is intrinsically problematic, such as [[Francisco Varela]], who has trained experimental participants in the structured "introspection" of [[phenomenological reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F.J. (1996). Neurophenomenology: a methodological remedy to the hard problem. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 3330-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Amedeo Giorgi applied phenomenological theory to his development of the Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology in order to overcome certain problems he perceived, from his work in psychophysics, with approaching subjective phenomena from the traditional hypothetical-deductive framework of the natural sciences. Giorgi hoped to use what he had learned from his natural science background to develop a rigorous qualitative research method. Giorgi has thus described his overall project as such: "[Phenomenological psychology] is nothing like natural sciences... because its [sic] [dealing with] human experiences and human phenomena. [However] I want to be sure that our criteria is this: that every natural scientist will have to respect our method. I'm not just trying to satisfy clinicians, or therapists, or humanists, I'm trying to satisfy the most severe criterion—natural scientists... because I anticipate that some day, when qualitative research develops and gets strong, the natural science people are going to criticize it. And I want to be able to stand up and say, 'Go ahead, criticize it—but you won't find any flaws here'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=485|title=Amedeo Giorgi: A Life in Phenomenology - PhenomenologyBlog|author=|date=|website=phenomenologyblog.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023180038/http://phenomenologyblog.com/?p=485|archivedate=23 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers have long confronted the problem of "[[qualia]]". Few philosophers believe that it is possible to be sure that one person's [[experience]] of the "redness" of an object is the same as another person's, even if both persons had effectively identical genetic and experiential histories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In principle, the same difficulty arises in [[feeling]]s (the subjective experience of emotion), in the experience of effort, and especially in the "meaning" of concepts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} As a result, many qualitative psychologists have claimed phenomenological inquiry to be essentially a matter of "[[meaning-making]]" and thus a question to be addressed by interpretive approaches.&lt;ref name="Langdridge, D. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1989). "Köhler's Dilemma", In ''Issues of Language Assessment''. vol 3. Ed., Stanley S.Seidner. Springfield, Il.: State Board of Education. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychotherapy and the phenomenology of emotion==
[[Carl Rogers]]' [[person-centered psychotherapy]] theory is based directly on the "[[phenomenal field theory|phenomenal field]]" personality theory of Combs and Snygg.&lt;ref&gt;Snygg, Donald and Combs, Arthur W. (1949), ''Individual Behavior: A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. (1951) ''Client-Centered Therapy''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; That theory in turn was grounded in phenomenological thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html "Personality Theories"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807230307/http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg%26combs.html |date=2007-08-07 }}, Boeree, C. George, Donald Snygg and Arthur Combs in ''Personality Theory'' retrieved Oct. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers attempts to put a therapist in closer contact with a person by listening to the person's report of their recent subjective experiences, especially emotions of which the person is not fully aware. For example, in relationships the problem at hand is often not based around what actually happened but, instead, based around the perceptions and feelings of each individual in the relationship. The phenomenal field focuses on "how one feels right now".

A '''polemic''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|ɪ|k}}) is contentious [[rhetoric]] that is intended to support a specific position by aggressive claims and undermining of the opposing position.  Polemics are mostly seen in arguments about controversial topics. The practice of such argumentation is called ''polemics''. A person who often writes polemics, or who speaks polemically, is called a ''polemicist''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (Merriam-Webster, Springfield, MA, 2005), s.v. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/polemic "polemic"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word is derived {{ety|gre|''πολεμικός'' (polemikos)|warlike, hostile}},&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American College Dictionary (Random House, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; {{ety||''πόλεμος'' (polemos)|war}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flemos πόλεμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemics often concern issues in [[religion]] or [[politics]]. A polemic style of writing was common in [[Ancient Greece]], as in the writings of the historian [[Polybius]]. Polemic again became common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times. Since then, famous polemicists have included the satirist [[Jonathan Swift]], Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], the socialist philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], the [[novelist]] [[George Orwell]], the psycholinguist [[Noam Chomsky]], the social critic [[Christopher Hitchens]], the existential philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], author of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality|On the Genealogy of Morality: A Polemic]]''.

==Overview==
Polemics are usually addressed to important issues in [[religion]] and [[politics]]. Polemic journalism was common in [[continental Europe]] at a time when [[libel]] laws were not as stringent as they are now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |title=polemic, or polemical literature, or polemics (rhetoric) |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411123116/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-467241/polemic |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To support the study of the controversies of the 17th–19th centuries, a British research project has placed online thousands of polemical pamphlets from that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/rarebooks/named/hayflemingcollection/ | title=Pamphlet and polemic: Pamphlets as a guide to the controversies of the 17th-19th centuries |publisher= St Andrews University Library| accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Discussions around [[atheism]], [[humanism]] and Christianity have remained capable of polemic into the 21st century; for example, in 2007 Brian McClinton argued in ''[[Humani (organisation)|Humani]]'' that anti-religious books such as [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' are part of the polemic tradition.&lt;ref name=McClinton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClinton|first1=Brian|title=A Defence of Polemics|journal=Humani|date=July 2007|issue=105|pages=12–13|url=http://humanistni.org/filestore/image/polemics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] published a book titled ''Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grayling|first1=A. C.|title=Against All Gods: Six Polemics on Religion and an Essay on Kindness|date=2008|publisher=Oberon Books|isbn=978-1-840-02728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Ancient Greece]], writing was characterised by what Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin called "strident adversariality" and "rationalistic aggressiveness", summed up by McClinton as polemic.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Sivin |first2=Nathan |title=The Way and the Word: Science and Medicine in Early China and Greece |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ancient historian [[Polybius]] practised "quite bitter self-righteous polemic" against some twenty philosophers, orators, and historians.&lt;ref name=Walbank&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walbank |first1=F. W. |title=Polemic in Polybius |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |date=1962 |volume=52 |issue=Parts 1 and 2 |pages=1–12 |jstor=297872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polemical writings were common in [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] times.&lt;ref name=Suerbaum&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suerbaum |first1=Almut |last2=Southcombe |first2=George |title=Polemic: Language as Violence in Medieval and Early Modern Discourse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFWrCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39 |year=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-07929-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Ages, polemic had a religious dimension, as in [[Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Jewish texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from converting to other religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chazan, Robert |title=Fashioning Jewish identity in medieval western Christendom |page=7 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages|Medieval Christian writings]] were also often polemical; for example in their disagreements on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tolan, John Victor |title=Medieval Christian perceptions of Islam |page=420 |publisher=Routledge |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]], famously nailed to the door of the church in [[Wittenburg]], was a powerful polemic launched against the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; [[Robert Carliell]]'s 1619 defence of the new [[Church of England]] and diatribe against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] – ''Britaine's glorie, or An allegoricall dreame with the exposition thereof: containing The Heathens infidelitie in religion...'' – took the form of a 250-line poem.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, "Carleill, Robert (fl. 1619)", rev. Reavley Gair (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4680. Retrieved 27 May 2017. Pay-walled.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major political polemicists of the 18th century include [[Jonathan Swift]], with pamphlets such as his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', and [[Edmund Burke]], with his attack on the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]].&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulin|first1=Tom|title=The Art of Criticism: 12 Polemic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-art-of-criticism-12-polemic-1612930.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 November 2016|date=26 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s 1848 ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' was extremely polemical.&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt; Friedrich Engels's famous work [[Anti-Dühring]] was also a polemic against [[Eugen Dühring]].

In the 20th century, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' was a polemic against [[totalitarianism]], in particular of [[Stalinism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].  According to McClinton, other prominent polemicists of the same century include such diverse figures as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Michael Moore]].&lt;ref name=McClinton/&gt;

The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a group of over 70 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the phase out of traditional or unabated coal power.

==History==
The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

Membership has grown rapidly. By the end of the summit membership was over 20 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="abcnet20"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056 |accessdate=29 September 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month membership had grown to over 50 countries, regions and organisations.&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50"&gt;{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance Membership Blows Out Past 50 |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/13/powering-past-coal-alliance-membership-blows-past-50/ |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018 membership stood at 74: 29 countries, 17 regions and 28 organisations.&lt;ref name="nrdc74"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Climate Action Summit: A World Moving Beyond Coal |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/global-climate-action-summit-world-moving-beyond-coal |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 the South Korean province of [[South Chungcheong]] became the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.&lt;ref name="ccnSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korean province joins international coal phase-out club |url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/10/03/south-korean-province-joins-international-coal-phaseout-club/ |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrdsSChungcheong"&gt;{{cite web |title=Korean Province to Phase Out Coal: Implications for Asia |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/korean-province-phase-out-coal-implications-asia |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Alliance members agree that:&lt;ref name="cleantechnica50" /&gt;

* Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power.
* Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.

'''Public opinion on global warming''' is the aggregate of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] or [[belief]]s held by the adult population concerning the science, economics, and politics of [[global warming]]. It is affected by [[media coverage of climate change]].

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that a knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.&lt;ref name="Pelham2009Awareness"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe and Japan, 90% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat" /&gt;

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online survey on environmental questions conducted in 20 countries by Ipsos MORI, "Global Trends 2014", shows broad agreement, especially on climate change and if it is caused by humans, though the U.S. ranked lowest with 54% agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/environment.html|title=Global Trends 2014|author=Ipsos MORI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223081447/http://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/environment.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the low U.S. ranking is tied to [[Climate change denial#Denial networks|denial campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/07/climate-denial-us-uk-australia-canada-english|title=The Strange Relationship Between Global Warming Denial and…Speaking English|date=July 22, 2014|author=MotherJones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 survey of 14 [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] found that [[Climate change skeptics|skepticism]] about the danger of global warming was highest in Australia, Norway, New Zealand and the United States, in that order, correlating positively with [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|per capita emissions of carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tranter|first1=Bruce|last2=Booth|first2=Kate|title=Scepticism in a Changing Climate: A Cross-national Study|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=July 2015|volume=33|pages=54–164|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States====
{{further|Climate change in the United States}}
In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's 'Six Americas'. The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warning: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action. The theory of the 'Six Americas' is also used for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-2009/|title=Global Warming’s Six Americas 2009|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions in the United States vary intensely enough to be considered a [[culture war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/science/earth/americans-link-global-warming-to-extreme-weather-poll-says.html | work=The New York Times | first=Justin | last=Gillis | title=Americans Link Global Warming to Extreme Weather, Poll Says | date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/climate_science_as_culture_war ''Climate Science as Culture War: The public debate around climate change is no longer about science&amp;nbsp;– it’s about values, culture, and ideology''] Fall 2012 [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.&lt;ref name="Riffkin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017. A poll taken in 2016 shows that 52% of Americans believe climate change to be [[causes of global warming|caused by human activity]], while 34% state it is caused by natural changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&amp;type=value&amp;geo=county|title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps - U.S. 2016 - Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|work=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is increasingly showing that 62 percent of Americans believe that the [[effects of global warming]] are happening now in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx|title=Global Warming Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Gallup (company)|GALLUP]] found that 64% of Americans are worried about global warming, 59% believed that global warming is already happening and 65% is convinced that global warming is caused by human activities. These numbers show that awareness of global warming is increasing in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx|title=U.S. Concern About Global Warming at Eight-Year High|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=25 April 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.&lt;ref name=gap&gt;[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]&lt;/ref&gt; However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries" /&gt; In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer2009p13" /&gt; However, a survey of American adults found that "...there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Kahan| first =Dan| title =Climate-Science Communication and the Measurement Problem| journal =Advances in Political Psychology| volume =36| issue =s1| pages =1–43| date =20 February 2015| url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12244/full| doi =10.1111/pops.12244| accessdate =26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Climate Science Literacy Unrelated to Public Acceptance of Human-Caused Global Warming| website =Yale Law School| date =23 February 2015| url =http://www.law.yale.edu/news/19377.htm| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150326010101/http://www.law.yale.edu/news/19377.htm| dead-url =yes| archivedate =26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Lott| first =Maxim| title =Study: Global warming skeptics know more about climate science| newspaper =Fox News| date =12 February 2015| url =http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/02/12/study-global-warming-skeptics-know-more-about-climate-science/| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries" /&gt;

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Pelham2009Energy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both "poverty, lack of food and drinking water" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer2009p13"&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, conservative white men are more likely than other Americans to deny climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCright|first1=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=October 2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–72|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.&lt;ref name="Hüne"&gt;Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.&lt;ref name="Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a "marvelous excuse for supranational socialism," and called Al Gore an "apocalyptic hyperbole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007"&gt;{{cite journal | first1= M. A. | last1= Schreurs | first2= Y. | last2= Tiberghien | date=Nov 2007 | title = Multi-Level Reinforcement: Explaining European Union Leadership in Climate Change Mitigation | journal = [[Global Environmental Politics]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 19–46 | doi = 10.1162/glep.2007.7.4.19 | issn = 1526-3800 | url = http://www.fulbright.de/fileadmin/files/togermany/information/2007-08/German_Studies_Seminar/Explaining_EU_Leadership_in_Climate_CHange_Mitigation_by_Ms._Schreurs__PhD_and_Mr._Tiberghien__PhD.pdf | format = Full free text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, a 2013 poll conducted by [[TNS Gallup]] found that 92% of those who vote for the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and 89% of those who vote for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] believe that global warming is caused by humans, while the percentage who held this belief is 60% among voters for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and 41% among voters for the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Among those who vote for the Liberal Party or the Socialist Party, the great majority think that humans are behind climate changes (89 and 92%). Only 41% of those who vote for the Progress Party agree, while the number for Conservative Party voters is 60%." (Translated from Norwegian to English) Liv Jorun Andenes and Amalie Kvame Holm: [http://www.vl.no/helg/godt-klima-for-skepsis/ Typisk norsk å være klimaskeptisk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708104143/http://www.vl.no/helg/godt-klima-for-skepsis/ |date=8 July 2013 }} {{no icon}} [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|''Vårt Land'']], retrieved 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so "primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in "[[attention economy]]", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp 133-150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged “shield” meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including “Hollywood affinities.” These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared. (Sheldon Ungar 2000)&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;}}

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance. In case of the public opinion on climate change, no imminent danger is perceived.&lt;ref name=Ungar&gt;Knowledge, ignorance and the popular culture: climate change versus the ozone hole, by Sheldon Ungar, {{doi|10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/306}} Public Understanding of Science July 2000 vol. 9 no. 3 297–312 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140908033209/http://pus.sagepub.com/content/9/3/297.short Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 BBC World Service poll found that when asked about various policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - tax incentives for alternative energy research and development, installment of taxes to encourage energy conservation, and reliance on nuclear energy to reduce fossil fuels. The majority of those asked felt that tax incentives were the path of action that they preferred.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump’s Views on Climate Change?

==Issues==
===Science===
{{See also|Scientific opinion on climate change}}
A [[scientific consensus]] on climate change exists, as recognized by national [[Academy of Sciences|academies of science]] and other authoritative bodies.&lt;ref name="JointScienceAcademies2005" /&gt;  The opinion gap between scientists and the public in 2009 stands at 84% to 49% that global temperatures are increasing because of human-activity.&lt;ref name="PewResearchCenter2009PublicPraiseScientistsFault"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/528.pdf|title=Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media|date=9 Jun 2009|pages=5, 55|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research has identified substantial geographical variation in the public's understanding of the scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baobao|last2=van der Linden|first2=Sander|last3=Mildenberger||first3=Matto|last4=Marlon|first4=Jennifer|last5=Howe|first5=Peter|last6=Leiserowitz|first6=Anthony|title=Experimental effects of climate messages vary geographically|journal=Nature Climate Change|date=2018|volume=21|doi=10.1038/s41558-018-0122-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
{{See also|Media coverage of climate change}}

The popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to skeptics relative to the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| first2 = J. | title = Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press| last1 = Boykoff | journal = Global Environmental Change Part A | volume = 14| issue =  2 | pages = 125–36 | date = July 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001| last2 =  Boykoff| url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003| title = Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.2033&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| year = 2005| last1 = Antilla | first1 = L.| journal = Global Environmental Change Part A| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 338–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US popular media coverage differs from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1108/01443330310790327 | title = Media's social construction of environmental issues: focus on global warming – a comparative study | year = 2003 | last1 = Dispensa | first1 = J.

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.&lt;ref name="Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.   According to a 2013 Gallup US opinion poll, 57% believe global warming is at least as bad as portrayed in the media (with 33% thinking media has downplayed global warming and 24% saying coverage is accurate).  Less than half of Americans (41%) think the problem is not as bad as media portrays it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saad|first=Lydia|title=Americans' Concerns About Global Warming on the Rise|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/161645/americans-concerns-global-warming-rise.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September 2011 [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] poll found that Britons (43%) are less likely than Americans (49%) or Canadians (52%) to say that "global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities."

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.&lt;ref name="LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006"&gt;{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

Public support for action to forestall global warming is as strong as public support has been historically for many other government actions; however, it is not "intense" in the sense that it overrides other priorities.&lt;ref name="LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fix36-46&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Pielke, Jr.|authorlink1=Roger A.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between "poverty, the lack of food and drinking water" and "a major global economic downturn." 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a "serious" or "very serious" problem, while 10% "do not consider it a serious problem." However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, "climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes."&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007" /&gt; Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns. However the drop in concern in 2008 is unique compared to other environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Saad2009GlobalWarmingExaggerated" /&gt; Considered in the context of environmental issues, Americans consider global warming as a less critical concern than the pollution of rivers, lakes, and drinking water; toxic waste; fresh water needs; air pollution; damage to the ozone layer; and the loss of tropical rain forests.

[[File:Shinshu univ ueda koudou2.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Textile Science and Technology Auditorium. Cultural property. Construction 1929.]]
In September 2005, the university chair decided not to participate in national or international rankings in the foreseeable future, stating the administrative expenditures needed as a main reason. The small sample size used by many rankings and their methodology have also been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrance ceremony President Greetings|publisher=Atsushi Komiyama|url=http://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/guidance/president/|date=September 21, 2005|accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Shinshu University is still being featured in international rankings.

The '''''Software Engineering Body of Knowledge''''' ('''SWEBOK''') is an international standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897|title=ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying a guide to the generally accepted Software Engineering Body of Knowledge.

The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) has been created through cooperation among several professional bodies and members of industry and is published by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] ([[IEEE]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Guide to the software engineering body of knowledge : 2004 version," Library of Congress Online Catalog, 2005, http://lccn.loc.gov/2005921729. Retrieved 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard can be accessed freely from the [[IEEE Computer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok/home |title=SWEBOK |publisher=Computer.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013, SWEBOK V3 was approved for publication and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/pressroom/New-Version-of-Guide-to-the-Software-Engineering-Body-of-Knowledge-Approved |title=New Version of Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Approved | accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the IEEE Computer Society kicked off the SWEBoK Evolution effort to develop future iterations of the body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computer.org/web/peb/swebok-evolution |title=SWEBoK Evolution | accessdate=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SWEBOK Version 3==
The published version of SWEBOK V3 has the following 15 [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:

* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* [[Software engineering management]]
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering]] models and methods
* [[Software quality]]
* [[Software engineering professional practice]]
* [[Software engineering economics]]
* Computing foundations
* Mathematical foundations
* Engineering foundations

It also recognized, but did not define, these related disciplines:

* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Systems engineering]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* General [[management]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Mathematics]]

== 2004 Edition of the SWEBOK ==
The 2004 edition of the SWEBOK guide defined ten [[knowledge area]]s (KAs) within the field of [[software engineering]]:
* [[Software requirements]]
* [[Software design]]
* [[Software construction]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Software maintenance]]
* [[Software configuration management]]
* Software engineering management ([[Engineering management]])
* [[Software engineering process]]
* [[Software engineering tools and methods]]
* [[Software quality]]

The SWEBOK also defines disciplines related to software engineering:
* [[Computer engineering]]
* [[Computer science]]
* [[Management]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Quality management]]
* Software ergonomics ([[Cognitive ergonomics]])
* [[Systems engineering]]

== Similar Efforts ==
A similar effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering is the "Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)," officially named [[Software Engineering 2004]] (SE2004). The curriculum largely overlaps with the 2004 SWEBOK V2 because the SWEBOK has been used as one of its sources; however, it is more directed towards academia. Whereas the [[SWEBOK]] Guide defines the [[software engineering]] knowledge that practitioners should have after four years of practice, SE2004 defines the knowledge that an [[undergraduate]] software engineering student should possess upon graduation (including knowledge of mathematics, general engineering principles, and other related areas). SWEBOK V3 aims to address these intersections.

The '''State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry''' ('''SUNY-ESF''', or '''ESF''') is an American, specialized, doctoral-granting institution based in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is immediately adjacent to [[Syracuse University]], within which it was founded, and with whom it maintains a special relationship. ESF is a part of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system. ESF also operates facilities in the [[Adirondack Park]] (including the [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York|Wanakena]]), the [[Thousand Islands]], elsewhere in central New York, and [[Costa Rica]]. The College's curricula focus on the understanding, [[natural resource management|management]] and [[sustainability]] of the environment and natural resources. ESF is considered by [[Peterson's]] to be the premier college in the U.S. for the study of environmental and natural sciences, design, engineering, policy and management of natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/college-search/state-university-of-new-york-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry-000_10000544.aspx|title=State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|publisher=Peterson's|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has expanded its initial emphasis on forestry to include professional education in environmental science, landscape architecture, environmental studies, and engineering in addition to distinguished programs in the biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"/&gt; ESF is ranked at 43rd in the 2017 ''US News &amp; World Report'' rankings of the top public national universities.&lt;ref name=usnwr2019 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/suny-environmental-science-and-forestry-2851|title=SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry - Best College - US News|publisher=|accessdate=13 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorated its centennial in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/centennial/ |title=SUNY-ESF Centennial Celebration |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|History of the New York State College of Forestry}}

=== Founding ===

The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[John Alden Dix]]. The previous year, Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, A.D. ''Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills followed the state's defunding, in 1903, of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf |format=PDF |title=Roots of American Forestry Education |website=Foresthistory.org |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a unit of [[Syracuse University]], in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill [[Forest Preserve (New York)]], became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135440/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herbert Alpert| title = Louis Marshall: 1856-1929| date = 2008-11-03| isbn = 978-0-595-48230-6| page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Marshall,"Champion of Liberty", selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957. Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dean of the College was [[William L. Bray]], a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/ecology/aepsp3.html |title=American Environmental Photographs, 1891-1936 - Ecology and the American Environment (American Memory from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of [[Gifford Pinchot]], who was the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William L. Bray| title = Forest resources of Texas| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wrQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1| year = 1904| publisher = U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of Forestry| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/org/knothole/The_Knothole/Archive_files/Volume%2061,%20Issue%209.pdf The Knothole: Student Life and Government]". April 4, 2008. Volume 61 Issue 9. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/BRAY1865.htm Chrono-Biographical Sketch: William Bray]". A Biographical History of Biogeography by Charles H. Smith, Ph.D., Joshua Woleben, and Carubie Rodgers/ Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published ''The Development of the Vegetation of New York State'', he became one of the founding members, along with [[Raphael Zon]] and [[Yale School of Forestry]]'s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/ |title=The Ecological Society of America's History and Records – by the ESA Historical Records Committee |publisher=Esa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the 1917 "activist wing" of that Society formed today's [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html |title=New York Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325075148/http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html# |archive-date=2010-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/pressroom/ip/press/forests.html |title=Conservation &amp; Green News &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the professors, in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell's [[New York State College of Agriculture]] were educated in forestry at the [[Yale School of Forestry]]. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as "stumpies" by their classmates.

Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school's first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities.

=== Expansion ===

In 1912, the College opened its [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York]], in the [[Adirondacks]]. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees—one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper—graduated in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/history.htm A History of ESF]". SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930, Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college's second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: "under [Marshall's] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, [[F. Franklin Moon|Franklin Moon]], the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Cyrus, "Louis Marshall: A Biographical Sketch", American Jewish Year Book, 1930-31, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate [[Alfred E. Smith]] who was elected to assume the presidency of the college's Board of Trustees.

=== Affiliation with SUNY ===

With the formation of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2009-07-09| author=Peter D.

ESF's main campus, located in [[Syracuse, New York]], is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. The campus is made up of nine main buildings:

* '''Baker Laboratory''': Named after [[Hugh P. Baker]], Dean of the College from 1912–1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several [[computer cluster]]s and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. The building underwent a $37 million overhaul in the early 2000s, providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the [[Nelson C. Brown]] Center for Ultrastructure Studies. Baker Lab is the site of ESF's NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a "smart" classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/communications/news/2000/03.29.baker.htm ESF's Baker Laboratory Revamped for Engineering]". ESF Office of Communications. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bray Hall''': The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after [[William L. Bray]], a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management. The [[New York State University Police|State University Police]] department is located in the basement.
* '''Gateway Center''': The campus' newest building, opened in March 2013, "sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes," according to [[Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr.]] The building is "designed to achieve LEED Platinum Certification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=415 |title=SUNY-ESF Breaks Ground for Gateway Building |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "Gateway Building" (with webcam), SUNY-ESF.] Accessed: June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESF College Bookstore, Trailhead Cafe, and Office of Admissions are located in the Gateway Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "The Gateway Center"], ESF website. Accessed: October 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illick Hall''': The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after [[Joseph S. Illick]], a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) on the ground floor. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building.
* '''Jahn Laboratory''': Named after [[Edwin C. Jahn]], former head of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building was completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.
* '''Marshall Hall''': Named after [[Louis Marshall]], one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni ([[Eustace B. Nifkin|Nifkin]]) Lounge, Tree House (snack bar) and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]].
* '''Moon Library''': Dedicated to [[F. Franklin Moon]], an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement.
* '''Walters Hall''': Named after [[J. Henry Walters]], who served on the College's Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.
*'''Centennial Hall''': ESF's on-campus student [[dormitory]], named in commemoration of the college's 100th anniversary. The facility is capable of accommodating 280-300 freshman (in double or triple studio rooms with private bath), 116 upperclassmen (in single bedroom suits with private bath), and an additional 56 upperclassmen (in 4-bedroom, 2-bath apartments). A $31 million project, Centennial Hall opened in fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centennial Hall|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/centennial.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. Other buildings on the Syracuse campus include one for maintenance and operations, a garage, and a greenhouse converted to office space. Among planned new buildings is a research support facility.

The historic Robin Hood Oak (photo below) is located behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Campus life==
[[File:ESF-Robinhood-Oak-2014.jpg|thumb|200px|The 'Robin Hood Oak' (''[[Quercus robur|Q. robur]]''), direct descendant of [[Major Oak]], of [[Sherwood Forest]], England&lt;ref&gt;Interpretive sign, SUNY-ESF&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many students identify themselves as a "Stumpy" (or "Stumpie"). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry "stump jumpers". Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.

Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/org/axs/ "Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,"] SUNY-ESF website. Accessed: August 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Soccer Team, [[Sigma Lambda Alpha (honor society)|Sigma Lambda Alpha]], ''The Knothole'' (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, ''The Empire Forester'' (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, [[Habitat for Humanity]], ''Ecologue'' (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, Baobab Society, and the Sustainable Energy Club. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the [[Society of American Foresters]], [[The Wildlife Society]], [[Conservation biology|Conservation Biology]] club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association.

ESF has an agreement with adjacent [[Syracuse University]] that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the [[Carrier Dome]]. ESF's baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University.

Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and nearby [[Marshall Street, Syracuse|Marshall Street]] and [[Westcott, Syracuse|Westcott Street]].

== Gateway Center ==
ESF has launched several programs, both within the confines of campus and other locations to reduce its [[carbon emission]]s. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses [[biomass]] to drive a [[steam turbine]] and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF's carbon footprint by 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gateway Center|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ESF-Gateway-Green-Roof-2014.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Gateway Center's [[green roof|green roof/ garden]] (foreground)]]

Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass.  Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shijie|author2=Abrahamson, L. |author3=Scott, G. |title=Biorefinery: Ensuring biomass as a sustainable renewable source of chemicals, materials, and energy|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|year=2012|volume=39|issue=April|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment.  For this reason, SUNY-ESF has launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the ''[[Willow Biomass Project]]''. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Willow Biomass Project|url=http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/willow/willow.htm|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school's ''Climate Action Plan'', that encompasses the vision of [[carbon neutrality]] and reduced [[fossil fuel]] dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heavey|first=Justin|title=Climate Action Plan for SUNY ESF|year=2009|publisher=Department of Renewable Energy Systems|page=6,21|author2=Kelleher, Michael |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus's buildings. [[Green roof|Rooftop gardens]] provide reduced [[energy consumption]] and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased [[energy conservation|energy savings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=N.

=== Athletics history ===

In one notable part of the College's history, [[Laurie D. Cox]], professor of [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], was responsible for establishing [[Syracuse University]]'s renowned [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|lacrosse program]] in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry.&lt;ref name =father&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118716843.html|title=Cox began lacrosse legacy at Syracuse|last=Herron|first=Frank|date=June 27, 2004|publisher=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY)|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliation with Syracuse University==
ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206063046/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]], although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well.

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/esfsu.htm |title=The ESF-SU Relationship |publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as [[frisbee]] and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad.

Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for ''The Knothole'', and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.

Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

'''Sumac Kawsay'''  ''Buen Vivir''  ("good living") rooted in the cosmovisión (or worldview) of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples of the Andes, sumak kawsay – or buen vivir, to give it its Spanish name – describes a way of doing things that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"&gt;Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. Southern California Law Review 1972;45:450; W Kaufmann, Los Altos, 1974 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000 animals, plants and other organisms have their rights to dignity recognised by the Constitution in Switzerland (art. 120), but the implications of this disposition are still not very clear. With the enactment of [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|its 2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71–74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of [[ecosystems]] to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

==History==
{{Further|Plant rights|Environmental movement}}

=== Rights of nature in legal history ===
In his famous work, "Should Trees Have Standing?", Christopher Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, as a rights-holder the natural object would “have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’”. To achieve rights-holder status, the natural object must satisfy three criteria: [First], that the thing can institute legal actions at its behest; second, that in determining the granting of legal relief, the court must take injury to it into account; and third, that relief must run to the benefit of it.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"/&gt;

In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case, ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that "inanimate objects" should have standing to sue in court: {{quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.&lt;ref name=405US727&gt;{{Cite court|title=a|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/727/case.html#741|year=1972|accessdate=October 8, 2011|court=USSC|litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton|opinion=727|pinpoint=741–43|reporter=U.S.|vol=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Douglas continued: {{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a [[Legal fiction|fiction]] found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]]{{mdash}}a creature of ecclesiastical law{{mdash}}is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases.... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes{{mdash}}fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.&lt;ref name=405US727 /&gt;}}

===Outcome from neoliberal development in Ecuador===

The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "''Buen Vivir''" or good living, which focuses on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth, gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of ''Buen Vivir'' originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of ''Buen Vivir''.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal development schemes in line with the "[[Washington Consensus]]" did not create prosperity for much of Ecuador's population, especially its [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|indigenous population]]s, who make up about 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Acosta"&gt;Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Martínez, and Joseph H. Vogel

Americas Program Policy Report.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madden"&gt;Madden, Christina L. 2008 Laws Gone Wild in Ecuador: Indigenous People and Ecosystems Gain Rights. Policy Innovations. http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000077&lt;/ref&gt; The economy, based on the exportation of the country's raw materials, mainly oil, was also wreaking havoc on the nation's environment, an area with valuable biological and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Arsel"&gt;Arsel, Murat 2012. Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography) 103(2):150-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

===''Buen Vivir''===

''Buen Vivir'' ("good living") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. ''Buen Vivir'' is an alternative concept of development that focuses on the attainment of the "good life" in a broad sense, only attainable within a community; a community that includes Nature. A popular approach to ''Buen Vivir'' is the Ecuadorian concept of ''[[w:es:sumak kawsay|sumak kawsay]]'', meaning a full life in [[kichwa]]. Part of this concept also emphasizes living in harmony with other people and nature. ''Buen Vivir'' has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of [[South America]] and evolving as a multicultural concept. Social consensus led to the inclusion of ''Buen Vivir'' in Ecuador's new constitution, supported as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines ''Buen Vivir'' as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; In line with the assertion of these rights, ''Buen Vivir'' changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SENPLADES"&gt;SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous movement===

The inclusion of "Buen Vivir" and Rights of Nature in the constitution was ushered in largely due to the increased influence of indigenous activist groups in the political realm. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global [[climate change]], started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. [[CONAIE]] (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements, encompassing 14 of the nation's indigenous groups, and other groups focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''[[Pachamama]]'' (English: "Mother Nature").&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

===Drafting===
President [[Rafael Correa]] included calling for a constitutional assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; To create a constitution based on the principles of ''Buen Vivir'', the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the [[Pachamama]] Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt; Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundación Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;Fundación Pachamama (FP). 2011 [http://www.derechosdelanaturaleza.org/website/files/2011/01/Recogniting-Rights-for-Nature-in-the-Ecuadorian-Constitution-Fundacion-Pachamama1.pdf "Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
On September 28, 2008, a mandatory [[referendum]] was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Gar. 2009, "In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights", ''Earth Island Journal'' 23(4):15-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Rights of Nature==

===Title II===

===Rights===

===Chapter one===

===Principles for the enforcement of rights===

'''Article 10.''' Persons, communities, peoples, nations and communities are bearers of rights and shall enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and in international instruments.
Nature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it.

===Chapter seven===

===Rights of nature===

'''Article 71.''' Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.
All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate.
The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.

'''Article 72.''' Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.
In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences.

'''Article 73.''' The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles.
The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.

'''Article 74.''' Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living.
Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.&lt;ref name="PDBA"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html "2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or ''Pachamama'', as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt;
 
The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''Pachamama'', as well as recognized the [[plurinationality]] of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko"&gt;Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center.&lt;/ref&gt; By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and [[mitigation of climate change]], and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.&lt;ref name="SENPLADES" /&gt;

===Legal effects===
The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives.

====Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja====
''Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja'' was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an [[environmental impact assessment]] or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, Erin. 2012, [http://celdf.live2.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/The_Ecuadorian_Exemplar_The_First_Ever_Vindications_of_Constitutional_Rights_of_Nature.pdf "Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'' 21(1): 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====República del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisión de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales====
In March 2011, right after the ruling on the ''Wheeler'' case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

====Yasuni ITT initiative====
The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the [[Yasuni National Park]], is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights.&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the [[European Union]] [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Praise===
The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt; Others also feel a major weakness of the constitution is that it does not require prior or informed consent by communities before the start of development projects, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt; There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect [[foreign direct investment]] since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt;

'''Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems''' generalize standard '''[[fuzzy sets|Type-1 fuzzy sets]] and [[fuzzy sets and systems|systems]]''' so that more uncertainty can be handled. From the very beginning of fuzzy sets, criticism was made about the fact that the membership function of a type-1 fuzzy set has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word ''fuzzy'', since that word has the connotation of lots of uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Prof. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref name="[27]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1," ''Information Sciences'', vol. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–249, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a '''''type-2 fuzzy set'''''. A type-2 fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into fuzzy set theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on. And, if there is no uncertainty, then a type-2 fuzzy set reduces to a type-1 fuzzy set, which is analogous to probability reducing to determinism when unpredictability vanishes.

In order to symbolically distinguish between a type-1 fuzzy set and a type-2 fuzzy set, a tilde symbol is put over the symbol for the fuzzy set; so, A denotes a type-1 fuzzy set, whereas Ã denotes the comparable type-2 fuzzy set. When the latter is done, the resulting type-2 fuzzy set is called a '''''general type-2 fuzzy set''''' (to distinguish it from the special interval type-2 fuzzy set).

Prof. Zadeh didn't stop with type-2 fuzzy sets, because in that 1976 paper&lt;ref name="[27]" /&gt; he also generalized all of this to type-''n'' fuzzy sets. The present article focuses only on type-2 fuzzy sets because they are the ''next step'' in the logical progression from type-1 to type-''n'' fuzzy sets, where ''n'' = 1, 2, … . Although some researchers are beginning to explore higher than type-2 fuzzy sets, as of early 2009, this work is in its infancy.

[[Image:MF of general T2 FS.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 1. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional. A cross-section of one slice of the third dimension is shown. This cross-section, as well as all others, sits on the FOU. Only the boundary of the cross-section is used to describe the membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set. It is shown filled-in for artistic purposes.]]
The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set, Ã, is three-dimensional (Fig. 1), where the third dimension is the value of the membership function at each point on its two-dimensional domain that is called its '''''footprint of uncertainty''''' (FOU).

For an interval type-2 fuzzy set that third-dimension value is the same (e.g., 1) everywhere, which means that no new information is contained in the third dimension of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. So, for such a set, the third dimension is ignored, and only the FOU is used to describe it. It is for this reason that an interval type-2 fuzzy set is sometimes called a ''first-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model, whereas a general type-2 fuzzy set (with its useful third-dimension) is sometimes referred to as a ''second-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model.

[[Image:FOU for IT2 FS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2. FOU for an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Many other shapes are possible for the FOU.]]
The FOU represents the blurring of a type-1 membership function, and is completely described by its two bounding functions (Fig. 2), a lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF), both of which are type-1 fuzzy sets! Consequently, it is possible to use type-1 fuzzy set mathematics to characterize and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that engineers and scientists who already know type-1 fuzzy sets will not have to invest a lot of time learning about general type-2 fuzzy set mathematics in order to understand and use interval type-2 fuzzy sets.

Work on type-2 fuzzy sets languished during the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990's, although a small number of articles were published about them. People were still trying to figure out what to do with type-1 fuzzy sets, so even though Zadeh proposed type-2 fuzzy sets in 1976, the time was not right for researchers to drop what they were doing with type-1 fuzzy sets to focus on type-2 fuzzy sets. This changed in the latter part of the 1990s as a result of Prof. Jerry Mendel and his student's works on type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.&lt;ref name="[12]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, ''Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions'', Prentice-Hall, Upper-Saddle River, NJ, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more and more researchers around the world are writing articles about type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.

==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets==
Interval type-2 fuzzy sets have received the most attention because the mathematics that is needed for such sets—primarily [[Interval arithmetic]]—is much simpler than the mathematics that is needed for general type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the literature about interval type-2 fuzzy sets is large, whereas the literature about general type-2 fuzzy sets is much smaller. Both kinds of fuzzy sets are being actively researched by an ever-growing number of researchers around the world and have resulted in successful employment in variety of domains such as robot control.&lt;ref name=hassanzadeh&gt;Hassanzadeh, Hamid Reza, et al. "An interval-valued fuzzy controller for complex dynamical systems with application to a 3-PSP parallel robot." Fuzzy sets and systems 235 (2014): 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems==
Type-2 fuzzy sets are finding very wide applicability in '''''rule-based fuzzy logic systems''''' (FLSs) because they let uncertainties be modeled by them whereas such uncertainties cannot be modeled by type-1 fuzzy sets. A block diagram of a type-2 FLS is depicted in Fig. 3. This kind of FLS is used in fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is sometimes referred to as a ''function approximation'' application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function.

[[Image:T2 FLS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3. Type-2 FLS]]

The following discussions, about the four components in the Fig. 3 rule-based FLS, are given for an interval type-2 FLS, because to-date they are the most popular kind of type-2 FLS; however, most of the discussions are also applicable for a general type-2 FLS.

'''''Rules''''', that are either provided by subject experts or are extracted from numerical data, are expressed as a collection of IF-THEN statements, e.g.,

:IF temperature is ''moderate'' and pressure is ''high'', then rotate the valve ''a bit to the right''.

Fuzzy sets are associated with the terms that appear in the antecedents (IF-part) or consequents (THEN-part) of rules, and with the inputs to and the outputs of the FLS. Membership functions are used to describe these fuzzy sets, and in a type-1 FLS they are all type-1 fuzzy sets, whereas in an interval type-2 FLS at least one membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set.

An interval type-2 FLS lets any one or all of the following kinds of uncertainties be quantified:

# Words that are used in antecedents and consequents of rules—because words can mean different things to different people.
# Uncertain consequents—because when rules are obtained from a group of experts, consequents will often be different for the same rule, i.e. the experts will not necessarily be in agreement.
# Membership function parameters—because when those parameters are optimized using uncertain (noisy) training data, the parameters become uncertain.
# Noisy measurements—because very often it is such measurements that activate the FLS.

In Fig. 3, measured (crisp) inputs are first transformed into fuzzy sets in the '''''Fuzzifier''''' block because it is fuzzy sets and not numbers that activate the rules which are described in terms of fuzzy sets and not numbers. Three kinds of fuzzifiers are possible in an interval type-2 FLS. When measurements are:
* Perfect, they are modeled as a crisp set;  
* Noisy, but the noise is stationary, they are modeled as a type-1 fuzzy set; and,
* Noisy, but the noise is non-stationary, they are modeled as an interval type-2 fuzzy set (this latter kind of fuzzification cannot be done in a type-1 FLS).

In Fig. 3, after measurements are fuzzified, the resulting input fuzzy sets are mapped into fuzzy output sets by the '''''Inference''''' block. This is accomplished by first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, with the help of an inference mechanism. If there are ''M'' rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than ''M'' rules. Inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more ''fired-rule fuzzy output sets''.

In most engineering applications of a FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent of the rule given above is "Rotate the valve a bit to the right." No automatic valve will know what this means because "a bit to the right" is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by a certain number of degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 '''''Output Processing''''' block.

In a type-1 FLS, output processing, called '''''[[Defuzzification]]''''', maps a type-1 fuzzy set into a number. There are many ways for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute the center of gravity of the membership function for that set; compute a weighted average of the center of gravities of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc.

Things are somewhat more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because to go from an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called '''''type-reduction''''', is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval-valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 defuzzification methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel&lt;ref name="[7]" /&gt;&lt;ref name="[12]" /&gt; now known as the '''''KM Algorithm''''' is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast.

The second step of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called '''''defuzzification'''''. Because a type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy set is always a finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just the average of the two end-points of this interval.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that there can be two outputs to an interval type-2 FLS—crisp numerical values and the type-reduced set. The latter provides a measure of the uncertainties that have flowed through the interval type-2 FLS, due to the (possibly) uncertain input measurements that have activated rules whose antecedents or consequents or both are uncertain. Just as standard deviation is widely used in probability and statistics to provide a measure of unpredictable uncertainty about a mean value, the type-reduced set can provided a measure of uncertainty about the crisp output of an interval type-2 FLS.

==Computing with words==
Another application for fuzzy sets has also been inspired by Prof. Zadeh&lt;ref name="[28]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "Fuzzy logic = computing with words," ''IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems'', vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–111, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[29]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "From computing with numbers to computing with words—from manipulation of measurements to manipulation of perceptions," ''IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems–1, Fundamental Theory and Applications'', vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–119, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[30]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "Toward human level machine intelligence—is it achievable? The need for a new paradigm shift," ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–22, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; — '''''Computing With Words'''''. Different acronyms have been used for "computing with words," e.g., CW and CWW. According to Zadeh:
:CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. 
Of course, he did not mean that computers would actually compute using words—single words or phrases—rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets and that these fuzzy sets would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other fuzzy set after which the latter would be converted back into a word. A natural question to ask is: Which kind of fuzzy set—type-1 or type-2—should be used as a model for a word? Mendel&lt;ref name="[13]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, "Fuzzy Sets for Words: a New Beginning," ''Proc. IEEE FUZZ Conference'', St. Louis, MO, May 26–28, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[16]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, "Computing with words: Zadeh, Turing, Popper and Occam," ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–17, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued, on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s concept of '''''[[Falsificationism]]''''',&lt;ref name="[19]"&gt;K. Popper, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' (translation of Logik der Forschung), Hutchinson, London, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[30]" /&gt; that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is under way about CWW.

== Applications ==

==History==
Vatterott College was founded in 1969 in St. Louis, MO by John C. Vatterott Sr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/travel/travels-with-amy/new-haven-offers-an-art-filled-retreat-close-to-home/article_0076e6aa-67bc-58d1-8efc-b7a95f024a4c.html "New Haven offers an art-filled retreat close to home"]. ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', April 03, 2015 6:45 am  •  By Amy Bertrand&lt;/ref&gt; The original name was Urban Technical Centers, Inc., and subsequent changes included Vatterott &amp; Sullivan Educational Center and Vatterott Educational Centers.

The institution changed its name to Vatterott College in 1989 when associate degree (specialized) granting authority was issued by the Accrediting Commission of National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS), which is now called the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] (ACCSC).

In January 1985, the institution opened a facility in St. Ann, Missouri.

The college expanded to Springfield, Joplin, and Independence, Missouri, in April 1991 as a result of a teach-out of students attending Draughon Business College. In August 1991, Vatterott College was authorized to establish branch campuses at these locations. In May 1995, Vatterott College expanded to Quincy, Illinois, as a result of the acquisition of the former Quincy Technical Schools.

In June 1996, the Business and Banking Institutes with locations in Omaha, Nebraska, and Des Moines, Iowa, were acquired. Programs were added and the institutions were relocated under the Vatterott brand. In the same year, an additional location of the St. Ann campus opened in Sunset Hills, Missouri. Vatterott College expanded into the following cities as a result of various teach-out agreements: St. Joseph, Missouri, in March 1995; Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1997; Memphis, Tennessee, in 1999; Wichita, Kansas, in 1999; and Cleveland, Ohio in 2001. In 1997, a location was opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In December 1999, Vatterott College expanded in Omaha, Nebraska by acquiring the former Universal Technology Institute. In January 2000, a campus was established in O’Fallon, Missouri. In September 2001, Vatterott College purchased the former Omaha College of Health Careers in Omaha, Nebraska, and established a campus. [[Wellspring Capital Management]] acquired all Vatterott College locations in January 2003 and named the holding company as Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc.

L’Ecole Culinaire, a culinary school located in St. Louis, was opened in 2004. Vatterott College operations expanded into Texas in 2004, acquiring Court Reporting Institute of Dallas and the Court Reporting Institute of Houston. These two campuses are now closed (2015).

In January 2007, Vatterott Education Center located in Dallas, Texas was approved as a branch campus of the Quincy main institution and has since been closed (2014). The Vatterott Career College, Appling Farms (Memphis, TN) location was opened in April 2008. In November 2008, L’École Culinaire, Cordova, Tennessee, was opened. Vatterott College was established in Fairview Heights, Illinois in August, 2009 with seven diploma programs.

In September 2009, [[TA Associates]] acquired Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc. from WellSpring Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;''Vatterott Sold to TA Associates'', St. Louis Business Journal, Sept. 21, 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/09/21/daily29.html&lt;/ref&gt; That year three executives of the College were convicted of conspiring to obtain federal student grants and loans for students who were not eligible by providing false information and documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/for-profit-college-owner_b_8337428.html "For-Profit College Owner, Who Used Strippers As Lure, Goes On Trial"]. ''Huffington Post'', October 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The O’Fallon, Missouri, location relocated in the fall of 2010 to a  renovated building in St. Charles, MO. The Court Reporting Institute opened a campus in Arlington, Virginia, in December 2011 and was closed within one year after opening.

"ex’Treme Institute by Nelly", a music recording and production school, was opened in St. Louis Missouri in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;''Nelly's Ex'Treme Institute now open to students,'' KSDK-TV. http://www.ksdk.com/news/article/288651/3/Nellys-music-school-now-open-to-students&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nelly to Open Production School in St. Louis,'' BET.com, Nov. 27, 2011. http://www.bet.com/news/music/2011/11/27/nelly-to-open-production-school-in-st-louis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Bell is the former CEO of Vatterott Educational Centers, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;''Vatterott College Names Bell CEO'', St. Louis Business Journal, June 25, 2007. http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2007/06/25/daily4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the college was sued by a student who claimed that she was misled that her credits from the college would be transferable toward a nursing certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article1303067.html "Appeals court upholds student's case against Vatterott College"].

''KCTV News5'',  Jun 19, 2013 Chris Oberholtz, Amy Anderson and DeAnn Smith&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Brian Carroll, president of the college's Kansas City campus for the previous five years, was fired by the school because he allowed a homeless student to sleep in the library on a night where temperatures fell to -4 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/01/17/trade-school-fires-president-after-he-gave-homeless-student-shelter-in-library-during-sub-zero-weather/ "Trade school fires president after he let homeless student stay in library during sub-zero weather"], ''Fox 5 San Diego'', January 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
Vatterott College, Vatterott Career College, Vatterott Education Center and L’École Culinaire are accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] (ACCSC). The Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges is listed by the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] as a nationally recognized accrediting agency.

'''Verse drama''' is any [[drama]] written as [[poetry|verse]] to be spoken; another possible general term is '''poetic drama'''.  For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in [[Europe]] (and was also important in non-European cultures).  [[Greek tragedy]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s plays are written in verse, as is almost all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s drama, [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and others like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]''.

Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of [[tragedy]], providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of [[Christopher Fry]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] being possibly the end of a long tradition).

==Dramatic verse==
'''Dramatic verse''' occurs in a dramatic work, such as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], composed in poetic form.  The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as [[ancient Greece]].

The [[English Renaissance]] saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]] developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form.  Though a few plays, such as ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as [[blank verse]]; there are also passages of prose.

Dramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Verse drama did have a role in the development of [[Irish theatre]].

==Closet drama==
{{main|closet drama}}
An important trend from around 1800 was the [[closet drama]]: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.

Instead, [[opera]] would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse [[libretto]] can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. 

According to [[Robertson Davies]] in ''[[A Voice From the Attic]]'', closet drama is "''Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!''". But indeed a great deal of it was written in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded [[Epic poetry|epic]]. Prolific in the form were, for example, [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]] and [[Gordon Bottomley]].

==Dramatic poetry in general==
'''Dramatic poetry''' is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. 

The major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and [[libretti]]. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include [[dramatic monologue]]s, such as those written by [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

A '''volvelle''' or '''wheel chart''' is a type of [[slide chart]], a [[paper]] construction with rotating parts. It is considered an early example of a paper [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nick Kanas|title=VOLVELLES!

Early examples of volvelles are found in the pages of [[astronomy]] books. They can be traced back to "certain [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic treatises on humoral medicine]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Origin of Polyalphabetic Substitution|author=David Kahn|author-link=David Kahn (writer)|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=71|issue=1|date=March 1980|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=122–127 [126]|jstor=230316|doi=10.1086/352410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Persian astronomer]], [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (c. 1000), who made important contributions to the development of the volvelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=State, Science and Economy in Traditional Societies: Some Problems in Weberian Sociology of Science|author=Bryan S. Turner|journal=British Journal of Sociology|volume=38|issue=1|date=March 1987|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell (publisher)|Blackwell Publishing]]|pages=1–23 [12]|jstor=590576|doi=10.2307/590576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, the volvelle had many diverse uses. In ''Reinventing the Wheel'', author [[Jessica Helfand]] introduces twentieth-century volvelles with this:

{{quote|The twentieth century saw a robust growth in the design, manufacture, and production of a new generation of independent, free-standing volvelles. Categorically, they not only represent an unusually eclectic set of uses, but demonstrate, too, a remarkable range of stylistic, compositional, mechanical, informational, and kinetic conceits. There are volvelles that arrange their data peripherally, centrifugally, and radially; volvelles that use multiple concentric circles with pointers; and volvelles that benefit from the generous use of the die-cut, a particular technological hallmark of modern printing manufacture. Twentieth-century volvelles—often referred to as ''wheel charts''—offer everything from inventory control to color calibration, mileage metering to verb conjugation. They anticipate animal breeding cycles and calculate radiation exposure, measure chocolate consumption and quantify bridge tips, chart bird calls, convert metrics, and calculate taxes. There are fortune-telling wheels and semaphore-charting wheels; emergency first-aid wheels and electronic fix-it wheels; playful wheels that test phonetics and prophylactic wheels that prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing the Wheel|author=[[Jessica Helfand]]|publisher=[[Princeton Architectural Press]]|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56898-596-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lA26DBJI2YkC&amp;dq=helfand+%22reinventing+the+wheel%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] employed a volvelle in the sleeve design for the album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970).

Two games from the game company [[Infocom]] included volvelles inside their package as "[[feelie]]s": ''[[Sorcerer (video game)|Sorcerer]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Mind Forever Voyaging]]'' (1985). Both volvelles served to impede copying of the games, because they contained information needed to play the game.

An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related by law to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] and philosopher [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to Benjamin's cousin, [[Günther Anders]].

Among Benjamin's best known works are the essays "The Task of the Translator" (1923), "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), and "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Robert Walser (writer)|Walser]], and [[translation theory]]. He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide at [[Portbou]] on the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading [[Nazism|Nazi forces]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.

== Life ==
{{Frankfurt School}}

=== Early life and education ===
Benjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Berlin of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). The patriarch of Walter Benjamin's family, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader in Berlin; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. Benjamin's uncle [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] (born Wilhelm Louis Stern; 1871-1938) was a prominent German [[child psychology|child psychologist]] who developed the concept of the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), and Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]] (born Günther Siegmund Stern; 1902-1992) was a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Through his mother, his great-uncle was the classical archaeologist [[Gustav Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eiland, ''Walter Benjamin: A Critical Life'', Harvard University Press (2014), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled to the Kaiser Friedrich School in [[Charlottenburg]]; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. Walter Benjamin was a boy of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a [[boarding school]] in the [[Thuringia]]n countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.&lt;ref name="Witte" /&gt;

In 1912, at the age of twenty, he enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], but, at summer semester's end, returned to Berlin, then matriculated into the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], to continue studying philosophy. Here Benjamin had his first exposure to the ideas of [[Zionism]], which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This exposure gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of "cultural Zionism"—an attitude which recognized and promoted Judaism and Jewish values. In Benjamin's formulation his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. Benjamin expressed "My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual." This was a position that Benjamin largely held lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;Witte, Bernd. (1996) ''Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography''. New York: Verso. pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected president of the ''Freie Studentenschaft'' (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;'' Experience'', 1913&lt;/ref&gt; When not re-elected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg University to study, with particular attention to the lectures of [[Heinrich Rickert]]; at that time he travelled to France and Italy.

In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War (1914–1918), Benjamin began faithfully translating the works of the 19th-century French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867). The next year, 1915, he moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the [[University of Munich]], where he met [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]; the latter became a friend. In that year, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century [[Romanticism|Romantic]] German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] (1770–1843).

In 1917 he transferred to the [[University of Bern]]; there, he met [[Ernst Bloch]], and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner) (1890–1964) whom he later married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael (1918–1972). In 1919 Benjamin earned his [[Ph.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' with the dissertation ''Begriff der Kunstkritik in der Deutschen Romantik'' (''The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism''). Later, unable to support himself and family, he returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he published the essay ''Kritik der Gewalt'' (The Critique of Violence). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with [[Leo Strauss]], and Benjamin would remain an admirer of Strauss and of his work throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. 1981. Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship. Trans. Harry Zohn, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, 1932–40'', New York 1989, page 155-58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
In 1923, when the ''[[Institute for Social Research|Institut für Sozialforschung]]'' (Institute for Social Research) was founded, later to become home to the [[Frankfurt School]], Benjamin published ''Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens''. At that time he became acquainted with [[Theodor Adorno]] and befriended [[Georg Lukács]], whose ''The Theory of the Novel'' (1920) much influenced him. Meanwhile, the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] consequent to the First World War made it difficult for the father Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son's family. At the end of 1923 his best friend Gershom Scholem immigrated to Palestine, a country under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the Continent for the Middle East.

In 1924 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], in the ''Neue Deutsche Beiträge'' magazine, published ''Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften'' (''[[Elective Affinities]]''), by Walter Benjamin, about Goethe's third novel, ''[[Elective Affinities|Die Wahlverwandtschaften]]'' (1809). Later that year Benjamin and Ernst Bloch resided on the Italian island of [[Capri]]; Benjamin wrote ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''), as a [[habilitation]] dissertation meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany. He also read, at Bloch's suggestion, ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) by Georg Lukács. He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress [[Asja Lācis]], then residing in Moscow; she became his lover and was a lasting intellectual influence upon him.

A year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection;&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;Jane O. Newman, ''Benjamin's Library: Modernity, Nation, and the Baroque'', Cornell University Press, 2011, p. 28: "...university officials in Frankfurt recommended that Benjamin withdraw the work from consideration as his Habilitation."&lt;/ref&gt; he was not to be an academic instructor. Working with [[Franz Hessel]] (1880–1941) he translated the first volumes of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' (In Search of Lost Time) by [[Marcel Proust]]. The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' (The Frankfurt Times) and ''Die Literarische Welt'' (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926 (the year his father, Emil Benjamin, died) Walter Benjamin went to Moscow to meet Asja Lācis and found her ill in a sanatorium.&lt;ref&gt;''Moscow Diary''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, he began ''[[The Arcades Project|Das Passagen-Werk]]'' (The Arcades Project), his uncompleted ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Gershom Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Continental Europe (Germany) to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published ''Einbahnstraße'' (One-Way Street), and a revision of his habilitation dissertation ''Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''). In 1929 Berlin, Asja Lācis, then assistant to [[Bertolt Brecht]], socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, he also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

=== Exile and death ===
[[File:BenjaminBnF.jpg|alt= Walter Benjamin's membership card for the Bibliothèque nationale de France (1940).|thumb|257x257px|Walter Benjamin's membership card for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (1940).]]
In 1932, during the turmoil preceding [[Adolf Hitler]]'s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Walter Benjamin left Germany for the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]] for some months; he then moved to [[Nice]], where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the socio-political and cultural significance of the [[Reichstag fire]] (27 February 1933) as the ''de facto'' Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|persecution of the Jews]], he moved to Paris, but, before doing so, he sought shelter in [[Svendborg]], at Bertolt Brecht's house, and at [[Sanremo]], where his ex-wife Dora lived.

As he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with [[Max Horkheimer]], and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other German artists and intellectuals, refugees there from Germany; he befriended [[Hannah Arendt]], novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. In 1936, a first version of ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' (''L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction méchanisée'') was published, in French, by Max Horkheimer in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' journal of the [[Institute for Social Research]]. It was a critique of the authenticity of mass-produced art; he wrote that a mechanically produced copy of an artwork can be taken somewhere where the original could never have gone, arguing that the presence of the original is "prerequisite to the concept of authenticity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin|first=Walter|date=1968|chapter=The Work Of Art In The Age Of Mechanical Reproduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=217–253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Benjamin's apartment in Paris (fot. Mateusz Palka).jpg|thumb|342x342px|Walter Benjamin's Paris apartment at 10 [[:fr:Rue Dombasle|rue Dombasle]] (1938–1940)]]In 1937 Benjamin worked on ''Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire'' (The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire), met [[Georges Bataille]] (to whom he later entrusted the ''Arcades Project'' manuscript), and joined the [[College of Sociology]]. In 1938 he paid a last visit to Bertolt Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Régime]] stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near [[Nevers]], in central [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].

Returning to Paris in January 1940, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Geschichte'' (''On the Concept of History'', later published as ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]''). While the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushing back the [[French Army]], on 13 June Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of [[Lourdes]], just a day before the Germans entered the capital with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the US that Max Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the [[Gestapo]], Benjamin planned to travel to the US from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via [[Francoist Spain]], then ostensibly a neutral country.

[[File:Grab Walter Benjamin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walter Benjamin's grave in Portbou. The epitaph in German, repeated in Catalan, quotes from Section 7 of ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism"]]The historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of [[Portbou]], in [[Catalonia]]. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. They tried to cross the border on 25 September 1940, but were told by the Spanish police that they would be deported back to France the next day, which would have destroyed Benjamin's plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Walter Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets that night, while staying in the ''Hotel de Francia''; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the official date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arendt|editor=Walter Benjamin|first=Hannah|date=1968|chapter=Introduction|url=|title=Illuminations: Essays and Reflections|pages=23–24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Esther|title=Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXUN34lH-jgC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=August 28, 2009|series=Modern European Thinkers|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1568-3|page=215|chapter=Benjamin's Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=August 28, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=74|chapter=Suicide to Escape Capture: Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin's colleague [[Arthur Koestler]], also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but he survived.&lt;ref&gt;"Afraid of being caught by the Gestapo while fleeing France, [Koestler] borrowed suicide pills from Walter Benjamin. He took them several weeks later when it seemed he would be unable to get out of Lisbon, but didn't die." [[Anne Applebaum]], "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/26/did-the-death-of-communis_n_435939.html Did The Death Of Communism Take Koestler And Other Literary Figures With It?]" Huffington Post, 28 March 2010, URL retrieved 15 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin's brother Georg was killed at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in 1942. Despite his suicide, Benjamin was buried in the [[consecration|consecrated]] section of a Roman Catholic cemetery.

The others in his party were allowed passage the next day (maybe because Benjamin's suicide shocked Spanish officials), and safely reached [[Lisbon]] on 30 September. [[Hannah Arendt]], who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of ''Theses'' to [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered. Some critics speculate that it was his ''Arcades Project'' in a final form; this is very unlikely as the author's plans for the work had changed in the wake of Adorno's criticisms in 1938, and it seems clear that the work was flowing over its containing limits in his last years.

== Thought ==
[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|thumb|right|293x293px|[[Paul Klee]]'s 1920 painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'', which Benjamin compared to "the angel of history"]]
Walter Benjamin corresponded much with [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and was occasionally funded by the [[Frankfurt School]] under the direction of Adorno and [[Horkheimer]], even from their New York City residence. The competing influences—Brecht's Marxism, Adorno's [[critical theory]], Gerschom Scholem's Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic [[Paul de Man]] argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin's writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is ''Theses on the Philosophy of History''. At least one scholar, [[religious studies|historian of religion]] Jason Josephson-Storm, has argued that Benjamin's diverse interests may be understood in part by understanding the influence of [[Western Esotericism]] on Benjamin. Some of Benjamin's key ideas were adapted from occultists and [[New Age movement|New Age]] figures including [[Eric Gutkind]] and [[Ludwig Klages]], and his interest in esotericism is known to have extended far beyond the Jewish [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 226–36 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' ===
{{main|Theses on the Philosophy of History}}
''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' is often cited as Benjamin's last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published ''Theses'' in Benjamin's memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the ''Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin'':

{{quote|In the "Concept of History" Benjamin also turned to Jewish mysticism for a model of praxis in dark times, inspired by the kabbalistic precept that the work of the holy man is an activity known as tikkun. According to the kabbalah, God's attributes were once held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by the presence of evil and these vessels had consequently shattered, disseminating their contents to the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the process of collecting the scattered fragments in the hopes of once more piecing them together. Benjamin fused tikkun with the Surrealist notion that liberation would come through releasing repressed collective material, to produce his celebrated account of the revolutionary historiographer, who sought to grab hold of elided memories as they sparked to view at moments of present danger.}}

In the essay, Benjamin's famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the [[Idea of Progress]] in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:

{{quote|A Klee painting named ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.}}

The final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the [[Messiah]] provides a harrowing final point to Benjamin's work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, to try to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future "for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter."

=== ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' ===
{{main|The Origin of German Tragic Drama}}

''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the [[Counter-Reformation]] (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the (post-doctoral) dissertation meant to earn him the ''[[Habilitation]]'' (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.

Professor Schultz of University of Frankfurt found ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' inappropriate for his ''Germanistik'' department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics (philosophy of art), the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin's work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' as a ''Habilitation'' dissertation to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt; He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as a book.&lt;ref&gt;''Introducing Walter Benjamin'', Howard Cargill, Alex Coles, Andrey Klimowski, 1998, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Arcades Project ===
{{Main|Arcades Project}}The ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'' (Arcades Project, 1927–40) was Walter Benjamin's final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the ''[[Passages couverts de Paris]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the covered passages that extended the culture of [[flâneur|''flânerie'']] (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made ''flânerie'' infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper.

The Arcades Project, in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes which Benjamin filed together over the course of thirteen years, from 1927 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Buck-Morss, Susan. ''The Dialectics of Seeing''. The MIT Press, 1991, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arcades Project was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.

=== Writing style ===
[[Susan Sontag]] said that in Walter Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence "had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes", a "freeze-frame baroque" style of writing and cogitation. "His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sontag ''Under the Sign of Saturn,'' p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of Benjamin's writing style is essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use [[Intertextuality|intertexts]] to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.

Walter Benjamin's writings identify him as a [[Modernism|modernist]] for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his [[Style (visual arts)|stylistic]] concerns in "The Task of the Translator", wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.

His work ''The Task of the Translator'' was later commented by the French translation scholar [[Antoine Berman]] (''[[L'âge de la traduction]]'').

== Legacy and reception ==
Since the publication of ''Schriften'' (Writings, 1955), 15 years after his death, Benjamin's work—especially the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines. In 1968, the first [[Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft]] was established by the [[Germany|German]] thinker, poet and artist [[Natias Neutert]], as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin's body of thought as a scholastic "closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open", as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Mit Walter Benjamin. Gründungsmanifest der Internationalen Walter-Benjamin-Gesellschaft.'' Copyleft Verlag, Hamburg, 1968, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The members felt liberated to take Benjamin's ideas as a welcome touchstone for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Hereto Helmut Salzinger: ''Swinging Benjamin. Verlag Michael Kellner, Hamburg 1990. {{ISBN|3-927623-05-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft, a new one, established in 2000, researches and discusses the imperative that Benjamin formulated in his ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': "In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it."

The successor society was registered in Karlsruhe (Germany); Chairman of the Board of Directors was Bernd Witte, an internationally recognized Benjamin scholar and Professor of Modern German Literature in Düsseldorf (Germany). Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and represents an international forum for discourse. The Society supported research endeavors devoted to the creative and visionary potential of Benjamin's works and their view of 20th century modernism. Special emphasis had been placed upon strengthening academic ties to Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walterbenjamin.info/|title=International Walter Benjamin Society|website=walterbenjamin.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The society conducts conferences and exhibitions, as well as interdisciplinary and intermedial events, at regular intervals and different European venues:
* Barcelona Conference – September 2000
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Berlin – November 2001
* Walter-Benjamin-Evening at Karlsruhe – January 2003
* Rome Conference – November 2003

* Vienna Conference – March 2007&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://walterbenjamin.info/ WalterBenjamin.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Walter Benjamin's ''Arcades Project'' was reinterpreted in an exhibition curated by [[Jens Hoffmann|Jens Hoffman]], held at the [[Jewish museum|Jewish Museum]] in New York City. The exhibition, entitled "The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin", features 36 contemporary artworks representing the 36 convolutes of Benjamin's Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/the-arcades-contemporary-art-and-walter-benjamin|title=The Arcades: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin (March 17 - August 6, 2017)|website=''The Jewish Museum''. thejewishmuseum.org|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Democracy}}
In [[political science]], a '''wave of democracy''' refers to a major surge of [[democracy]] in history. The term "Third Wave of Democracy" was first coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]] in his article published in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and further expounded in his 1991 book ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]''. 

Huntington describes global democratization as coming in three waves, the first beginning in the early 19th century and the third being a current event.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;{{cite news

|title=What Is Democracy? - Democracy's Third Wave 
|publisher=U.S. State Department
|accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto, have referred to 13 waves from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011-2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunitsky|first=Seva|date=2018|title=Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/democratic-waves-in-historical-perspective/9452AFC439DD960F4D219246A7E7F51E|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=634–651|doi=10.1017/S1537592718001044|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huntingon's three waves==
===First wave=== 
The First wave of democracy began in the early 19th century when [[suffrage]] was granted to the majority of white males in the [[United States]] ("[[Jacksonian democracy]]"). At its peak, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world. This continued until 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power in [[Italy]]. The ebb of the first wave lasted from 1922 until 1942, during which the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere 12.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

===Second wave===

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in [[World War II]], and crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the "flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to surge in a way no one had ever seen.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some countries change their positions quite dramatically: [[Switzerland]], which is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the right to vote until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela. (2000). “Women's Suffrage in the Measurement of Democracy: Problems of Operationalization.” ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 35(3): 92-111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave===

The Third wave began in 1974 ([[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal) and included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and regions ([[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]) from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schenoni, Luis and Scott Mainwaring|title=Hegemonic Effects and Regime Change in Latin America|journal=Democratization|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754?journalCode=fdem20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures there are well over 100 democracies in the world today{{when|date=November 2016}}, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  Many of these newer democracies are not fully "consolidated," however, meaning that while they have electoral institutions in place, political democracy remains fragile.  Reasons for this fragility include economic instability, continued elite dominance of politics, ongoing military interference in civilian affairs, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Larry. (1996). “Is the Third Wave Over?” ''Journal of Democracy'' 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy during a wave are subject to [[democratic backsliding]]. Political scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and second waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Paul W.|title=Democratic Breakdown in Paraguay and Venezuela: The Shape of Things to Come for Latin America?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–116|doi=10.1177/0095327X0303000104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/30/1/87.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the period immediately following the onset of the "war on terror" after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident.  How significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of debate.

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslided from democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma and Morocco. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Arab Spring==
Experts have associated the collapse of several dictatorships in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], phenomenon known as Arab Spring, with the events which followed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The similarity between the two phenomena inspired hope for a fourth wave of [[democratization]]. However, a few months after the apparent beginning of the transition, most of the Arab political openings closed, causing an inevitable pull-back. One of the most alarming cases was that of Egypt, where the government, controlled by the military, did not facilitate the democratic transition in any way. On the contrary, it strove to silence the protests by arresting peaceful protesters and by “trying them in military tribunals.”{{fact|date=March 2018}} A concrete example is provided by the story of [[Maikel Nabil Sanad|Maikel Nabil]], an Egyptian blogger convicted to be imprisoned for three years for “insulting the [[military]] establishment.” The main causes of the regression and crisis in all the affected countries are attributed to corruption, unemployment, social injustice, and autocratic political systems.

Despite the apparently unsolvable situation, the [[United Nations|UN]], under the administration of [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]], tried to work as a mediator between the governments and the protesters. Moreover, according to [[Larry Diamond]], the engagement of the [[United States|United States of America]] in the democratic transition of the Arab world was fundamental. He attributed to the country the role of mentor and example for the newborn democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-05-22/fourth-wave-or-false-start|title = A Fourth Wave or False Start?|website = Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital media]] played a much longer term role in creating favorable conditions for uprisings, helped to publicize key igniting events, and then facilitated those uprisings and their diffusion; but digital media did not do this alone or as suddenly as some observers have claimed. The story of the Arab Spring, according to Howard and Hussain, began over a decade ago as Internet access and mobile phones began to diffuse rapidly through North Africa and the Middle East. The citizens that could afford internet access, the wealthy and powerful mostly, played a huge role in the [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Bahrain]] [[Rebellion|uprisings]]. Over time, online criticisms of regimes became more public and common, setting the stage for the [[Arab Spring]]. Digital media also allowed women and other minorities to enter these political discussions, and, ultimately, the ensuing protests and revolutions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Howard|first = Phillip N. |date= 2013 |title= Democracy’s Fourth Wave? Digital Media and the Arab Spring |url= http://philhoward.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Democracys-Fourth-Wave-First-3-Chapters.pdf |id= OUP |doi= |access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other waves ==
In a 2018 study in ''Perspectives on Politics,'' Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto refers to thirteen waves of democracy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:

# The Atlantic Wave (1776-1798)
# The Latin American Wars of Independence (1809-1824)
# The First Constitutional Wave (1820-1821)
# The Romantic-Nationalist Wave (1830-1831)
# The Spring of Nations (1848)
# The Second Constitutional Wave (1905-1912)
# The post-WWI Wave (1919-1922)
# The post-WWII Wave (1945-1950)
# The African Decolonization Wave (1956-1968)
# The Modernization Wave, also known as the "Third" Wave (1974-1988)
# The Post-Soviet Wave (1989-1994)
# The Color Revolutions (2000-2007)
# The Arab Spring (2011-2012)
