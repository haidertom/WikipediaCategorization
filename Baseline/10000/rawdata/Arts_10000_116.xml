The '''Altarpiece of the Halberd''' is a painting from around 1539  by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]]. It is housed in the [[Pinacoteca civica Francesco Podesti]] of [[Ancona]], central Italy.

==History==

The work was seen by the art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the church of [[Sant'Agostino, Ancona|Sant'Agostino]] in Ancona, where Lotto had fled in reply to the hostility received in Venice. It was later moved to the church of [[Santa Maria della Piazza]] and, after other locations, the current one. 

The painting dates to a few years after the [[coup]] by which Ancona had been restored to the [[Papal States]]. The resistance had been brutally suppressed, many of the rebels having been beheaded by order of the papal legate. The upside-down [[halberd]] has been thus interpreted as a symbol of peace.

==Description==
The monumental composition is taken directly from the tradition of [[Holy Conversation]]s in the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]], inaugurated by [[Antonello da Messina]]'s [[San Cassiano Altarpiece]]. It shows the Madonna and Child on a high throne, with two angels holding the crown (a 15th-century [[Flemish painting]] element also in use in Italy). In the lower part are four saints: Stephen, John the Evangelist, [[Simon the Zealot]] and [[St. Lawrence|Lawrence]]. Simon is holding the [[halberd]] which gives its name to the altarpiece. At the sides of the throne, between columns and draperies, are two sections of sky with clouds. 

Like in other Lotto's works, the symmetry is broken by the variety of postures and gestures; the work is general characterized by a certain archaic style, explainable by the relatively provincial commissioners and the late stage of his career.

[[Image:Star Wars in Tunisia.jpg|thumb|200px|''Star Wars'' filming location in Tunisia]]
'''Architecture in ''Star Wars''''' includes the cities, buildings, ships, and other structures of the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] as described and depicted in books, movies, comics, and cartoons. ''[[Architects Journal]]'' ranked the top 10, including the [[Death Star]] and the [[Jedi Temple]].&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;James Pallister [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5203477 Top 10: The Architecture of Star Wars (pt II)]
15 June 2009 Architects Journal (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the urban and natural environments pictured in ''Star Wars'', Mark Lamster wrote that the cities are places of danger and corruption, while the forces of good find sanctuary in the natural world.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"&gt;Mark Lamster "Evil foes build ever-more-elaborate urban monstrosities- machines not for living but killing, and killing on a grand scale" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234 Architecture and film] Star Wars and the City page 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes the "retro-[[futurist]]" cities in the series as being in between those extremes and places  of "great beauty but dubious moral character." He attributes the ambivalence towards urbanity to series creator [[George Lucas]]' own feelings about cities and urban environments.&lt;ref name="ambivalent"/&gt;
 
The settings of the movie have generally been praised, but one author took exception to the "anachronistic period architecture and statuary" of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', saying it improperly associated [[third world]] buildings with conceptions of innocence and the primitive in a way that was discriminatory and demeaning.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Planet settings==
[[Luke Skywalker]] is first seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' living with his adoptive parents in a "complex of caves and domed structures" on [[Tatooine]], filmed in the [[Tunisia]]n desert town of [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]].&lt;ref name="hives"&gt;Mark Lamster [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxis1i4jxVwC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=star+wars+architecture#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20architecture&amp;f=false Architecture and film] Wretched Hives: George Lucas and the Ambivalent Architecture of Star Wars page 234&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the first movie was shot in the [[Guatemala]]n [[rain forest]] where a celebration with rebel allies takes place in a caved area (a scene said to be borrowed from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1935 [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;). The exotic locales provide scenery that is unfamiliar to "all but a few experts in non-western architecture", providing the films with fantastic settings that could still be believable.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

==Urban planning==
Three architecture and planning students noted that the "latest" (1999) ''Star Wars'' movie ''(The Phantom Menace)'' offered "a variety of urban development options" in a ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' story headlined "How would you like to live on a Star Wars' world?"&lt;ref name="cosmic"&gt;Roger M. Showley "The latest "Star Wars" movie offers a variety of urban development options according to three architecture and planning students who previewed the film; from left, [Tim Belzman], San Diego State University; Bruce Fallown, Newschool of Architecture; and [David Sin], Woodbury University School of Architecture." [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/74622433.html?dids=74622433:74622433&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+30%2C+1999&amp;author=Roger+M.+Showley&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Cosmic+communities+%7C+How+would+you+like+to+live+on+a+%60Star+Wars'+world%3F&amp;pqatl=google Cosmic communities]; How would you like to live on a `Star Wars' world? May 30, 1999 page H.1 San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The article included illustrations of [[Coruscant]] ("completely covered by development" and "surrounded by mile-high skyscrapers"), including views from the [[Jedi]] Council building, and the city of ''Theed'' (inspired by [[Palace of Caserta|an 18th-century palace]] near [[Naples|Naples, Italy]]).&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; On Coruscant, "development extends miles below the surface of the city and up into the clouds."&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt;

The "urban future" has also been depicted in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' where "the setting is a grimy, crime-ridden [[Los Angeles]] in the 21st century".&lt;ref name="cosmic"/&gt; The architecture of ''Star Wars'' may also have been influenced by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt; The designs continued Lucas' work from his first feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]'', which featured a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], [[George Orwell|Orwellian]] "subteranean world of black-and-white spaces" where the population is subdued with drugs and kept under constant surveillance.&lt;ref name="hives"/&gt;

===Jedi Temple===
''[[Architects' Journal]]'' rated the '''Jedi Temple''' (located in the capital planet of ''[[Coruscant]]'') third on its top-ten architecture of ''Star Wars'' list behind the second [[Death Star]] and [[Jabba the Hutt’s palace]] on [[Tatooine]], and ahead of Coruscant, capital city of the Old Republic.&lt;ref name="architecture" /&gt; The temple is described in the article as adapting "the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength" and said to be a [[ziggurat]] that "is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive."&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquillity Spire, that are stylistically similar to the [[minaret]]s surrounding the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about ''Star Wars'' in its one hundredth issue special.

==Ships==

== Galleries ==

=== Art Dubai Contemporary ===

Art Dubai’s gallery halls are split into four main sections: Contemporary, Modern, Bawwaba and Residents. Art Dubai Contemporary features commercial galleries operating on the primary market that have been established for at least two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutdubai.com/art/events/40410-art-dubai-2016|title=Art Dubai 2016|website=Time Out Dubai|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 60 galleries are selected every year for Art Dubai Contemporary, from established galleries to younger art spaces from under-represented art capitals. Likewise, exhibited artists range from emerging practitioners to industry heavyweights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/art/103384/art-dubai-highlights.html|title=Art Dubai: calm and collected-Telegraph|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works presented at the fair cover painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, video, photography and performance. At the 2019 edition of Art Dubai, more than 90 galleries from over 40 countries will be featured, including newcomers from Cameroon and Colombia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cdn.artdubai.ae/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AD19_PR_Art-Dubai-Announces-Gallery-Line-Up-For-Its-2019-Edition_EN.pdf|title=Art Dubai website|last=|first=|date=2018-11-07|work=Art Dubai|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Art Dubai Modern ===

Art Dubai Modern, established in 2014, is devoted to Modern art from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Each exhibitor presents a solo, two-person or multi-artist show, featuring works by Modern masters of the 20th century, with a focus on work produced between the 1940s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/culture/arts/art-dubai-continues-its-cultural-journey-1.1687184|title=Art Dubai continues its cultural journey|last=Review|first=By Jyoti Kalsi, Special to Weekend|date=2016-03-09|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, Art Dubai Modern will move into one of the two main Contemporary halls, to allow for a better reading of the region's art history and contextualization of the Contemporary works on show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.artdubai.ae/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AD19_PR_Art-Dubai-Announces-Gallery-Line-Up-For-Its-2019-Edition_EN.pdf|title=ART DUBAI ANNOUNCES GALLERY LINE-UP AND NEW STRUCTURE FOR ITS 2019 EDITION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Dubai Modern’s Advisory Committee is composed of Dr Nada Shabout, professor of Art History and the Coordinator of the Contemporary Arab and Muslim Cultural Studies Initiative (CAMCSI) at the University of North Texas; Dr Iftikhar Dadi, associate professor in Cornell University’s Department of History of Art and Chair of its Department of Art; Catherine David, Deputy Director of Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris; and Vali Mahlouji, curator, director of the Kaveh Golestan Estate, independent advisor to the [[British Museum]] and founder of the curatorial think tank Archaeology of the Final Decade.

=== Residents ===

Art Dubai presented its first edition of Residents, a 4-week residency programme hosted by the fair, in March 2018. Through this programme-cum-gallery section, multidisciplinary gallery artists from all over the world are invited to the UAE to create new works, in fully equipped Dubai and Abu Dhabi studio spaces, inspired by their experiences in the UAE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artdubai.ae/residents-2-2/|title=Art Dubai Residents - Art Dubai|last=Dubai|first=Art|work=Art Dubai|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The artists’ selection of works are displayed in a special exhibition area at the fair. The 2019 edition of Residents will focus exclusively on Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdubai.ae/residents-2/2019/|title=Residents - Art Dubai|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bawwaba ===

Art Dubai 2019 will see the launch of Bawwaba, a unique gallery section, located within the main gallery halls. The section will feature projects by individual artists or galleries, located in or focused on the Middle East, Africa, Central and South Asia as well as Latin America.

The inaugural edition of Bawwaba will be curated by French-Cameroonian curator Élise Atangana, and focus on highly conceptual works including videos, installations and murals. The section aims to give visitors a curated reading of the Global South, acting, as its name suggests, as a gateway to current artistic developments from these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.artdubai.ae/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AD19_PR_Art-Dubai-Announces-Gallery-Line-Up-For-Its-2019-Edition_EN.pdf|title=Art Dubai|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Global Art Forum ==
The Global Art Forum is the largest annual arts conference in the Middle East and Asia and takes place every year at Art Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/map/vernacular-curatorial-practice-in-the-united-arab-emirates|title=Vernacular Curatorial Practice in the United Arab Emirates|date=2016-04-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference features live talks, panel discussions and performances by regional and international thought leaders, artists, curators and writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buro247.me/culture/arts/buro-24-7-middle-east-s-complete-guide-to-art-duba.html|title=Buro 24/7 Middle East's complete guide to Art Dubai|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers include high-profile figures such as [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], [[Michael Stipe]] and [[Christo]]. In 2018, the Global Art Forum was co-directed by Noah Raford and Marlies Wirth with Commissioner [[Shumon Basar]] and held under the title 'I Am Not a Robot', focusing on the timely theme of power, paranoia and potentials of automation.

== Education ==
Art Dubai’s non-for-profit educational programming, provides programmes for children through to post-graduates. Art Dubai’s education initiatives include Campus Art Dubai, a community art school for UAE-based artists, curators, writers, designers and enthusiasts, Forum Fellows, a fellowship that brings together young curators and writers from the Middle East; and The Sheikha Manal Little Artist Program for children aged 5 to 17. The fair also has an internship and volunteer programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaararabia.com/art/exhibitions/art-dubai-2016|title=Art Dubai 2016: All Roads Connect|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Dubai Portraits ==
In Spring 2017, the fair started producing Art Dubai Portraits, a series of 1- and 3-minute films focusing on artists that are connected to the fair through its programming and participating galleries. Unique in showing the artists’ personal- and work-spaces as well as capturing their personality, the Art Dubai Portraits serve as a one-of-a-kind resource for curators and researchers working on the art from the region.

== Economic Impact ==
In March 2016, the fairs’ parent company, Art Dubai Fair FZ LLC (The Art Dubai Group), released the results of an independent survey for Art Week 2015 (March 18–25, 2015). The results show that the total economic impact the Art Dubai and Design Days Dubai events have on the local economy and service sector totaled US $35 million across seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/gn-focus/special-reports/events/art-week-paints-dubai-green-with-dh128-million-economic-contribution-1.1682149|title=Art Week paints Dubai green with Dh128 million economic contribution|last=team|first=By the GN Focus|date=2016-03-01|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/art-dubai-said-contribute-35m-local-economy-623450.html#.V7BX2_l95hG|title=Art Dubai said to contribute $35m to local economy|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/dubai-fair-showcases-success-art-10th-190215675.html?ref=gs|title=Dubai fair showcases success in art in 10th year|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attitudes of Lady Hamilton by Novelli.jpg|thumb|right|Emma, [[Lady Hamilton]] made the striking of attitudes into an art form, portraying classical themes such as the [[Judgement of Paris]].]]
'''Attitude''' as a term of [[fine art]] refers to the [[human position|posture]] or [[gesture]] given to a [[Figurative art|figure]] by a [[painting|painter]] or [[sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;John Craig, ''A New Universal Etymological, Technological, and Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language Embracing All the Terms Used in Art, Science, and Literature'' (London, 1844), p. 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0Tup952oMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA130&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It applies to the [[human body|body]] and not to a [[mental state]]&lt;!--this link to a disambiguation page is deliberate--&gt;, but the arrangement of the body is presumed to serve a communicative or expressive purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Woldmar Ruoff, ''The Standard Dictionary of Facts'' (The Frontier press company, 1916), p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mm0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA222&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a [[Convention (norm)#Others|conventional]] attitude in art is [[proskynesis]] to indicate submissive respect toward [[Christian God|God]], [[emperor]]s, [[cleric]]s of high status, and religious [[icon]]s; in [[Byzantine art]], it is particularly characteristic in depictions of the emperor paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Ross, ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996), p. 205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=b-5YPoia7qwC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22PROSKYNESIS.+The+Greek+term%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th- and 21st-century [[art history]], "attitude" is used most often to label one of these conventional postures; another example is the [[orans]] pose.

"Attitude" was arguably more important as an [[aesthetic]] term in the 19th century, when it was defined in one art-related dictionary as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the posture or disposition of the limbs and members of a figure, by which we discover the action in which it is engaged, and the very sentiment supposed to be in the mind of the person represented. It comprehends all the motions of the body, and requires a perfect knowledge of [[wikt:ponderation|ponderation]], and whatever refers to the [[center of gravity|centre of gravity]]; but whatsoever attitude be given to any figure, that attitude must show the beautiful parts, as much as the subject will permit, let the subject be what it will. It must, besides, have such a turn as, without departing from probability, or from the character of the figure, may diffuse a [[beauty]] over the action. It is allowed that the choice of fine attitudes constitutes the greatest part of the beauties of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;John Gould, ''Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Artists: Comprising Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, and Architects, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time'' (London: E. Wilson, 1835), p. xc [https://books.google.com/books?id=O54ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP104&amp;dq=attitude+intitle:dictionary+intitle:art&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Chez le père Lathuille''''' (''At the Père Lathuille Restaurant'') is an 1879 oil on canvas painting by [[Édouard Manet]], now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts Tournai]]. He painted it just before his death and signed it "Manet, 1879". In the background is the proprietor - Manet also painted [[Portrait of Marguerite Gauthier-Lathuille |a portrait]] of his daughter.

Père Lathuille's cabaret and later restaurant was sited in the [[Batignolles]] quarter, on the site now occupied by a cinema at 7 Avenue de Clichy, just after the Barrière de Clichy so as to escape Parisian wine taxes. During the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|defence of Paris]] on 30 March 1814 marshal [[Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey]] had used it as his command post. Just before the enemy arrived, Père Lathuille had handed out free drinks to the soldiers, saying "Drink, my friends, drink for free - don't leave a single bottle of my wine in the casks".

{{Performing arts}}

A '''circus''' is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that may include [[clown]]s, [[acrobatics|acrobats]], trained animals, [[trapeze]] acts, [[musician]]s, [[dancers]], [[hoopers]], [[tightrope walker]]s, [[juggling|jugglers]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]]s, [[unicycle|unicyclists]], as well as other [[object manipulation]] and stunt-oriented artists. The term ''circus'' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. [[Philip Astley]] is credited with being the father of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. A skilled equestrian, Astley demonstrated trick riding, riding in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did, and thus chanced on the format which was later named a "circus".  In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The traditional format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.

As styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited covered seating. From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage. The traditional large tents, commonly known as "Big Tops" were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue and remain so to the present day. Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos. Many circus performances are still held in a ring usually 13&amp;nbsp;m (42&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.

[[Contemporary circus]] has been credited with reviving the circus tradition since the 1980s when a number of groups introduced circuses based almost solely on human skills and which drew from other performing art skills and styles.

==Etymology==
First attested in English 14th century, the word ''circus'' derives from [[Latin]] ''circus'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcircus circus], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κίρκος'' (''kirkos''), itself a [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] of the [[Homeric Greek]] ''κρίκος'' (''krikos''), meaning "circle" or "ring".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkri%2Fkos krikos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''De Spectaculis'' early Christian writer Tertullian claimed  that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honour of her father Helios, the Sun God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tertullian|first=Septimus Florens| title=De Spectaculis|year=1931|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Champion great danes from the Imperial kennels, poster for Forepaugh and Sells Brothers, 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Sells Brothers Circus]] with Great Danes ]]
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|Video of a circus from 1954.]]
The modern and commonly held idea of a circus is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein. However, the history of circuses is more complex, with historians disagreeing on its origin, as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research, and the ongoing circus phenomenon. For many, circus history begins with Englishman [[Philip Astley]], while for others its origins go back much further—to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times.

===Origins===

In Ancient Rome, the ''[[Circus (building)|circus]]'' was a building for the exhibition of horse and chariot races, equestrian shows, staged battles, gladiatorial combat and displays of (and fights with) trained animals. The circus of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek [[hippodrome]]s, although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction, and for events that involved re-enactments of naval battles, the circus was flooded with water. The Roman circus buildings were, however, not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends. The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank, There were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends. The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated.  Some circus historians such as [[George Speaight]] have stated "these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called 'circuses' by the Romans, but it is a mistake to equate these places, or the entertainments presented there, with the modern circus" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Speaight|first=George|title=A History of the Circus|year=1980|publisher=The Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=0498024709|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman circuses and a chronology of circus-related entertainment can be traced to Roman times, continued by the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] that operated until the 13th century, through medieval and renaissance jesters, minstrels and troubadours to the late 18th century and the time of Astley. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Croft-Cooke &amp; Cotes|first=Rupert &amp; Peter|title=Circus: A World History|year=1976|publisher=Paul Elek|location=London|isbn=0236400517|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dagron |first=Gilbert |title= L’ Hippodrome de Constantinople: Jeux, Peuple et Politique |year=2011 |publisher= Éditions Gallimard|location=Paris |isbn=978-2-07-013378-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first circus in the city of Rome was the [[Circus Maximus]], in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills.  It was constructed during the monarchy and, at first, built completely from wood. After being rebuilt several times, the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat 250,000 people; it was built of stone and measured 400m in length and 90m in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novaroma.org/ludi/html/history.html |title=History of the Ludi |publisher=Novaroma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next in importance were the [[Circus Flaminius]] and the [[Circus Neronis]], from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero. A [[Circus of Maxentius|fourth circus]] was constructed by [[Maxentius]]; its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus.

For some time after the fall of Rome, large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment. Instead, itinerant performers, animal trainers and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe, performing at local fairs. &lt;!--Another possible link between the Roman and modern circus could have been bands of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] who appeared in Europe in the 14th century and in Britain from the 15th century, bringing with them circus skills and trained animals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} ['''Factually incomplete.  It is not made clear what connection the Roma (Gypsy) people and Roman people have.  Is this a confusion between the words 'Roma' (Gypsy) and 'Roman'?

====Astley and early British circus====
[[Image:Astley's Amphitheatre Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|[[Astley's Amphitheatre]] in London c.1808]]
The origin of the modern circus has been attributed to [[Philip Astley]], who was born 1742 in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England. He became a cavalry officer who set up the first modern amphitheatre for the display of horse riding tricks in Lambeth, London on 4 April 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Kwint, ‘Astley, Philip (1742–1814)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/821, accessed 7 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Speaight|first=George|title=A History of the Circus|year=1980|publisher=Tantivy Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'' lists the 1791 book ''The History of the Royal Circus'' about Philip Astley's troupe as the first written use of the word to describe the modern circus.&lt;/ref&gt; Astley did not originate trick horse riding, nor was he first to introduce acts such as acrobats and clowns to the English public, but he was the first to create a space where all these acts were brought together to perform a show.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Astley rode in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did, and thus chanced on the format of performing in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Nickell (2005). "Secrets of the sideshows". p.8. University Press of Kentucky, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Astley performed stunts in a 42&amp;nbsp;ft diameter ring, which is the standard size used by circuses ever since.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2929565.stm "The circus comes to the Circus"]. BBC News. Retrieved December 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Astley referred to the performance arena as a Circle and the building as an amphitheatre but these were to later be known as a Circus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0719052343|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770 Astley hired [[Acrobatics|acrobats]], [[Tightrope walking|tightrope walkers]], [[jugglers]] and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Astley was followed by [[Andrew Ducrow]], whose feats of horsemanship had much to do with establishing the traditions of the circus, which were perpetuated by Henglers and Sangers celebrated shows in a later generation. In England circuses were often held in purpose built buildings in large cities, such as the [[London Hippodrome]], which was built as a combination of the circus, the menagerie and the variety theatre, where wild animals such as lions and elephants from time to time appeared in the ring, and where convulsions of nature such as floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have been produced with an extraordinary wealth of realistic display.  [[Joseph Grimaldi]], the first mainstream [[clown]], had his first major role as Little Clown in the pantomime ''The Triumph of Mirth; or, Harlequin's Wedding'' in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell Stott|, Andrew (2009), ''The Pantomime Life of Joseph Grimaldi'', Canongate Books, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Circus]] opened in London on 4 November 1782 by [[Charles Dibdin]] and his partner Charles Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/circus_tour/the_first_circus/default.php ''Mr Philip Astley's Introduction to The First Circus in England''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108114017/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/circus_tour/the_first_circus/default.php |date=2008-11-08 }}. PeoplePlay UK.

====Ricketts and the first American circus====
The Scotsman [[John Bill Ricketts]] brought the first modern circus to the United States. He began his theatrical career with Hughes Royal Circus in London in the 1780s, and travelled from England in 1792 to establish his first circus in [[Philadelphia]]. The first circus building in the US opened on April 3, 1793 in Philadelphia, where Ricketts gave America's first complete circus performance.&lt;ref name=BGH&gt;{{cite web| url= http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=815 |title= Historical Markers |publisher=Explore PA History |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/people/public_show/67|title=Person : Ricketts, John Bill|work=The Circus in America, 1793 – 1940|date=|accessdate=2012-04-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503230859/http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/people/public_show/67|archivedate=2012-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] attended a performance there later that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/DOH/markerresults.asp?secid=31&amp;namesearch=Ricketts%27+Circus&amp;Submit=Search+by+Marker+Title|title=PHMC: Historical Markers Program: Ricketts' Circus|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219024702/http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/DOH/markerresults.asp?secid=31&amp;namesearch=Ricketts%27+Circus&amp;Submit=Search+by+Marker+Title|archivedate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion of American format====
In the Americas during the first two decades of the 19th century, the [[Circus of Pepin and Breschard]] toured from Montreal to Havana, building circus theatres in many of the cities it visited. [[Victor Pépin]], a native New Yorker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/timelines?date1=1801&amp;date2=1824 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325081303/http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/timelines?date1=1801&amp;date2=1824 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-03-25 |title=Circus in America TimeLine: 1801 – 1824 |publisher=The Circus in America, 1793 – 1940 |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first American to operate a major circus in the United States.&lt;ref name="circusinamerica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/welcome|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501081904/http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/welcome|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-05-01|title=Introduction|publisher=The Circus in America, 1793 – 1940|date=|accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the establishments of Purdy, Welch &amp; Co., and of van Amburgh gave a wider popularity to the circus in the United States. In 1825, [[Joshuah Purdy Brown]] was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance. Circus pioneer [[Dan Rice]] was the most famous pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] circus clown,&lt;ref name=carlyon&gt;David Carlyon. ''Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You've Never Heard Of''&lt;/ref&gt; popularizing such expressions as "The One-Horse Show" and "[[Hey, Rube!]]". The American circus was revolutionized by [[P. T. Barnum]] and [[William Cameron Coup]], who launched the travelling [[Barnum and Bailey Circus|P. T. Barnum's Museum, Menagerie &amp; Circus]], the first [[freak show]]. Coup also introduced the first multiple ringed circuses, and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use [[circus train]]s to transport the circus between towns, a practice that continues today. 
[[File:The grand lay-out, 1874.jpg|thumb|Circus parade around tents, in lithograph by Gibson &amp; Co., 1874]]

====Touring ====
In 1838, the equestrian [[Thomas Taplin Cooke]] returned to England from the United States, bringing with him a circus tent.&lt;ref name="Slout1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Slout|title=Olympians of the Sawdust Circle: A Biographical Dictionary of the Nineteenth Century American Circus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LLFwLNPtyMC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=9 June 2013|year=1998|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=978-0-8095-1310-9|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, itinerant circuses were becoming popular in Britain.  [[William Batty]]'s circus, for example, between 1838 and 1840, travelled from Newcastle to Edinburgh and then to Portsmouth and Southampton. [[Pablo Fanque]], who is noteworthy as Britain's only black circus proprietor and who operated one of the most celebrated travelling circuses in Victorian England, erected temporary structures for his limited engagements or retrofitted existing structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=J. |last=Griffin |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Frost/Frost5.htm |title=Frost, Thomas (1881), "Circus Life and Circus Celebrities."

Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in 1866 and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga where it became extremely popular. 
[[File:Lion tamer (LOC pga.03749).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lion tamer]], in lithograph by Gibson &amp; Co., 1873]]
After an 1881 merger with [[James Anthony Bailey]] and James L. Hutchinson's circus and Barnum's death in 1891, his circus travelled to Europe as the Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including the tent and circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the 20th century.

The influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus. In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible, the traditional comic dialog of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly, while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old-fashioned equestrian feats, which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances, and by exhibitions of skill, strength and daring, requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers and often of complicated and expensive machinery.
[[File:Arturo Michelena 00.JPG|thumb|Painting by Venezuelan [[Arturo Michelena]], c. 1891, depicting a backstage area at the circus]]

====Russia====
In 1919, [[Lenin]], head of the [[USSR]], expressed a wish for the circus to become "the people's art-form", with facilities and status on par with theatre, opera and ballet. The USSR nationalized Russian circuses. In 1927, the State University of Circus and Variety Arts, better known as the Moscow Circus School, was established; performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics program. When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the 1950s, its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded.

====China====
Circuses from China, drawing on Chinese traditions of [[acrobatics]], like the [[Chinese State Circus]] are also popular touring acts.

===International awards===
The [[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.montecarlofestival.mc/ |title=International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo |publisher= Montecarlofestival.mc |date=2012-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been held in [[Monte Carlo]] since 1974 and was the first of many international awards for circus performers. From the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century, travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city. After World War II, the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment (such as television) arrived and the public's tastes became more sophisticated. From the 1960s onward, circuses attracted growing criticism from [[animal rights]] activists. Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies. Nonetheless, a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world, ranging from small family enterprises to three-ring extravaganzas. Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself.

[[Contemporary circus]] (originally known as ''nouveau cirque'') is a recent performing arts movement that originated in the 1970s in Australia, Canada, France,&lt;ref&gt;« Historique de la célèbre crise », [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''École ouverte'', n°85, February 1982, http://doc.cnac.fr/ListRecord.htm?list=link&amp;xRecord=19102592157919207749&lt;/ref&gt; the West Coast of the United States, and the United Kingdom. Contemporary circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme. Compared with the traditional circus, the contemporary genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact, on character and story development, and on the use of [[lighting design]], original music, and [[costume design]] to convey thematic or narrative content. For aesthetic or economic reasons, contemporary circus productions may sometimes be staged in theatres rather than in large outdoor tents. Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production, and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history.  Animal acts appear rarely in contemporary circus in contrast to traditional circus where animal acts have been a significant part of circus entertainment.

Early examples of ''nouveau cirque'' companies include: [[Circus Oz]], forged in Australia in 1978 from SoapBox Circus and New Circus, both founded in the early 1970s; the [[Pickle Family Circus]], founded in [[San Francisco]] in 1975; [[Ra-Ra Zoo]] in the UK in 1983, [[Nofit State Circus]] in 1984 from [[Wales]]; [[Cirque du Soleil]], founded in [[Quebec]] in 1984; and [[Archaos]] in 1986. More recent examples include: [[Teatro ZinZanni]], founded in Seattle in 1998; Quebec's [[Cirque Éloize]]; Les 7 doigts de la main (also known as The 7 Fingers);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/ |title=The 7 Fingers |publisher=Les7doigtsdelamain.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the West African Circus Baobab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circusbaobab.org/ |title=Circus Baobab |publisher=Circus Baobab |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1990s. The genre includes other circus troupes such as the Vermont-based [[Circus Smirkus]] (founded in 1987 by [[Rob Mermin]]), Le Cirque Imaginaire (later renamed Le Cirque Invisible, both founded and directed by [[Victoria Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]]), the [[Tiger Lillies]], Dislocate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dislocate.net |title=Dislocate |publisher=Dislocate |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vulcana Women's Circus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulcana.org.au/ |title=Vulcana Women's Circus |publisher=Vulcana.org.au |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jim Rose Circus|The Jim Rose Circus]] is an interesting take on the [[sideshow]]. Swedish contemporary circus company [[Cirkus Cirkör]] was founded in 1995.

The most conspicuous success story in the contemporary genre has been that of [[Cirque du Soleil]], the Canadian circus company whose estimated annual revenue now exceeds US$810&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/theater/29circ.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;hp|title=Run Away to the Circus?

Numerous circuses continue to maintain animal performers, including [[UniverSoul Circus]], and the [[Big Apple Circus]] from the United States, [[Circus Krone]] from Munich, [[Circus Royale]] and [[Lennon Bros Circus]] from Australia, [[Vazquez Hermanos Circus]], Circo Atayde Hermanos, and Hermanos Mayaror Circus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duckman |first=Hank |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/334-hermanos-mayar-circus |title=Hermanos Mayar Circus by Hank Duckman |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Mexico, and [[Moira Orfei]] Circus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moiranonsolocirco.it |title=Moira Orfei Circo official website |publisher=Moiranonsolocirco.it |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Italy, to name just a few.

A traditional circus performance is often led by a [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] who has a role similar to a [[Master of Ceremonies]]. The ringmaster presents performers, speaks to the audience, and generally keeps the show moving. The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring; large circuses may have multiple rings, like the six-ringed [[Moscow State Circus]]. A circus often travels with its own band, whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included [[brass instrument]]s, drums, [[glockenspiel]], and sometimes the distinctive sound of the [[calliope (music)|calliope]].

===Acts===
Common acts include a variety of [[acrobatics]], [[gymnastics]] (including [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] and [[trampoline]]), aerial acts (such as [[trapeze]], [[aerial silk]], [[corde lisse]]), [[contortion]], [[stilts]], and a variety of other routines. [[Juggling]] is one of the most common acts in a circus; the combination of juggling and gymnastics is called [[equilibristics]] and include acts like [[plate spinning]] and the [[rolling globe]]. Acts like these are some of the most common, and the most traditional. [[Clown]]s are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts; "clowns getting into the act" is a very familiar theme in any circus. Famous circus clowns have included [[Austin Miles]], the [[Fratellini Family]], [[Rusty Russell]], [[Emmett Kelly]], [[Grock]], and [[Bill Irwin]].

Daredevil [[Stunt performer|stunt acts]] and [[sideshow|sideshow acts]] are also parts of some circus acts, these activities may include [[human cannonball]], [[chapeaugraphy]], [[fire eating]], [[Fire breathing|breathing]], and [[Fire dancing|dancing]], [[Impalement arts|knife throwing]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic shows]], [[sword swallowing]], or [[Strongman (circus)|strongman]]. Famous sideshow performers include [[Zip the Pinhead]] and [[The Doll Family]]. A popular sideshow attraction from the early 19th century was the [[flea circus]], where fleas were attached to props and viewed through a [[Fresnel lens]].

===Animal acts===

[[Image:CircusElephantsLA.jpg|thumb|[[Elephant]]s from Cole Brothers Circus parade through downtown Los Angeles, 1953]]
[[Image:Cirkus Safari u Čakovcu - konji.jpg|thumb|[[gorilla]]s [[horse]] act]]

A variety of animals have historically been used in acts. While the types of animals used vary from circus to circus, [[big cat]]s, [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[horse]]s, [[bird]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[bear]]s, and domestic animals such as [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s are the most common.

The earliest involvement of animals in circus was just the display of exotic creatures in a [[menagerie]]. Going as far back as the early eighteenth century, exotic animals were transported to North America for display, and menageries were a popular form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-magazine.com/kk/circuses.html |title=The history of circus in the US, '&amp;#39;HistoryMagazine'&amp;#39; |publisher=History-magazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414221351/http://www.history-magazine.com/kk/circuses.html |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first true animals acts in the circus were equestrian acts. Soon elephants and big cats were displayed as well. [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh]] entered a cage with several big cats in 1833, and is generally considered to be the first wild animal trainer in American circus history.&lt;ref name="circusinamerica" /&gt; [[Mabel Stark]] was a famous female tiger-tamer.

=====Animals acts controversy and laws in the United States=====
According to PETA, although the US [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] does not permit any sort of punishment that puts the animals in discomfort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |title=Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations |publisher=Nal.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416104435/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; trainers will still go against this law and use such things as electric rods and bull hooks.&lt;ref name=abuse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=66 |title=Circuses: Three Rings of Abuse |publisher=Peta.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726045752/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=66 |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson &amp; Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to "beat the elephants with a [[bullhook]] as hard as they can and sink the sharp metal hook into the elephant's flesh and twist it until they scream in pain."&lt;ref name=abuse/&gt;

On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands, [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen University]] conducted an investigation into the welfare of circus animals in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/bestanden/documenten-en-publicaties/kamerstukken/2008/02/19/onderzoek-circusdieren/20080219-dl-2008-344.pdf|date=19 February 2008|title=19 february 2008 – Projectvoorstel Ministerie LNV onderzoek welzijn circusdieren|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following issues, among others, were found:

* 71% of the observed animals had medical problems
* 33% of tigers and lions did not have access to an outdoor enclosure
* Lions spend on average 98% of their time indoors
* An average enclosure for tigers is only 5 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Elephants are shackled in chains for 17 hours a day on average
* Elephants spend on average 10 hours a day showing [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypic behaviour]]
* Tigers are terrified of fire but are still forced to jump through fire rings
* Since 1990 there have been over 123 cases of lion attacks at circuses
* Animals are trained through discipline.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

Based on these findings, the researchers called for more stringent regulation regarding the welfare of circus animals. In 2012, the Dutch government announced a ban on the use of wild circus animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/32034/dutch-government-announces-ban-use-wild-animals-circuses|title=Dutch government announces ban on the use of wild animals in circuses|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=19 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514200606/http://www.eturbonews.com/32034/dutch-government-announces-ban-use-wild-animals-circuses|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testimony in [[U.S. District Court]] in 2009, [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] CEO [[Kenneth Feld]] acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind the ears, under the chin and on their legs with metal tipped prods, called bull hooks. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers. Feld also acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant, which Feld also stated was appropriate practice. Feld denied that any of these practices harm elephants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iIvnEu-D_CqeGOboBYNAvQvp8EvQD96MTJS80 Circus CEO says elephants are struck, but not hurt]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its January 2010 verdict on the case, brought against Feld Entertainment International by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals et al., the Court ruled that evidence against the circus company was "not credible with regard to the allegations".&lt;ref&gt;Court Record, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No 03-2006 (EGS)&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of a [[USDA]] hearing, [[Feld Entertainment, Inc.|Feld Entertainment Inc]].

A 14-year litigation against the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus came to an end in 2014 when [[The Humane Society of the United States]] and a number of other animal rights groups paid a $16 million settlement to Feld Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Heath|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/ringling-circus-prevails-in-14-year-legal-case-collects-16m-from-humane-society-others/2014/05/16/50ce00b8-dd15-11e3-8009-71de85b9c527_story.html|title=Ringling Circus prevails in 14-year legal case; collects $16M from Humane Society, others|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the circus closed in May 2017 after a 146-year run when it experienced a steep decline in ticket sales during the year after it discontinued its elephant act and sent its [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]s to a reserve.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite news|first=Amy B|last=Wang|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/01/15/animal-activists-finally-have-something-to-applaud-at-the-ringling-bros-circus-its-closure/|title=Animal activists finally have something to applaud at Ringling Bros. circus: Its closure|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2017-01-15|accessdate=2017-06-12|quote=In 2015, Ringling Bros. announced it would stop using elephants in its shows.

The litigation ended with several animal groups paying a $16 million settlement to Feld.&lt;br&gt;While the animal activists never prevailed against Ringling in court, they were victorious outside. The allegations of elephant abuse prompted municipalities around the country to ban elephant bullhooks — a sharp metal tool used by handlers — or to prohibit wild animal performances altogether, as Los Angeles recently moved to do. After Ringling retired its last pachyderms to a company-owned elephant conservation center in Florida, ticket sales declined much more than Feld expected, and the company announced in January that Ringling would close for good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 1992 at the Great American Circus in [[Palm Bay, Florida]], an elephant named Janet (1965 – February 1, 1992) went out of control while giving a ride to a mother, her two children, and three other children.

=====Animals acts controversy and laws in the EU and the UK=====
In 2018 in Germany, an accident with an elephant during a circus performance, prompted calls to ban animal performances in circuses. PETA called the countries politicians to outlaw the keeping of animals for circuses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/circus-elephant-falls-into-crowd-germany-cruelty-to-animals-osnabruck-a8436166.html|title=Circus elephant falls into audience in Germany|work=The Independent |date=2018-07-08 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 in the UK, a parliamentary working group chaired by MP [[Roger Gale]] studied living conditions and treatment of animals in UK circuses. All members of this group agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, "It's undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate—the cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe the time has come for that practice to end." The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the [[Wildlife Conservation Research Unit]] at [[Oxford University]] "found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/201483.stm |title=UK Politics Protect circus animals call |work=BBC News |date=1998-10-26 |accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of "scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom." According to that group's report, published in October 2007, "there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091106081209/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/documents/circus-report.pdf "Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses: The Report of the Chairman of the Circus Working Group".] UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

A ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in Britain was due to be passed in 2015, but Conservative MP [[Christopher Chope]] repeatedly blocked the bill under the reasoning that "The EU Membership Costs and Benefits bill should have been called by the clerk before the circuses bill, so I raised a point of order".

This causes a huge amount of distress to animals and leads to excessive amounts of drooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17169-circus-captivity-is-beastly-for-wild-animals/|title=Circus captivity is beastly for wild animals|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason being the high chance of the animals to harm someone in the audience. This is due to their instincts which they cannot control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-circus-california/san-francisco-board-approves-wild-animal-performance-ban-idUSKBN0N62QK20150415|title=San Francisco board approves wild animal performance ban|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greece became the first European country to ban any animal from performing in any circus in its territory in February 2012, following a campaign by [[Animal Defenders International]] and the Greek Animal Welfare Fund (GAWF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad-international.org/animals_in_entertainment/go.php?id=2528&amp;ssi=10 Greece bans animal circuses], Animal Defenders International&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2015, the [[Federation of Veterinarians of Europe]] adopted a position paper in which it recommends the prohibition of the use of [[Wildlife|wild animals]] in traveling circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fve.org/uploads/publications/docs/fve_position_on_the_travelling_circuses_adopted_final.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924020236/http://www.fve.org/uploads/publications/docs/fve_position_on_the_travelling_circuses_adopted_final.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-09-24|title = FVE position on the use of animals in travelling circuses|date = |accessdate = |website = Federation of Veterinarians of Europe|publisher = Federation of Veterinarians of Europe|last = |first = |format = PDF|series = FVE/013/pos/007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/596390/vets-Europe-animal-acts-circus|title = Vets call for complete ban on wild animal acts in circuses across Europe|last = Winter|first = Stuart|date = 2015-08-05|work = Express.co.uk|access-date = 2015-08-08|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmosphere of the circus has served as a dramatic setting for many musicians. The most famous circus theme song is called "[[Entrance of the Gladiators]]", and was composed in 1904 by [[Julius Fučík (composer)|Julius Fučík]]. Other circus music includes "El Caballero", "Quality Plus", "Sunnyland Waltzes", "The Storming of El Caney", "Pahjamah", "Bull Trombone", "Big Time Boogie", "Royal Bridesmaid March", "The Baby Elephant Walk", "Liberty Bell March", "Java", Strauss's "Radetsky March", and "Pageant of Progress".  A poster for [[Pablo Fanque]]'s Circus Royal, one of the most popular circuses of Victorian England, inspired [[John Lennon]] to write [[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]] on [[The Beatles]]' album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.  The song title refers to [[William Kite]], a well-known circus performer in the 19th century. Producer [[George Martin]] and [[EMI]] engineers created the song's fairground atmosphere by assembling a sound collage of collected recordings of calliopes and fairground organs, which they cut into strips of various lengths, threw into a box, and then mixed up and edited together randomly, creating a long loop which was mixed into the final production.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Steve, "A Hard Day's Write." HarperCollins(1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional circus song is the [[John Philip Sousa]] march "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]", which is played only to alert circus performers of an emergency.

Plays set in a circus include the 1896 musical ''The Circus Girl'' by [[Lionel Monckton]], ''Polly of the Circus'' written in 1907 by [[Margaret Mayo (playwright)|Margaret Mayo]], ''He Who Gets Slapped'' written by Russian [[Leonid Andreyev]] 1916 and later adapted into one of the first circus films, ''Katharina Knie'' written in 1928 by [[Carl Zuckmayer]] and adapted for the English stage in 1932 as ''Caravan'' by playwright Cecily Hamilton, the revue ''Big Top'' written by [[Herbert Farjeon]] in 1942, ''Top of the Ladder'' written by [[Tyrone Guthrie]] in 1950, ''Stop the World, I Want to Get Off'' written by [[Anthony Newley]] in 1961, and ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'' with music by [[Cy Coleman]] and lyrics and book by [[Mark Bramble]], ''Roustabout: The Great Circus Train Wreck'' written by [[Jay Torrence]] in 2006.

Following World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' was the first film released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]; in 1925 ''Sally of the Sawdust'' (remade 1930), ''[[Variety (1925 film)|Variety]]'', and ''Vaudeville'' were produced, followed by ''The Devil's Circus'' in 1926 and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' starring [[Charlie Chaplin]], ''Circus Rookies'', ''[[4 Devils]]''; and ''Laugh Clown Laugh'' in 1928. German film ''[[Salto Mortale (1931 German film)|Salto Mortale]]'' about trapeze artists was released in 1931 and remade in the United States and released as ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' starring [[Burt Lancaster]] in 1956; in 1932 ''[[Freaks]]'' was released; ''Charlie Chan at the Circus'', ''Circus'' (USSR) and ''The Three Maxiums'' were released in 1936 and ''[[At the Circus]]'' starring the [[Marx Brothers]] and ''You Can't Cheat an Honest Man'' in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included ''The Great Profile'' starring [[John Barrymore]] (1940), the animated [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), ''Road Show'' (1941), ''[[The Wagons Roll at Night]]'' (1941) and ''Captive Wild Woman'' (1943).

''Tromba'', a film about a tiger trainer, was released in 1948. In 1952 [[Cecil B. de Mille]]'s Oscar-winning film ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' was first shown. Released in 1953 were ''Man on a Tightrope'' and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''Gycklarnas afton'' (released as ''Sawdust and Tinsel'' in the United States); these were followed by ''Life Is a Circus''; ''Ring of Fear''; ''[[3 Ring Circus]]'' (1954) and ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), an Oscar-winning film by [[Federico Fellini]] about a girl who is sold to a circus strongman. Fellini made a second film set in the circus called ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'' in 1970. Films about the circus made since 1959 include Disney's ''[[Toby Tyler]]'' (1960), the [[B-movie]] ''[[Circus of Horrors]]'' (also in 1960); the [[musical film]] ''[[Billy Rose's Jumbo (film)|Billy Rose's Jumbo]]'' (1962); ''A Tiger Walks'', a Disney film about a tiger that escapes from the circus; and ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964), starring [[John Wayne]]. [[Mera Naam Joker]] (1970) a Hindi drama film directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] which was about a clown who must make his audience laugh at the cost of his own sorrows.  In the film ''[[Jungle Emperor Leo]]'' (1997), Leo's son Lune is captured and placed in a circus, which burns down when a tiger knocks down a ring of fire while jumping through it. ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'', a musical film loosely based on the life of [[P. T. Barnum]], was released in 2017. 

The TV series ''[[Circus Humberto]]'', based on the novel by [[Eduard Bass]], follows the history of the circus family Humberto between 1826 and 1924. The setting of the HBO television series ''[[Carnivàle]]'', which ran from 2003 to 2005, is also largely set in a travelling circus. The circus has also inspired many writers. Numerous books, both non-fiction and fiction, have been published about circus life. Notable examples of circus-based fiction include ''[[Circus Humberto]]'' by [[Eduard Bass]], ''[[Cirque du Freak]]'' by [[Darren Shan]], and ''[[Spangle (novel)|Spangle]]'' by [[Gary Jennings]].  The novel ''[[Water for Elephants]]'' by [[Sara Gruen]] tells the fictional tale of a circus veterinarian and was made into a [[Water for Elephants (film)|movie with the same title]], starring [[Robert Pattinson]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]].

Circus is the central theme in comic books of [[Super Commando Dhruva]], an Indian comic book superhero. According to this series, Dhruva was born and brought up in a fictional Indian circus called Jupiter Circus. When a rival circus burnt down Jupiter Circus, killing everyone in it, including Dhruva's parents, Dhruva vowed to become a crime fighter. A circus-based television series called ''[[Circus (TV series)|Circus]]'' was also telecast in India in 1989 on [[DD National]], starring [[Shahrukh Khan]] as the lead actor.

'''Daryl "Chill" Mitchell''' (born 16 July 1965)&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; is an American [[actor]]. He is known for such roles as Dexter Walker on ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'', Tommy Webber in ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', Leo Michaels on ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'', Eli Goggins III on ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'', and Patton Plame on ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''.
==Early life and career==
Mitchell was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to a secretary mother and a bus driver father.&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/62/Daryl-Mitchell.html|title=Daryl Mitchell Biography (1969-)|work=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Wyandanch, New York|Wyandanch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137620,00.html Moving Man - Personal Tragedy, Veronica's Closet, Coping and Overcoming Illness, Daryl Mitchell : People.com] Retrieved 2014-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; After a career in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in the 1980s with ''Groove B. Chill'', Mitchell had considerable success as an actor, appearing in ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' and its [[House Party 2|sequel]], ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', and the TV [[sitcom]]s ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'' and ''[[Veronica's Closet]]''. He has also made appearances in the sitcom ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and in ''[[The Game (U.S. TV series)|The Game]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.  In 2009, he co-starred in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Brothers (2009 TV series)|Brothers]]''. Since 2014 he has guest-starred in ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' as recurring-turned-main character Patton Plame, a computer specialist for NCIS.

In September 2009, Mitchell was profiled on [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s biographical documentary program ''Life After'', a series that examines the lives of celebrities following a career turning point.

==Personal life==
In November 2001, Mitchell was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down in a [[motorcycle]] accident in [[South Carolina]]. "It was dark and I didn't know the roads really well," said Mitchell, "I went around a bend and on the other side there was gravel and loose pavement and bam, the bike shot right underneath me. I woke up five days later in the hospital." "It was a blessing," explained Mitchell, to have a friend, who was once shot in a random act of violence, be "one of the first people to show up at the hospital." Spending much time with him previously, doing things and going places, really helped Mitchell to better understand his circumstances.&lt;ref name="ABILITYMagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Daryl-Chill-Mitchell.html|title=Daryl "Chill" Mitchell|date=Aug–Sep 2010|publisher=ABILITY Magazine|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell got full support from his family and friends, including [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Chris Tucker]], to continue his career. Mitchell advises other wheelchair users to hold on to something they believe in. "You cannot do this by yourself. You need your family, your friends, faith, and love," he said.

After the accident, he appeared on the TV program ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'' between 2002 and 2004 as a [[bowling alley]] manager who was paralyzed after an accident similar to Mitchell's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,81160,00.html|title=Ed Star Daryl Mitchell on Rolling With Life's Punches|last=Straka|first=Mike |date=2003-03-13|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later started the Daryl Mitchell Foundation to raise awareness of spinal cord injuries and serves as the Minority Outreach spokesman for the [[Christopher Reeve Foundation]]. He has also become a strong advocate for employing actors with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Daryl-Chill-Mitchell.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Daryl "Chill" Mitchell"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mitchell resides in [[Sugar Hill, Georgia]]&lt;ref name="ABILITYMagazine"/&gt; with his wife and three children. His two sons play [[American football|football]] for [[North Gwinnett High School]], while his daughter also cheers for North Gwinnett High.&lt;ref name="filmr" /&gt; Mitchell won an [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] Image Award on February 26, 2010.

'''Design''' is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different [[connotation]]s in different fields (see [[#Design disciplines|design disciplines]] below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in [[pottery]], [[engineering]], management, [[software development|coding]], and [[graphic design]]) is also considered to use design thinking.

Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]], economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable [[research]], [[thought]], [[Physical model|modeling]], interactive [[problem solving|adjustment]], and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including [[clothing]], [[graphical user interface]]s, products, skyscrapers, [[corporate identity|corporate identities]], [[business process]]es, and even methods or processes of designing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brinkkemper, S. |year=1996|title= Method engineering: engineering of information systems development methods and tools|journal= Information and Software Technology |volume=38|issue=4|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/0950-5849(95)01059-9|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/18012/1/Brinkkemper96method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.

== Definitions ==
More formally design has been defined as follows:
{{Quote|(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment (systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 109 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another definition for design is "a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective."&lt;ref&gt;Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed.

The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called [[design science]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eekels, J. |year=2000|title=On the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Science: The Geography of Engineering Design Science, Part 1|journal= Journal of Engineering Design |volume=11|pages=377–397|doi=10.1080/09544820010000962|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design theory"&gt;Braha, D. and Maimon, O. (1998) A Mathematical Theory of Design, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word "design" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.

While the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.

Major examples of design are [[blueprint|architectural blueprints]], [[engineering drawing]]s, [[business process]]es, [[circuit diagram]]s, and [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary meanings in the [//dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/design Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [//www.dictionary.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1–5 and 7–8) and at [//en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/design AskOxford] (esp. verbs).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design as a process{{anchor|Process}}==
Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "technical problem solving"&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"&gt;Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and "the reason-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"&gt;Ralph 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt; "evolutionary design",&lt;ref name="design theory"/&gt; "co-evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Cross 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and "the action-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

===The rational model===
The rational model was independently developed by [[Herb Simon|Herbert A. Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt; an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl and Beitz 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that:
# designers attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] a design candidate for known [[constraint optimization|constraints]] and [[Goal|objectives]],
# the design process is plan-driven,
# the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.

The rational model is based on a [[Rationalism|rationalist philosophy]]&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; and underlies the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems development life cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Bourque and Dupuis 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the [[engineering design]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

====Example sequence of stages====
Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:
* Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] or ''[[Parti pris]]''&amp;nbsp;– an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals
** [[Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]]&amp;nbsp;– investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]]&amp;nbsp;– specifying requirements of a design solution for a product ([[product design specification]])&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., 2006. T211 Design and Designing: Block 2, p. 99. Milton Keynes: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; or service.
** [[Problem solving]]&amp;nbsp;– [[wikt:conceptualize|conceptualizing]] and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]]&amp;nbsp;– presenting design solutions
* Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]]&amp;nbsp;– continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** Testing&amp;nbsp;– ''[[in situ]]'' testing of a designed solution
* Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]&amp;nbsp;– introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[logical consequence|conclusion]]&amp;nbsp;– summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
* Redesign&amp;nbsp;– any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

Each stage has many associated [[best practices]].&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, David G. (2009) The Mechanical Design Process, Mc Graw Hill, 4th edition {{ISBN|0-07-297574-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of the rational model====
The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:

# Designers do not work this way&amp;nbsp;– extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"&gt;Cross et al. 1992; Ralph 2010; Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic assumptions&amp;nbsp;– goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2010; McCracken and Jackson 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===The action-centric model===
The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt; It posits that:

# designers use [[creativity]] and [[emotion]] to generate design candidates,
# the design process is [[Improvisation|improvised]],
# no universal sequence of stages is apparent&amp;nbsp;– analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

The action-centric perspective is based on an [[Empiricism|empiricist philosophy]] and broadly consistent with the [[Agile software development|agile approach]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and amethodical development.&lt;ref&gt;Truex et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"/&gt; Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&amp;nbsp;– by designers "thinking on their feet"&amp;nbsp;– more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.

====Descriptions of design activities====
At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.

In the [[Reflective practice|reflection-in-action paradigm]], designers alternate between "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]", "making moves", and "evaluating moves". "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt;

In the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. [[Sensemaking (information science)|Sensemaking]] includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[design cycle]] is understood as a circular time structure,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fischer: ''Design Enigma. A typographical metaphor for enigmatic processes, including designing'', in: T. Fischer, K. De Biswas, J.J. Ham, R. Naka, W.X. Huang, Beyond Codes and Pixels: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies and studies of design==
There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought{{which|date=February 2018}} and among practicing designers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most [[holistic]] influential [[utopian]] goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.  John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskett|first1=John|title=Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies for guiding design===
Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on [[material culture]] and environmental concerns ([[sustainable design]]) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]] which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&amp;nbsp;– a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref name="maxbruinsma.nl"&gt;[http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm First Things First 2000 a design manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |date=2011-12-19 }}. manifesto published jointly by 33 signatories in: Adbusters, the AIGA journal, Blueprint, Emigre, Eye, Form, Items fall 1999/spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' by polymath [[Herbert A. Simon]], the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design."&lt;ref name="Herbert A. Simon 1996"&gt;Simon (1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to design===
A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.

Some popular approaches include:
* [[Sociotechnical system]] design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes - for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society
* [[KISS principle]], (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications.
* [[There is more than one way to do it]] (TIMTOWTDI), a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing.
* [[Use-centered design]], which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
* [[User-centered design]], which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.
* [[Critical design]] uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
* [[Service design]] designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.
* [[Transgenerational design]], the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.
* Speculative design, the speculative design process doesn't necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings.
* [[Participatory design|Participatory Design]] (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/manila/gems/contextmapping/PreprintDraft.pdf|title=Co-creation and the new landscape of design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of designing===
{{Main article|Design methods}}
Design methods is a broad area that focuses on:
* [[Exploring]] possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]—or the creation of new categories (see also [[Brainstorming]])
* [[Definition|Redefining]] the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities (graphic, industrial, architectural, etc.);
* [[Management|Managing]] the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time
* [[Prototyping]] possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation
* Trendspotting; understanding the trend process.

==Terminology==
The word "design" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.
[[File:M-T4.jpg|thumb|166px|left|The new terminal at [[Barajas airport]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]

===Design and art===
Today, the term design is widely associated with the [[applied arts]] as initiated by [[Raymond Loewy]] and teachings at the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Ulm School of Design]] (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. [[Applied arts]] has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], etc. The term '[[decorative arts]]' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of [[applied arts]]. In [[graphic art]]s (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between [[fine art]] and [[commercial art]], based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the [[applied arts]] and [[fine art]]. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Getlein, ''Living With Art'', 8th ed. (New York: 2008) 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to design, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]

===Design and engineering===
In [[engineering]], design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing [[Product design]], [[Industrial design]] and [[Engineering]]. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] defines design as: ''"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,"'' and ''"To formulate a plan"'', and defines engineering as: ''"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108172005/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design |date=2007-01-08 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102052421/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering |date=2007-01-02 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.&lt;ref&gt;Faste 2001&lt;/ref&gt; How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "[[science]]". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is [[social science]] versus [[natural science]]. Scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] made the distinction of design versus engineering at "moving minds" versus "moving atoms" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term "engineering - engineer" from Latin "in genio" in meaning of a "genius" what assumes existence of a "mind" not of an "atom").

[[File:Aluminium MacBook.png|thumb|166px|left|[[Jonathan Ive]] has received several awards for his design of [[Apple Inc.]] products like this MacBook. In some design fields, [[personal computer]]s are also used for both design and production]]

===Design and production===
The relationship between design and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and [[creativity]]. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad [[multidisciplinary]] knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed [[Division of labour|specialized]] knowledge of how to produce the product.

Design and production are intertwined in many [[creative professional]] careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a [[skyscraper]], requires separating (design) [[architect]]ure from (production) [[construction]]. A Low-budget project, such as a [[Multifunction printer|locally printed]] office party invitation [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]], can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a [[desktop publishing|desktop publisher]].

This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. [[production artist]], [[construction worker]]) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.

===Process design===
{{See also|Business process management|Method engineering}}
"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned [[#Design as a process|above]]) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial [[Process design (chemical engineering)|designing of]] [[chemical process]]es. With the increasing complexities of the [[information age]], consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the [[Business process modeling|design of business processes]] as well as [[manufacturing|manufacturing processes]].

The center contains facilities for exhibitions, a theatre, a library, a cinema and a [[planetarium]]. The center was inaugurated in April 1999, and has an overall area of 33 000 m². The name "Dragão do Mar" is in honour of [[Francisco José do Nascimento]], a hero of the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement in Ceará, who in 1881 refused to transport slaves to be sold further south in the country.

==Cultural Places==
[[Image:CDMAC.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A view of the upper portion of the center.]]
The Dragão do Mar Center of Art And Culture congregates many spaces destinated to the realization of the most different activities, where the urban leisure, the production and diffusion of art and culture are the main focus. 

On your almost 30 thousand square meters of area, includes spaces like ''Cearense Culture Memorial'', the ''Contemporary Art Museum of Ceará'', the ''Menezes Pimentel Public Library'', a modern theater room, two cinema rooms, the ''Rubens de Azevedo Planetarium'', the ''Sérgio Mota Open Theatre'', an auditorium and classrooms. 

*'''Menezes Pimentel Public Library''': located on leisure and culture complex of the Dragão do Mar Center of Art and Culture, makes possible the entrance of the visitors by two ways, one by the Presidente Castelo Branco Avenue and the other by the main entrance of Dragão do Mar Center. An important research source for students, teachers and researchers, the Public Library Menezes Pimentel have a quantity composed by 70 thousand books and 40 thousand titles. It makes use of the fourth bigger quantity of Rare Titles of the country, where the 19th century newspaper collection and the 15th century book collection takes place.
*'''Cearense Culture Memorial''' The folk history, art and culture of [[Ceará]] could be saw in this equipment with 800 square meters, divided in six rooms.
*'''Contemporary Art Museum of Ceará''': it occupies the place of two floors and have 700 square meters of area.
*'''[[Rubens de Azevedo]] Planetarium ''': built with German technology, is one of the most modern in the world, is the only one in Brazil that project the rainbow by 20 multimedia projectors.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Implementation''' is the realization of an application, or execution of a [[plan]], idea, [[scientific modelling|model]], [[design]], [[specification]], [[Standardization|standard]], [[algorithm]], or [[policy]].

==Industry-specific definitions==

===Computer science===
{{see|Software implementation (disambiguation)}}
In [[computer science]], an implementation is a realization of a [[technical specification]] or algorithm as a [[computer program|program]], [[software component]], or other [[computer system]] through [[computer programming]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]].  Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.  For example, [[web browser]]s contain implementations of [[World Wide Web Consortium]]-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain implementations of [[programming languages]].

A special case occurs in [[object-oriented programming]], when a [[concrete class|concrete]] [[class (object-oriented programming)|class]] implements an [[interface (object-oriented programming)|interface]]; in this case the concrete class is an ''implementation'' of the interface and it includes methods which are ''implementations'' of those [[method (object-oriented programming)|method]]s specified by the interface.

===Information technology===
{{AP|Information technology}}
In the [[information technology]] [[industry]], implementation refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customizations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using [[project management]] methodologies. Software Implementations involve several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as [[Business analysis|business analysts]], [[Technical analysis|technical analysts]], [[solutions architect]]s, and project managers.

To implement a system successfully, a large number of inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an implementation project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

===Political science===
{{AP|Political science}}
In [[political science]], implementation refers to the carrying out of [[public policy]].  [[Legislatures]] pass laws that are then carried out by [[public servants]] working in [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic agencies]].  This process consists of rule-making, rule-administration and rule-adjudication.  Factors impacting implementation include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the implementing bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and presidential or executive support.

In international relations, implementation refers to a stage of international treaty-making. It represents the stage when international provisions are enacted domestically through legislation and regulation. The implementation stage is different from the ratification of an international treaty.

===Social and health sciences===
Implementation is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions.  According to this definition, implementation processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the "specific set of activities" related to implementation.  In addition, the activity or program being implemented is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength."&lt;ref name="NIRN2014"&gt;The National Implementation Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and natural resources===
In water and natural resources, implementation refers to the actualization of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.

====Types====
* [[Direct changeover]]
* [[Parallel running]], also known as parallel
* [[Phased implementation]]
* [[Pilot introduction]], also known as pilot
* [[Well-trade]]

==Role of end users==
System implementation generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome.  Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems implementation efforts.  Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities.  This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap.  These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt; Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

===User concerns===
* Will the system deliver the information I need for my work?
* How quickly can I access the data?
* How easily can I retrieve the data?
* How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system?
* How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"&gt;Laudon, K., &amp; Laudon, J. (2010). "Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm." Eleventh  Edition (11 ed.). New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designer concerns===
* How much disk storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Indigenous intellectual property''' is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify [[indigenous peoples]]' claims of [[intellectual property]] rights to protect specific cultural knowledge of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK (1993) &lt;u&gt;''Julayinbul: Aboriginal Intellectual and Cultural Property Definitions, Ownership and Strategies for Protection.''&lt;/u&gt; Rainforest Aboriginal Network. Cairns. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 31: "Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kari-Oca Declaration and Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter, May 1992 ===

The Kari-Oca Declaration and [[charter]] was first affirmed in [[Brazil]] in May 1992, and then re-affirmed in [[Indonesia]], in June 2002. Ratifying the document were Indigenous peoples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Pacific who, at Kari-Oca Villages, united in one voice to collectively express their serious concern at the way the world was exploiting the natural resources upon which indigenous peoples depend.

Specific reference is made within the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter to perceived abuses of indigenous people's intellectual and cultural properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrietta Marrie|FOURMILE, Henrietta]] (1996) "Making things work: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Involvement in Bioregional Planning" in ''Approaches to bioregional planning.

===Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, June 1993===

At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality."&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; Representatives affirmed a zero-tolerance policy on the exploitation of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Whereas''' ''we are conveners of an ongoing series of comprehensive forums on the abuse and exploitation of Lakota spirituality; and''&lt;br /&gt;

''We urge traditional people, tribal leaders, and governing councils of all other Indian Nations, as well as all national Indian organizations, to join us in calling for an immediate end to this rampant exploitation of our respective American Indian sacred traditions by issuing statements denouncing such abuse; for it is not the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people alone whose spiritual practices are being systematically violated by non-Indians.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''7.'''  ''We urge all our Indian brothers and sisters to act decisively and boldly in our present campaign to end the destruction of our sacred traditions, keeping in mind that our highest duty as Indian people: to preserve the purity of our precious traditions for future generations, so that our children and our children's children will survive and prosper in the sacred manner intended for each of our respective peoples by our Creator.''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples, June, 1993===

On 18 June 1993, 150 delegates from fourteen countries, including indigenous representatives from  Japan ([[Ainu people|Ainu]]), Australia, [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], India, [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Surinam]], United States and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) met at Whakatane ([[Bay of Plenty]] region of New Zealand). The assembly '''affirmed''' Indigenous peoples' knowledge is of benefit to all humanity; '''recognised''' Indigenous peoples are willing to offer their knowledge to all humanity provided their fundamental rights to define and control this knowledge is protected by the international community; '''insisted''' the first beneficiaries of Indigenous knowledge must be the direct Indigenous descendants of such knowledge; and '''declared''' all forms of exploitation of Indigenous knowledge must cease.&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"&gt;FOURMILE page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 2 of their declaration they specifically ask State, National and International Agencies to:&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.1''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples are the guardians of their customary knowledge and have the right to protect and control dissemination of that knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.2''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples also have the right to create new knowledge based on cultural tradition"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.3''': Accept that the cultural and intellectual property rights of Indigenous peoples are vested with those who created them.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Julayinbul Statement on Indigenous Intellectual Property Rights, November 1993===
[[File:JulayinbulIP.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Julayinbul Aboriginal Intellectual Property Conference Logo (1993)]]
This declaration arose out of a meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous specialists, who, at [[Daintree, Queensland|Jingarrba]], in north-eastern Australia, agreed Indigenous intellectual property rights are best determined from within the [[Custom (law)|customary law]]s of the Indigenous groups' themselves.&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE page 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the declaration, Indigenous customary laws are (re)named 'Aboriginal common laws', and it is insisted these laws must be acknowledged and treated as equal to any other systems of law:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 264&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations reaffirm their right to define for themselves their own intellectual property, acknowledging...the uniqueness of their own particular heritage.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations...declare that we...are willing to share [our intellectual property] with all humanity provided that our fundamental rights to define and control this property are recognised by the international community...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aboriginal intellectual property, within Aboriginal Common Law, is an inherent, inalienable right which cannot be terminated, extinguished, or taken... Any use of the intellectual property of Aboriginal Nations and Peoples may only be done in accordance with Aboriginal Common Law, and any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited."&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK Pages 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Santa Cruz de la Sierra Statement on Intellectual Property, September, 1994===

A regional meeting was held at [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]] where indigenous peoples from the South America's concerned about the way internationally prevailing intellectual property systems and regimes appeared to be favouring the appropriation of indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources for commercial purposes, agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR02"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For members of indigenous peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and intergenerational. No...individuals or communities, nor the Government, can sell or transfer ownership of [cultural] resources which are the property of the people and which each generation has an obligation to safeguard for the next.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Work must be conducted on the design of a protection and recognition system which is in accordance with ..our own conception, and mechanisms must be developed .. which will prevent appropriation of our resources and knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''There must be appropriate mechanisms for maintaining and ensuring the right of Indigenous peoples to deny indiscriminate access to the [cultural] resources of our communities or peoples and making it possible to contest patents or other exclusive rights to what is essentially Indigenous.''&lt;ref name="FOUR02"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tambunan Statement on the Protection and Conservation of Indigenous Knowledge, February, 1995===

Indigenous people of Asia met at [[Tambunan]], [[Sabah]], East [[Malaysia]], to assert rights of self-determination, and to express concern about, and fear of, the threat unfamiliar 'western' intellectual property rights systems may pose to them.  It was agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR003"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For the Indigenous peoples of Asia, the intellectual property rights system is not only a very new concept but it is also very western...[W]ith [western style] intellectual property property rights, alien laws will be devised to exploit the Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources of the Indigenous peoples.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Indigenous peoples are not benefiting from the intellectual property rights system.  Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources are being eroded, exploited and/or appropriated by outsiders in the likes of transnational corporations, institutions, researchers, and scientists who are after profits and benefits gained..''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"For indigenous peoples, life is a common property which cannot be owned, commercialized, and monopolised...Based on this world view, Indigenous peoples find it difficult to relate [western] intellectual property rights...to their daily lives...''&lt;ref name="FOUR003"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suva Statement on Indigenous Peoples Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, April 1995===

Participants from the independent countries and "nonautonomous colonised territories" of the Pacific region met in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] to discuss internationally dominant intellectual property rights regimes, and at that meeting they resolved to support the Kari Oca, Mataatua, Julayinbul, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Tambunan initiatives&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;(above).  In particular participants:&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reaffirme[d] that imperialism is perpetuated through [western] intellectual property rights systems...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Declar[ed] Indigenous peoples are willing to share our knowledge with humanity provided we determine when, where and how it is used: at present the international system does not recognise or respect our past, present and potential contribution...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Seek[s] repatriation of Indigenous peoples [cultural] resources already held in external collections, and seek[s] compensation and royalties from commercial developments resulting from these resources''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...encourage[s]...governments...to protest against any [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] provisions which facilitate the expropriation of Indigenous peoples'  knowledge and resources...[to instead] incorporate the concerns of Indigenous peoples...into legislation...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[Seek to] Strengthen the capacities of Indigenous peoples to maintain their oral traditions, and encourage initiatives by Indigenous peoples to record their knowledge .. according to their customary access procedures.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Urge universities, churches, government, non-government organizations, and other institutions to reconsider their roles in the expropriation of Indigenous people's knowledge and resources and to assist in their return to their rightful owners."''&lt;ref name="FOUR004"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

([[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] August 2002)

Indigenous people from around the world attended an international indigenous peoples' summit on sustainable development in Khoi-San Territory, [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], where they reaffirmed previous declarations and statements (above), and, amongst other matters, declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our traditional knowledge systems must be respected, promoted and protected; our collective intellectual property rights must be guaranteed and ensured. Our traditional knowledge is not in the public domain; it is collective, cultural and intellectual property protected under our customary law.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 11''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.''&lt;ref&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 24''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals...''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 31''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights."''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism and Problems ==
Theory for intellectual property/privilege law is give creators temporary government monopoly for help creators earn their investments (patents and copyrights) but with idea after monopoly terminates everything becomes public domain for help create new innovation. Because of this theory, use intellectual property/privilege for control culture create many problems:

• Most culture items are too old for patent or copyright.  Additionally, often the author or creator unknown.

• Registration is not filed and fees are not paid

• Natural languages lie within the public domain

• Art styles lie within the public domain

• Properties of fauna and flora are scientific fact and their discovery and description can't have intellectual privilege for facts or information. Fauna and flora evolved, not created by humans.

• Can't own culture, it belongs to every person that uses it. This causes problems with human rights like expression freedom and choice.

• Cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions lie in the public domain.

• Powerful indigenous cultures in Europa (English, Italianos, Russians, etc) and Asia (Hindustanis, Han Chinese, etc.) can reverse this and forbid indigenous people from their culture (modern medicine, science, mathematics, printing, combustion engines, computer, etc) and languages (like English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) and religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, etc.)

• Indigenous people consume more outside culture than they can give

• Intellectual property owners must pay maintenance fee (patents).

• Proponents have not offered a solid concept of collective intellectual property rights, need a specific owner that can follow laws and must accept liability in courts.

• Names of all groups are generic, can't protect name Maori, Apache more than English, or Thai, Chinese.

• Intellectual property is an idea that belongs to European culture, therefore it fails to meet the needs of indigenous culture since it is too stuck up to see indigenous communities eye to eye and come to an understanding

• People innovate around restrictions

• May encourage use of stereotypes instead because outside people created them

• Restricting culture helps it become lost 

• Use of intellectual property/privilege this encourages the move against cultural prostitution.

== Traditional cultural expressions ==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional cultural expressions can include designs and styles, which means that applying traditional Western-style international copyright laws{{snd}}which apply to a specific work, rather than a style{{snd}}can be problematic. Indigenous customary law often treats such concepts differently, and may apply restrictions upon the use of underlying styles and concepts.&lt;ref name=Engaging/&gt;

==Examples of Indigenous peoples claiming violation of their intellectual property==

===Intertribal Coalitions in North America===

Since the 1970s, Intertribal groups in North American have organized demonstrations against non-native use of Native American cultural elements; such as the sale of products and services allegedly derived from Indigenous knowledge:&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Helene E. [http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html "The Plastic Medicine People Circle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155048/http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html |date=5 March 2013 }} ''Sonoma Free County Press.'' Accessed 31 Jan 2013: "Shequish...came to the attention of Native American people two years ago as an impostor who pretended to have Shumash ancestry. I received a personal telephone call and a letter from the Chairman of a Shumash group south of Monterey. This phone call and a letter followed a Council meeting in which Shumash people took the decision to put a stop to Shequish Ohoho's activities in the Bay area as an 'Indian woman.' A group of real Indian women of San Francisco led a protest against Shequish and effectively terminated her money making seminars and ceremonies in this area. Her real name and background are known to California Indians who have denied her any tribal affiliation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"&gt;Sieg, Katrin, ''Ethnic Drag: Performing Race, Nation, Sexuality in West Germany'';  University of Michigan Press (20 August 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in ''Akwesasne Notes'', along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Peoples===

The 1993 Lakota Declaration of War (see above), urges people to identify instances where sacred traditions are being abused and to work toward stopping the abuse through demonstrations, boycotts, press coverage and direct intervention.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand]] turned their claim down in 2006, since ''Ka Mate'' had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the [[New Zealand government]] agreed to:
:"...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/livearticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 Ngāti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7882775.stm|title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight |date=11 February 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a survey of nineteenth-century New Zealand newspapers found Ka Mate was used by tribes from other parts of New Zealand, and was generally described by them as being an ancient peacekeeping song, from eras long before its appropriation by the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha. When Ngati Toa authorities were asked for evidence that Ka Mate was of Ngati Toa authorship, they were unable to provide any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksong.org.nz/ka_mate/ka_mate.pdf|title=Archer J.H.

==== Lego's Bionicle ====

In 2001 a dispute concerning the popular [[LEGO]] toy-line "[[Bionicle]]" arose between [[Denmark|Danish]] toymaker [[Lego Group]] and several Māori tribal groups (fronted by lawyer Maui Solomon) and members of the on-line discussion forum ([[Aotearoa Cafe]]). The Bionicle product line allegedly used many words [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] from Māori language, imagery and folklore. The dispute ended in an amicable settlement. Initially Lego refused to withdraw the product, saying it had drawn the names from many cultures, but later agreed that it had taken the names from Māori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy-line apart from the Māori legends. This did not prevent the many Bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words, resulting in the popular Bionicle website BZPower coming under a [[denial-of-service attack]] for four days from an attacker using the name Kotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/11/56451|title=Lego Site Irks Maori Sympathizer|last=Griggs|first=Kim|date=21 November 2002 |work=Wired|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopi and Apache Opt-Out From American Museums===

In 1994 certain Native American tribal organisations demanded that a number of museums remove certain materials from exhibition and access to the public. They cited the [[NAGPRA]] as the legal basis for their complaints.  Their position was that they would only permit such uses, selectively. after permission was requested directly to them.
Vernon Masayesva, CEO of the Hopi Tribe, and a consortium of Apache tribes demanded a number of American museums end public exhibition of and access to materials from their tribal cultures; including images, text, ceremonies, music, songs, stories, symbols, beliefs, customs, ideas, concepts and ethnographic field-notes, feature films, historical works, and any other medium in which their culture may appear literally, imagined, expressed, parodied or embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = Michael F. | authorlink =  | title = Can Culture Be Copyrighted? | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–222 | date = April 1998 | url = | jstor = 10.1086/204721 | doi=10.1086/204721}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 12 Dec 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Liberty Displaying the Arts and Sciences''''' (1792) is an [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by [[Visual arts of the United States|American artist]] [[Samuel Jennings (artist)|Samuel Jennings]].

The [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], a private [[lending library]] founded by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the mid-18th century, [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] Jennings (an ex-Philadelphian relocated to [[London]]) to create a work depicting "the [[Liberty (goddess)|figure of Liberty]] (with her cap and proper Insignia) displaying the arts" as a representation of [[slavery]] and a symbol of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement.

Jennings's painting shows a [[blond]], [[White people|white]] Goddess of Liberty (with a [[Phrygian cap|liberty cap]] on a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] or [[spear]]) presenting books (the catalog of the Library Company, and two others, labeled "[[philosophy]]" and "[[agriculture]]") to three grateful, supplicant blacks (freed slaves). Surrounding the four figures, in the foreground, are various symbols of [[knowledge]] and [[learning]]: a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]], a scroll (labeled "[[geometry]]"), papers and [[column]]s ([[architecture]]); a [[globe]] ([[geography]]), a [[lyre]] and [[sheet music]] ([[music]]), and a paper with [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] on it ([[history]] and [[heraldry]]). In the background, former slaves are dancing and celebrating around a [[liberty pole]]; behind them are ships on a [[body of water]].

The work is the earliest American painting extant celebrating [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2088">The '''Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios''' (LEAR; League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] association of revolutionary artists and writers. It was established in the house of its first president [[Leopoldo Méndez]] in 1933 from the disbanded "Sindicato de Trabajadores Técnicos, Pintores y Escultores" (''syndicate of technical workers, painters and sculptors''), and it was defined as the Mexican section of the [[International Union of Revolutionary Writers]], which was founded by the [[Comintern]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1930.

The first secretary of the organization was [[Luis Arenal]]. Other founding members were [[Juan de la Cabada]], [[Pablo O'Higgins]], [[Xavier Guerrero]], [[Ermilo Abreu Gómez]], [[Alfredo Zalce]], [[Fernando Gamboa (artist)|Fernando Gamboa]], [[Santos Balmori]], [[Clara Porset]], [[Ángel Bracho]], and many others.

Its members propagated revolutionary mindset in their writings and art works and were engaged against the national political development, especially against government art censorship as well against political violation of universal peace by war by [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] by the [[Spanish Civil War]] and other similar reasons. The ogan of the LEAR was the paper ''Frente a Frente'', which was illustrated by O'Higgins and others.

After the Mexican artists got more artistic license in their work by the liberal government of 1934, the Treuchtlingen dispersed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Espinosa Campos: [http://discursovisual.cenart.gob.mx/dvwebne08/documentos/doceduardo.htm ''Pablo O’Higgins - Cronología de su obra gráfica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718201532/http://discursovisual.cenart.gob.mx/dvwebne08/documentos/doceduardo.htm |date=2009-07-18 }} (Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain''', also known as '''''A Song to Nature''''', is a 1918 landmark public sculpture in bronze and granite by [[Victor David Brenner]]. It sits in [[Schenley Plaza]] at the entrance to [[Schenley Park]] and directly in front of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Frick Fine Arts Building]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  The fountain is designated as a contributing property to the [[Schenley Farms Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= University Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628170337/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3A%3Aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= |date=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of art comprises two major figures: a reclining [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the [[Greek god]] of shepherds, and above him a female singer playing a [[lyre]]. From crevices along the fountain's rim four turtles spew water into the basin. An inscription on the pedestal reads, "A Song of Nature, Pan the Earth God Answers to the Harmony and Magic Tones Sung to the Lyre by Sweet Humanity." The basin of the fountain is 15 feet high, above which the figures rise another 15 feet.

The fountain honors [[Mary Schenley]]. In 1889, after intensive lobbying by [[Edward Manning Bigelow]], director of parks for the City of Pittsburgh, Schenley donated the land for the park named in her honor. Upon her death, Pittsburgh City Council sponsored a national competition for the memorial. The judges selected this design by Brenner, who is famous today for his design of the [[Penny (United States coin)|Lincoln cent]], which is still in circulation.

In June 2008, restoration efforts were begun that include repairs, cleaning, plumbing, paving, and landscaping.  A gift from the Benter Foundation will provide lighting for the fountain and plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/search/s_580089.html | title=Repairs under way on Schenley fountain | publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2008-07-30 | accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''monochrom''' is an international [[art]]-[[technology]]-[[philosophy]] group, publishing house and film production company. monochrom was founded in 1993, and defines itself as "an unpeculiar mixture of proto-aesthetic fringe work, pop attitude, subcultural science and political activism".&lt;ref name="monochrom.at"&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/english/monochrom.htm monochrom self-definition on monochrom project page]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main office is located at [[Museumsquartier]]/[[Vienna]] (at 'QDK').

The group's members are: [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]], Evelyn Fürlinger, Harald Homolka-List, Anika Kronberger, Franz Ablinger, Frank Apunkt Schneider, Daniel Fabry, Günther Friesinger and Roland Gratzer.

The group is known for working with different media and entertainment formats, although many projects are performative and have a strong focus on a critical and educational narrative. Johannes Grenzfurthner calls this "looking for the best weapon of mass distribution of an idea".&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/narrativedesign-podcast/finding-your-weapons-of-mass-distribution-8a5241c3dc34#.osmbv9fe6 "Finding Your Weapons of Mass Distribution: A Conversation with Context Hacker Johannes Grenzfurthner", published on Narrative Design, September 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; monochrom is openly [[left-wing]] and tries to encourage [[civil society|public debate]], sometimes using [[subversive affirmation]] or ''over-affirmation'' as a tactic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/english/2004/05/new-monochrom-content-mobutobe-in-last.htm 2004 blog post about monochrom's project MOBUTOBE]&lt;/ref&gt; The group popularized the concept of "context hacking".&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/context-hacking-essay/|title=monochrom: Context Hacking - Essay|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of monochrom's 20th birthday in 2013, several Austrian high-profile media outlets&lt;ref&gt;[http://orf.at/stories/2163714/2163694/ orf.at: "Context-Hacking mit Eigenblunz’n", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1711701/ fm4.at: "Sei ein Scientist", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/profil-5_2013.jpg Profil: "20 Jahre monochrom: Zurück an den Nerd", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/falter--20jahremonochrom.png Falter: "Pubertät auf höchstem Niveau", issue 6/13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1358304927317/Blunzen-gegen-den-Boulevard Der Standard: "Blunzen gegen den Boulevard", January 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oe1.orf.at/programm/326748 Oe1 Leporello: "20 Jahre Künstlergruppe monochrom", January 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; paid tribute to the group's pioneering contributions within the field of contemporary art and discourse.

==History and philosophy==

In the early 1990s, Johannes Grenzfurthner was an active member of several [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] message boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner about Traceroute, Boing Boing magazine; April 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; He used his online connections to create a [[zine]] or alternative magazine that dealt with art, technology and subversive cultures, and was influenced by US magazines like ''[[Mondo 2000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurezone.at/digital-life/monochrom-das-hacken-treibt-uns-an/24.593.076 Futurezone: "Das Hacken treibt uns an", February 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
Grenzfurthner's motivation was to react to the [[The Californian Ideology|emerging conservativism]] in cyber-cultures of the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chaosradio.ccc.de/cre062.html CRE062 by Tim Pritlove: "Monochrom: Das etwas andere Künstlerkollektiv aus Wien", January 2, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and to combine his political background in the Austrian punk and [[Anti-fascism|antifa]] movement with discussion of new technologies and the cultures they create.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dkritik.de/interview/johannes-grenzfurthner/ Daumenkino: "Interview über Traceroute", February 11th, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"&gt;Marc Da Costa, "[http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom, Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210019/http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 |date=2012-03-17 }}", Furtherfield.&lt;/ref&gt; Franz Ablinger joined Grenzfurthner and they became the publication's core team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2014/38/50589.html Bernd Beier interviews Johannes Grenzfurthner in Jungle World: "Das Schockmoment ist nur noch Selbstmarketing", September 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first issue was released in 1993.

In 1995 the group decided to cover new artistic practices&lt;ref&gt;[http://rhysophocles.tumblr.com/post/3887941534/simulacrum-fisticuffs Simulacrum Fisticuffs (interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner), Rhysophocles, March 16, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063925/http://rhysophocles.tumblr.com/post/3887941534/simulacrum-fisticuffs |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erin Kobayashi, "[https://www.thestar.com/article/178430--how-to-be-buried-alive How to be buried alive]", ''Toronto Star'', February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lechner, "[http://www.ecrans.fr/Pop-Guerilla,3513.html]", Libération, March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and started experimenting with different media: performances, computer games, robots, puppet theater, musical, short films, pranks, conferences, online activism.

[[File:Monochrom--Johannes Grenzfurthner-and-Franz Ablinger---Pension-MIDI.jpg|thumb|monochrom's Johannes Grenzfurthner and Franz Ablinger (at monochrom's "Pension MIDI", Klangturm St. Pölten, 2001)]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1995 we decided that we didn't want to constrain ourselves to just one media format (the "fanzine"). We knew that we wanted to create statements, create viral information. So a quest for the best "Weapon of Mass Distribution" started, a search for the best transportation mode for a certain politics of philosophical ideas. This was the [[Cambrian Explosion]] of monochrom. We wanted to experiment, try stuff, find new forms of telling our stories. But, to be clear, it was (and still is) not about keeping the pace, of staying up-to-date, or (even worse) staying "fresh". The emergence of new media (and therefore artistic) formats is certainly interesting. But etching information into copper plates is just as exciting. We think that the perpetual return of 'the new', to cite [[Walter Benjamin]], is nothing to write home about - except perhaps for the slave-drivers in the fashion industry. We've never been interested in the new just in itself, but in the accidental occurrence. In the moment where things don't tally, where productive confusion arises.&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the other core team members joined between 1995 and 2006.

Grenzfurthner is the group's artistic director. He defines monochrom's artistic and activist approach as 'Context hacking'&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 ''Context Hacking: Some Examples of How to Mess with Art, the Media System, Law and the Market'', at O'Reilly ETech 2008, San Diego] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314093838/http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Urban Hacking'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercinema.com/otherzine/?issueid=26&amp;article_id=145 ''Urban Hacking: Culture Jamming in the Risky Spaces of Modernity'', book review by Molly Hankwitz in OtherCinema, September 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The group monochrom refers to its working method as »Context Hacking,« thus referencing the hacker culture, which propagates a creative and emancipatory approach to the technologies of the digital age, and in this way turns against the continuation into the digital age of a centuries-old technological enslavement perpetrated through knowledge and hierarchies of experts. [...] Context hacking transfers the hackers' objectives and methods to the network of social relationships in which artistic production occurs, and upon which it is dependent. [...] One of context hackers' central ambitions is to bring the factions of counterculture, which have veered off along widely diverging trajectories, back together again.&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Community and network==
[[File:Monochrom-Flyer-1996.png|thumb|Flyer for monochrom's publication and community activity, 1996. Drawing by Gerhard Junker, flyer design by Michael Marrak.]]
From its very foundation, the group defined itself as a ''movement'', ''culture''&lt;ref name="furtherfield.org"/&gt; (referring to [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[The Culture|sci-fi series]]) and "open field of experimentation".&lt;ref name="monochrom.at"/&gt; monochrom supported and supports various artists, activists, researchers and communities with an online publishing platform, a print publishing service (''edition mono''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/ edition mono, monochrom's publishing house, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; and organizes in-person meetings, screenings, radio shows, debate circles, conferences, online platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/liveobstruktae/performance.htm Exhaustive list of all of monochrom's performances, meetings and gatherings since 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; It is fundamental for the group's core members to combine artistic and educational endeavors with community work&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1711699/ FM4, Thomas Edlinger: "Besser als besser werden", January 27, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[social practice (art)|social practice]]).

Some collaborations have been rather short-lived (for example the publication of a 1993 [[fringe science]] paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/segal/ Prof. Dr. Jakob Segal: "Der Ursprung des AIDS", edition mono online, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jakob Segal]], projects with the [[Billboard Liberation Front]] and [[Ubermorgen]] or the administration of [[Dorkbot]] Vienna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/|title=monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), some have been going for many years and decades (for example with [[Michael Marrak]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Jon Lebkowsky]], [[Fritz Ostermayer]], [[V. Vale]], [[eSeL]], [[Scott Beale (cultural curator)|Scott Beale]]/[[Laughing Squid]], [[Eric Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]], [[Jason Scott]], Michael Zeltner, Anouk Wipprecht, VSL Lindabrunn).

monochrom is running the DIY project "Hackbus" in cooperation with David "Daddy D" Dempsey (of [[FM4]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laughingsquid.com/hackbus-a-community-wiki-for-mobile-hack-vehicles/|title=Hackbus, A Community Wiki For Mobile Hack Vehicles|date=17 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supports initiatives like the ''Radius Festival'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160426104353/http://www.radiusfestival.com/vienna/ Radius Festival Vienna, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Play:Vienna'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://playvienna.com/ Play:Vienna, project page]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Buckminster Fuller]] Institute Austria'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/index.php?id=11&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_sbportfolio_pi1%5Buid%5D=7&amp;cHash=c8c4d36304b6cabf051f71c8fc864015 edition mono and Buckminster Fuller Institute Austria: "How To Make The World Work", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[RE/Search]]'', the ''Semantic Web Company''&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition-mono.at/fileadmin/template/images/DownloadPDF/LOD-TheEssentials.pdf "Linked Open Data: The Essentials", edition mono/monochrom, Bauer, F., &amp; Kaltenböck, M. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Vienna hackerspace ''[[Metalab]]''.

[[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] sees monochrom as a community and social incubator of critical and subversive thinkers.&lt;ref name="context-hacking-essay" /&gt; An example is [[Bre Pettis]] of [[MakerBot Industries]], who got inspired to create 3d printers during his art residency with monochrom in 2007. Pettis wanted to create a robot that could print shot glasses for monochrom's cocktail-robot event [[Roboexotica]] and did research about the [[RepRap]] project at [[Metalab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/article/made-in-my-backyard-bre-pettis/|title=Made in my Backyard / Bre Petits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot glasses remained a theme throughout the history of MakerBot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/08/tech/innovation/makerbot-pettis-sxsw/|title=Startup unveils 3-D scanner at SXSW|author=Brandon Griggs, CNN|date=9 March 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

monochrom offers a collaborative art residency in Vienna. Since 2003 the group has invited and created projects with artists, researchers and activists like [[Suhrkamp]]'s Johannes Ullmaier, pop theorist Stefan Tiron, performance artist Angela Dorrer, DIY blogger [[Bre Pettis]], photographer and activist Audrey Penven, digital artist Eddie Codel, sex work activist Maggie Mayhem, glitch artist Phil Stearns, illustrator Josh Ellingson, DIY artist Ryan Finnigan, digital artist Jane Tingley, digital rights activist [[Jacob Appelbaum]], sex tech expert Kyle Machulis, hacker Nick Farr, filmmakers [[Sophia Cacciola]] and [[Michael J. Epstein]], and others.&lt;br&gt;All former resident artists are considered ''ambassadors''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/english/monochrom.htm|title=monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, monochrom is the European correspondent for [[Boing Boing]] Video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/monochrom-bye-bye-a.html|title=Monochrom: Bye Bye (a short film) - Boing Boing Video|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622094216/http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/15/monochrom-bye-bye-a.html|archivedate=22 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main projects==
* ''Schubumkehr'' (1995–1996)
** A manifesto propagating 'internet demarketing' and deals with negative aspects of early net culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digest.textfiles.com/uploads/mcomschubumkehr-1996.txt Schubumkehr Manifesto archived at textfiles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mackerel Fiddlers'' (1996-)
** A radical anti-representation/anti-recording music movement that partially refers to [[Hakim Bey]]'s [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]. To quote the manifesto: "We set value on developing a form of viral resistance by systematic infiltration of symphonic orchestras. A New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1984) could have been transformed by at least one Mackerel Fiddler and Austria's image would have been ruined worldwide. [...] These days, self-production and 'embarrassment sells' have become the golden rules of media, be it radio, TV, or telegraph. Thus it is not only legitimate to be ashamed of ones activity as a Mackerel Fiddler, it is also thankworthy. Failure is beautiful! Disgrace is sunshine!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/makrelengeiger/index-eng.htm|title=Makrelengeiger (Mackerel Fiddlers)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monochrom--Der Exot--1997.jpg|thumb|Rare photograph of "Der Exot", monochrom's tele-controlled robot project (1997).]]
* ''Der Exot'' (1997–2012)
** A tele-robot remotely controlled via a web-interface/chat forum. The robot was supported and operated by a big community. The robot's basic structure was built out of remodeled [[Lego]] bricks and equipped with a [[Fisheye lens]] camera. The project was the first tele-robot/tele-community projects of its kind. It was presented at art festivals and technology presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/derexot/|title=der exot|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://secureweb.sil.at/01/v004544/art/1998_jungeszene_e.html Secession, exhibition "Junge Szene 1998"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819193100/https://secureweb.sil.at/01/v004544/art/1998_jungeszene_e.html |date=2016-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://robot.t0.or.at/exhib/exot.htm Public Netbase t0, exhibition "ROBOTRONIKA - hypermatic:automagic', June 19-23, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
** monochrom relaunched the project in 2011, calling it a "resurrection", and specifying the social aspect of the project: "A mobile robot with a mounted camera that can be controlled via web interface. But that's tricky. If too many people try to control the robot at the same time it is counter-productive. [...] Der Exot is the anti-crowd source robot. The users have to discuss and cooperate via a chat interface to communicate where they want to go, what corners they want to explore, what to crush." The project was presented at the 'Robotville' Exhibition of the Science Museum London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/press_and_media/press_releases/2011/11/Copy%20of%20From%20giant%20iPhone%20towers%20to%20live%20newsfeeds%20in%20a%20knot.aspx|title=Oops...|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704094148/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/press_and_media/press_releases/2011/11/Copy%20of%20From%20giant%20iPhone%20towers%20to%20live%20newsfeeds%20in%20a%20knot.aspx|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://makezine.com/2011/12/12/monochroms-der-exot-is-an-experiment-in-crowd-control/ Make Zine: "Monochrom's Der Exot Is an Experiment in Crowd Control", December 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Soul Sale'' (1998)
** A "spirituo-capitalist" booth where project members tried to buy the [[soul]]s of passers-by for $5 per soul. A total of fifteen were purchased and registered. These souls are still being offered for sale to third parties with power of disposal. The group sees the project - beyond all philosophical discourses and argumentation seeking to prove the existence of god - in the classical sense of a market driven by supply and demand. The soul is a tradeable commodity, a form of virtual capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/seele/|title=we buy souls / wir kaufen seelen|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Soviet Unterzoegersdorf]]'' (1999-)
** The fake history of the "last existing appanage republic of the [[USSR]]", Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. Created to discuss topics such as the theoretical problems of [[historiography]], the concept of the "[[socialist]] [[utopia]]" and the political struggles of [[postwar]] Europe. The theoretical concept was transformed into an [[improvisational theatre]]/[[performance]]/[[LARP]] that lasted two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strudelinisnackbar.splinder.com/post/5932663|title=strudelinisnackbar - Articoli e post su strudelinisnackbar trovati nei migliori blog|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004232255/http://strudelinisnackbar.splinder.com/post/5932663|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2005 monochrom presented the first part of a computer game trilogy: "Soviet Unterzoegersdorf - The Adventure Game" (using [[Adventure Game Studio|AGS]]). To monochrom it was clear that the [[adventure game]], an almost extinct form of computer game, would provide the perfect media platform to communicate the idea of "Soviet Unterzoegersdorf". [[Edge (games magazine)]] chose the game as their 'internet game of the month' of November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.sil.at/suzoeg_edge112005.jpg The Edge, Internet Game of the Monath, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=5265|title=Home of the Underdogs|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neural.it/nnews/sovietunterzogersdorf.htm Review of 'Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector 1' in: 'Neural', 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531061540/http://www.neural.it/nnews/sovietunterzogersdorf.htm |date=2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In March 2009 monochrom presented 'Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II'. The game features special guest appearances of [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Jello Biafra]], [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], [[Bre Pettis]] and [[MC Frontalot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=408|title=Homepage - www.furtherfield.org|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027183632/http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=408|archivedate=27 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2011 monochrom and Austrian production company Golden Girls Filmproduktion announced that they are working on the feature film Sierra Zulu. The movie will be dealing with Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. In 2012 monochrom presented the 16-minute short film "Earthmoving". It is a prequel to the feature film Sierra Zulu and features actors Jeff Ricketts, Martin Auer, Lynsey Thurgar, Adrienne Ferguson and Alexander Fennon.
* ''Scrotum gegen votum'' (''Scrotum for a vote'') (2000-)
** "A form of political commentary for "about fifty percent of the population". Masculine individuals (whether in [[sex]] or [[gender]]) are seated nude in a special chair attached to a flatbed scanner. The scans then may or may not be sent to various politicians. The project won the NEBAPOMIC 2000 (Network-based Political Minimalism Counteraction Award) in the category of small country with political tendencies towards the conservative right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futur.plomlompom.de/archiv/1334/|title=futur:plom: 23c3 #23: monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Minus 24x'' (2001)
** monochrom's pro-[[failure]]/pro-[[error]]/pro-inability [[manifesto]], hailing the "[[Luddites]] of inability". Quote: "Turning an object against the use inscribed in it (as sociolect of the world of things) means probing its possibilities. [...] The information age is an age of permanently getting stuck. Greater and greater speed is demanded. New software, new hardware, new structures, new cultural techniques. Lifelong learning? Yes. But the company can't fire the secretary every six months, just because she can't cope with the new version of Excel. They can count their keystrokes, measure their productivity ... but! They will never be able to sanction their inability! Because that is immanent." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfiles.com/uploads/mchrom-minus24x.txt Manifesto archived on textfiles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ESeL.at monochrom thomann grave 2005.jpg|thumb|Georg Paul Thomann's grave in Hall in Tirol, Austria (created by monochrom in 2005).]]
* ''[[Georg Paul Thomann]]'' (2002–2005)
** monochrom was chosen to represent the Republic of Austria at the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], [[São Paulo]] ([[Brazil]]) in 2002.  However, the political climate in Austria (at that time, the center-right [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] had recently formed a coalition with [[Jörg Haider]]'s radical-right [[Austrian Freedom Party]]) gave the left-wing art group concerns about acting as wholehearted representatives of their nation. monochrom dealt with the conundrum by creating the persona of Georg P. Thomann, an irascible, controversial (and completely fictitious) artist of longstanding fame and renown. Through the implementation of this ironic mechanism - even the catalogue included the biography of the non-existent artist - the group solved with pure fiction the philosophical and bureaucratic dilemma attached to the system of representation presented to them by the Biennial.
** An interesting story related to the Thomann project took place once the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] was underway. The artist [[Chien-Chi Chang]] was invited as the representative of [[Taiwan]], but the country's name was removed by the administration from his cube over night and replaced by the label, "Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei." As the members of monochrom discovered, China had threatened to retreat from the Biennial (and create massive diplomatic problems) if the organizers of the Biennial were thought to be challenging the "[[One-China policy]]." Chang's open letter remained unanswered. Under the guise of Thomann, monochrom invited artists from several countries to show their solidarity with Chang by taking the adhesive letters from their countries' name tags and giving them to Chang so that he could remount "Taiwan" outside his room. monochrom wanted to show that artists do not necessarily have to internalize the fragmentation and isolation imposed by the rat-race of art markets and exhibitions as society-controlling imperatives. Several Asian newspapers reported about the performance. One Taiwanese newspaper headlined: "Austrian artist Georg Paul Thomann saves 'Taiwan'".&lt;ref name="TEDx Talks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Rvh8VG3o8|title=TEDxVienna-Johannes Grenzfurthner-On how to subvert subversion|first=|last=TEDx Talks|date=21 December 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcomercio.com.br/materia.aspx?id=64151&amp;canal=50 "A Bienal que não foi vista" in Diario do Comercio, 10/3/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2005 monochrom released a press info that "Austrian artist and writer Prof. Georg Paul Thomann died in a tragic accident at the tender age of 60". On 29 July 2005 they staged his funeral in [[Hall in Tirol]]. Thomann's gravesite remains in Hall. Georg Paul Thomann's tombstone shows an engraved [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the Thomann project page.
** Georg Paul Thomann is featured in [[RE/Search]]'s "Pranks 2" book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prank2exc16.php RE/Search Interview with monochrom about aspects of the Thomann project, printed in "Pranks 2"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206122116/http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prank2exc16.php |date=2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cocktail robot at Roboexotica 2007 in Vienna, Austria.jpg|thumb|Cocktail robot at Roboexotica 2007 in Vienna, Austria]]
* ''[[Roboexotica]]'' (2002-)
** An annual festival where scientists, researchers, computer geeks and artists from all over the world  build [[cocktail]] [[robot]]s and discuss technological [[innovation]], [[futurology]] and [[science fiction]]. ''Roboexotica'' is also an ironic attempt to criticize techno-[[triumphalism]] and to dissect technological [[Media circus|hype]]s. 2002 monochrom teamed up with Shifz in the organization of the events.

* ''The Absent Quintessence'' (2002)
** Feature films were drastically cut and thereby wrenched out of their genres (hardcore [[porn]], [[splatter film|splatter]], eastern/kung fu, [[zombie]] etc.). These genre films — all of which are characterized by a certain anonymity and a mass-produced look — have been stripped of their "essential" scenes (for example, all sex scenes in the pornography, all fight scenes in the kung fu films). Thus, the material has been reduced to a bare-bones plot that had actually been conceived only as filler, but its aesthetics and stereotypical narrative patterns now make it easy to contextualize. The project tried to analyze these "re-released" shorts and to filter out interesting subtexts.
* ''Towers of Hanoi'' (2002)
** Members of the group entered a bank and exchanged 50 euros to dollars, then back again to euros - and so on - until the money was gone. Afterwards the group calculated how many times you have to exchange the global amount of cash (20 trillion euros) from euros to dollars until it vanishes completely. It was calculated that if this process was completed a total of 849 times using the global amount of cash, 18 cents would remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/tuerme-von-hanoi/|title=tuerme von hanoi|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Together with Patick Hoenninger. Milk packages collected in many countries. The standardized format of the [[Tetra Pak]] offers a worldwide frame for creative variation, which becomes visible on the 9.5 by 16.5&amp;nbsp;cm front of the packaging. According to the group, the relation to pop art not only exists in an aesthetic but also in a social dimension, reminiscent of [[Walter Benjamin]]'s "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility.]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/tetrapak/en-index.html Online gallery of ''452 x 157&amp;nbsp;cm^2 global durability'']&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Viennese Factionism: Eigenblunzn'' (2003)
** Members of the group prepared [[blood sausage]] out of their own blood and ate it ('auto blood sausage'). The performance was accompanied by political essays about the 'autocannibalistic' tendencies of the global economy.

** A [[musical theater|musical]] about [[Udo Proksch]], a criminal figure in recent Austrian history. Born to  a poor family he rose to become the darling of Austrian high society before landing in jail on a life sentence for sinking a ship and its crew in order to cash in on insurance of nonexistent goods.

** In 2010 monochrom created the "Six Feet Under Club". Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground to perform sexual acts. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is "extremely private and intimate". The coffin "is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding 'till death do us part'." However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. monochrom's performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy. "Six Feet Under Club" performances took place in San Francisco in 2010 and Vienna in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/6fuc/RueMorgue--January2011-Page34_SixFeetUnderClub.pdf 'Dirty Deeds Done Six Feet Deep', in Rue Morgue, January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths "Six Feet Under Club takes Sex To New Depths", in 'Carnal Nation', 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213234425/http://carnalnation.com/content/58648/957/six-feet-under-club-takes-sex-new-depths |date=2010-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php sfist.com: "Want to Be Buried Alive With Your S.O. and Make Out With Them While Others Watch Via Webcam?", 2 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602083002/http://sfist.com/2010/10/02/want_to_be_buried_alive_with_your_s.php |date=2 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/sex-love/article/20740921/the-six-feet-under-club-offers-sex-in-a-buried-coffin#.UfjcaG0deSo Daily Loaf, CL Tampa Bay: "The Six Feet Under Club offers sex in a buried coffin", 28 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/10/07/couples-have-sex-in-coffin-buried-in-dumpster-video SF Weekly: "Couples Have Sex In Coffin Buried In Dumpster ", 7 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/heute-sarg-3.jpg Heute: "Sex im Sarg: Alle sind schon sehr erregt", 29 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/six-feet-club-art-project-burying-kinky-couples-alive/ Huck Magazine: "The Six Feet Under Club: an art project burying kinky couples alive", 31 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '' Brick Of Coke '' (2005)
** monochrom created a 'Brick Of Coke': they put twenty gallons of [[Coca-Cola]] into a pot and boiled it down for a week until the residue left behind could be molded into a brick. The performance and talk dealt with the sugar industry and other multinational corporation policies and Coca-Cola as a symbol of corporate power.

* ''Growing Money'' (2005)
** To quote monochrom's press statement: "Money is frozen desire. Thus it governs the world. Money is used for all forms of trade, from daily shopping at the supermarket to trafficking in human beings and drugs. In the course of all these transactions, our money wears out quickly, especially the smaller bank notes that are changing hands constantly. [...] Money is dirty, and thus it is a living entity. This is something we take literally: money is an ideal environment for microscopic organisms and bacteria. We want to make your money grow. In a potent [[nutrient]] fluid under heat lamps we want to get as much life as we can out of your [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]s."

* ''Magnetism Party'' (2005)
** In form of a staged [[college]] [[party]] monochrom deleted all the electromagnetic storage media that they could find with a couple of heavy-duty [[neodymium]] [[magnet]]s. monochrom stated that the Magnetism Party was an attempt to actively come to terms with one aspect of the information society that is almost completely ignored by our [[epistemological]] machinery: forgetting. The slogan was "Delete is just another word for nothing left to lose". ("Magnetism Party" was part of the "Experience The Experience" tour.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/festplatten-mangel-nix-zu-loeschen-auf-daten-loeschparty-a-361329.html|title=Festplatten-Mangel: Nix zu Löschen auf Daten-Löschparty|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Catapulting Wireless Devices'' (2005)
** The [[catapult]] is one of the oldest machines in the history of technology. monochrom created an ironic statement about progress. The group build a small [[medieval]] [[trebuchet]] and used a couple of issues of techno-utopist magazine [[Wired magazine|Wired]] as a counterweight to catapult wireless devices (e.g. [[cell phone]]s or [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s) at the greatest possible distance. ("Catapulting Wireless Devices" was part of the "Experience The Experience" tour.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/15/in_san_francisco_tom.html 'Catapulting Wireless Devices', in Boing Boing, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806082736/http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/15/in_san_francisco_tom.html |date=2006-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monochrom's "ARAD II".jpg|thumb|Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom acting as a CDC official at a staged virus outbreak at Art Basel Miami Beach 2005.]]
* ''Arad-II'' (2005):
** The members of monochrom staged a fake (public theatre performance) about a deadly virus outbreak at 'Art Basel [[Miami Beach]]', one of the biggest art fairs in North America. monochrom dealt with the networking/business aspect of the art market, the post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks]] hysteria about biological warfare and the media coverage about [[Avian influenza]] (bird flu). Press release quote: "In mid-November 2005, Günther Friesinger visited the Ulaangom Biennial in the Republic of Mongolia. [...] He directly departed to Miami to attend some meetings at Art Basel Miami Beach. [...] There is acute evidence that he is carrying a rare, but highly contaigent sub-form of the Arad-II Virus (family Onoviridae), of which Freiburg virus is also a member. [...] Friesinger is walking around the different art fairs in Miami Beach and is spreading the pathogen. The situation is critical. A worldwide outbreak – due to the many visitors from all over the world – is imminent. [...] We want to find all the people that Günther Friesinger smalltalked to and handshaked with. We want to retrieve and destroy the business cards he has spread. Additionally we must take him into custody and in the event of his death cremation is absolutely necessary."&lt;ref name="Arad-II Crisis / monochrom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/arad-ii/|title=Arad-II Crisis / monochrom|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Waiting for GOTO'' (2006):
** The reference point monochrom chose for their theatre-project 'Waiting for GOTO' ([[Volkstheater Wien]]) is the theatre classic '[[Waiting for Godot]]' which is projected into the future by modernistic references to science-fiction. In 'Waiting for Goto' we meet 'ideological delinquents' in a distant interstellar future who are separated from their bodies and locked up in two female students who are able to earn their college fees and make ends meet thanks to this job. The play presents us with monochrom's portrayal of everyday work in a neo-liberal society, double consciousness, the endurance of incorporated contradictions by fragmented subjects, and the exploitation of the living body, self-alienation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/news/92949/Kritik-Theater_Die-Ausserirdischen-in-Dir-wollen-nur-Deinen-Koerper?from=suche.intern.portal|title=Kritik Theater: Die Außerirdischen in Dir wollen nur Deinen Körper!|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Café King Soccer (Café König Fußball)'' (2006)
** In June 2006, monochrom created the art installation 'Café King Soccer' at NGBK Gallery in Berlin. The installation deals with the soccer corruption case in whose centre we find referee [[Robert Hoyzer]]. monochrom reflect on the fact that soccer has at all times mirrored the [[dialectics]] between the culture of [[subjectivity]] of the [[working class]] and the assertion of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of [[middle-class]] culture. The former is represented by the collectives that meet in the game, the latter by the referee, an exemplary civil subject conducting the game by acting as its objective opponent. The Hoyzer case violated this agreement. In it, Hoyzer is – especially in the forefront of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany – also a tragic character, because he acted out his inner self-contradiction as an exemplary civil subject in a publicly effective way. At the same time, the Hoyzer case is itself an integral part of the game – merely because of his exemplary immolation as a scapegoat which seems to correspond exactly to his role on the field - and conditio sine qua non of its perpetuation.
* ''Campaign For The Abolition Of Personal Pronouns'' (2006):
** monochrom propagates the creation of gender-neutral personal pronouns. In an activist way the group states that there is a relationship between the structure of language and the way people think and act (see [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]]).
[[File:Monochrom_lord-jim-lodge_coca-cola-light-art-award.jpg|thumb|Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom. Winner of Coke Light Art Edition 2006. A limited edition of 50,000 Lord bottles was presented on September 22, 2006.]]
* ''Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom'' (2006-):
**The Lord Jim Lodge was founded during the 1980s by the artists Jörg Schlick, [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Albert Oehlen]] and [[Wolfgang Bauer (artist)|Wolfgang Bauer]]. Every member was obliged to use the lodge logo and/or the "Sun Breasts Hammer" symbol and the slogan "No one helps nobody" in his work. The group's declared goal was to make the logo "more well known than that of Coca-Cola". Thanks to the international recognition received by the oeuvres of Kippenberger, Oehlen and Schlick the Lord Jim Lodge has already attained a relatively high degree of notoriety. Still, the logo's dissemination has remained – despite the international reputation that these artists have achieved – within the framework of the art system and its peripheral importance. As an intentional addition to works of visual art it was in the end limited by their material form of existence. In March 2006 it was announced that monochrom has assumed ownership of all trademark and usage rights of the artist Jörg Schlick's Lord Jim Lodge. monochrom took part in a contest by '[[Coca-Cola]] Light' ('Coca-Cola Light Art Edition 2006'). Quote monochrom: "This puts us in a position to set in motion long overdue synergy effects between Coca-Cola and the Lord Jim Lodge. The only possibility for realizing the challenge formulated in the lodge logo is to use a habitat in the merchandise world as a vehicle of transmission for guiding the message through that world's channels of distribution and into public consciousness. [...] Thus we would like to use the prize as a trial run for such a form of cooperation/competition. Coca-Cola and Lord Jim Lodge – together at last! The symbolic-economic capital of the Lord Jim Lodge and the economic-symbolic capital of Coca-Cola will be brought together, paving the way for a better future. For a world of radical beauty and exclusive bottles in small editions! In the end we are all individuals – at least as long as nobody comes along and proves the contrary." monochrom won the prize. The logo of "Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom" was printed to 50.000 Coca-Cola Light bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turia.at/titel/kroeger.html|title=Kroeger u.a.

*''Der Streichelnazi / Nazi Petting Zoo'' (2008):
** The group staged a public "[[Nazi]] petting" or "hugging" on a heavily frequented Viennese shopping street. The piece is a political and ironic statement about Austria's Nazi past and how Austria deals with it. Quote from their video documentation: "In 1938 Austria joined the Third Reich. Millions cheered Hitler and in the referendum 99.75% said 'yes' to 'Greater Germany'. But after World War II, many Austrians sought comfort in the idea of Austria as "the Nazis' first victim". Factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that it was only annexation at the point of a bayonet(te). But it's time to embrace history. It's time to remember the feel-good days of 1938. It's time to let our real feelings out! It's time to hug the Nazi, Austria! Finally!"&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A video is available within the monochrom site [http://www.monochrom.at/streichelnazi/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2008/07/02/bbtv-monochrom-nazi.html|title=BBtv: Monochrom's Nazi Petting Zoo|date=1 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monochrom--Kiki and Bubu- Rated R Us.jpg|thumb|monochrom's "Kiki and Bubu: Rated R US" (2012)]]
*''Kiki and Bubu'' (2008-):
** Invited by [[Boing Boing]]'s [[Xeni Jardin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/06/monochrom-economic-r.html Boing Boing: "Monochrom: Economic Recession Wisdom from Sock Puppets", August 6, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803082202/http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/08/06/monochrom-economic-r.html |date=August 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; monochrom created a [[sock puppet]] show focussing on the characters of Kiki and Bubu, an orange-red bird and a brown bear. Kiki is the well-read one, while Bubu is portrayed as a little slow, but often surprises with deep insights. Kiki and Bubu are fond of the ideology of [[Neo-Marxism]] and the series is based on the idea of explaining leftist terms (like [[commodification]], [[neoliberalism]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], [[planned economy]]) in an entertaining yet surreal way.
** The first installments were short films (2008), but monochrom also created life puppet shows&lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/foo-camp-2008-photos/ Laughing Squid: "Foo Camp 2008 photos"]&lt;/ref&gt; (2008, 2010, 2014) and a 50-minute feature video called ''Kiki and Bubu: Rated R Us'' (2012): "Kiki and Bubu have some feelings, so they sign up for an online dating site. When the People of China want to become their friend, they are excited. However, sending the People of China a video of themselves proves to be difficult: Their content gets flagged as inappropriate and taken down from YouTube. On the long quest for knowledge which follows, Kiki and Bubu learn all about Internet censorship. And love."&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2012/11/25/kiki-and-bubu-neo-marxist-soc.html Boing Boing: "Kiki and Bubu: neo-Marxist sock puppets join dating service, get friended by China, get taken down from YouTube", November 25, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing the historical context of hackerspaces originally expanding from the counter culture movement and conceived as niches against bourgeois society, Grenzfurthner and Schneider argue that hackerspaces today function quite differently as they initially did. Back in the seventies, these open spaces were imagined as tiny worlds to escape from capitalism or authoritarian regimes. The idea was much more based on micro-political tactics than on hippie's spirit: Instead of trying to transfer the old world into a new one people started to build up tiny new worlds with the old world. They made up open space were people could come together and try out different forms of living, working, maybe loving and whatever people do when they want to do something. In a capitalist society, alternative concepts always end up to be commodified such as "indie music" becomes mainstream. According to Grenzfurthner and Schneider, the same happened to hackerspaces when "the political approach faded away on ''en route'' into tiny geeky workshop paradises".

The '''Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum''' (MHOF) honors all musicians regardless of genre or instrument. The MHOF timeline starts with the beginning of recorded music and inductees are nominated by current members of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] and by other music industry professionals.

== First museum ==

The museum first opened June 6, 2006 at 301 6th Ave. S., [[Nashville, Tennessee]] Exhibits consisted of instruments owned and played by well-known artists as well as behind-the-scenes session musicians.  These musicians were often the house studio musicians in cities such as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Detroit]], [[Nashville]], [[Muscle Shoals]] and [[New York City]].  These musicians were often the unsung heroes behind the hits of many great artists. These relatively small groups of players often recorded the majority of hits in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  The museum was voted venue of the year by the [[Meeting Professionals International]] in 2008.

== Inductees ==

== Closing and reopening ==

In February 2010, under the rules of [[eminent domain]], the city of Nashville purchased the MHOF property in order to make room for the [[Music City Center]] (new convention center). On August 29, 2013 the MHOF reopened on the first floor of the historic [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]] just off the James Robertson Parkway exit at 401 Gay Street, Nashville, TN 37219.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2013/08/27/musicians-hall-of-fame-reopens-in-nashville-after-three-year-absence/&lt;/ref&gt; The 200,000 square foot building houses the historic 10,000 seat Municipal Auditorium. The 68,000 sq. ft. exhibit floor, which was also Nashville's first convention center, will now house the museums artifacts and museum.&lt;ref name=np/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsmv/&gt;

'''NVA''' is an arts organisation and charity based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. It was founded in 1992 by [[Angus Farquhar]], a former member of the group [[Test Dept]]. The company's name is an acronym of ''nacionale vitae activa'', a Latin term meaning 'the right to influence public affairs'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/about/ About NVA.] Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is best known for its dramatic, large-scale environmental artworks in Scottish natural landscapes, building on the site-specific performances that Farquhar created with Test Dept. These works have included ''The Secret Sign'', ''The Path'', ''The Storr'' and ''Half Life''. The works are designed to involve local communities and to incorporate regeneration aspects that will benefit the landscapes in the future. For example, improvements were made to the footpaths around The Storr as part of the preparation for that work.

== ''The Secret Sign'' ==

''The Secret Sign'' took place at night on 9–16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near [[Loch Lomond]]. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows blacked out) to the site of the work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots. They were then escorted through the glen by members of the company. Various artistic interventions were visible along the way, including lights, sounds, birds of prey and live performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+secret+sign/ ''The Secret Sign''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Path'' ==

''The Path'' was a two-hour night-time walk that took place from 19 May – 4 June 2000 at Glen Lyon in Perthshire. Like ''The Secret Sign'' it featured light, sound, performance and music, including Buddhist chant by Ani Choying Drolma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+path/ ''The Path''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Storr'' ==

''The Storr'' took place at night from 1 August – 17 September 2005 at [[The Storr]], a rocky hill in [[Trotternish]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]. Audience members were bussed to the site from bases in [[Portree]] and [[Staffin]] and kitted out with head torches and walking sticks. They were then led up to the base of the Old Man of Storr, a natural rock formation. Like the earlier works, the walk was marked by lights, sounds, music and performance. The work contained music by [[Geir Jenssen]] and [[Paul Mounsey]], live performance by [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] singer Ann Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet [[Sorley MacLean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+storr+unfolding+landscape/ ''The Storr''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of ''The Storr'' included a series of [[LED]] stars which together made up the largest light sculpture ever seen in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1532752,00.html Call of the wild]". ''The Guardian'' 21 July 2005. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of mounting the work was £1 million.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

== ''Half Life'' ==

''Half Life'' took place at [[Kilmartin Glen]], [[Argyll]] from 4–16 September 2007, and was a collaboration between NVA and the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. It consisted of two parts: a daytime element, where visitors could explore a series of sites and installations based around known and rarely seen prehistoric landmarks; and a night-time element, consisting of an outdoor production staged in a forest location at the entrance to the glen, centred on a sculptural set constructed from felled logs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/half+life/ ''Half Life''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''White Bike Plan'' ==

In April 2010 NVA re-enacted Witte Fietsenplan (White Bike Plan), a free transport programme by the Provos, the Dutch counter culture movement of the 1960s. NVA released 50 white bicycles across the city, which were available for the audience of Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art to travel between venues for the duration of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/witte+feitsenplan+white+bike+plan-24/ ''White Bike Plan''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Glasgow Harvest'' ==

NVA hosted the first Glasgow Harvest in August 2010 at the Hidden Gardens. Glasgow Harvest was a celebration of urban farming, and encouraged visitors to participate in a mass open-air meal prepared using their home-grown ingredients.
Visitors were invited to contribute to an immense jam wall, sample edible punk haircuts, and submit to competition the creative containers they had used to grow plants. Glasgow's allotments made 12 different soups and 20 local schools participated in the Double Rubble Chip Challenge - making chips at Harvest from potatoes they had grown from seed in their playgrounds.

== ''Speed of Light'' ==
Speed of Light was a major [[Edinburgh International Festival]] 2012 commission, one of Scotland's signature contributions to the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad|Olympic cultural programme]]. Conceived and produced by NVA, the transformation of [[Arthur's Seat]], [[Edinburgh]]'s iconic mountain, combined innovative public art and sport. Using energy-harvesting technologies to illuminate walkers and specially designed battery-powered light suits worn by runners, Speed of Light harnessed collective action to create a multi-layered night-time animation. NVA's Speed of Light also investigated the physical and emotional aspects to endurance running and the extent to which the power of the mind can override physical pain. A series of related blogs, web portraits, events, lectures and co-commissions were presented in partnership with eight of the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed of Light: Overview|url=http://nvaspeedoflight.org.uk/#!/page/2/Overview|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=OPNAVINST N9210.3, SAFEGUARDING OF NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION (NNPI), 6/7/2010, Unclassified Portion, page 1-1, Definition|accessdate=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all NNPI is [[classified information]].  While most NNPI is sensitive, the Navy recognizes that the public has an interest in [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[safety]], and [[health]] information, and that the basic [[research]] carried out by the Navy can be useful to [[industry]].  Unclassified information is therefore marked with the acronym "U-NNPI", but is still restricted as [[wikt:NOFORN|NOFORN]].&lt;ref&gt;See OPNAVINST N9210.3, esp. Chapters 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

NNPI is explicitly protected information and is not released to the general public without authority.  Those who release even NNPI-U without authority may be administratively punished, and even [[criminal law|criminally]] in the case of NNPI-C.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  NNPI is restricted from disclosure under the Arms Export Control Act, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2778 22 USC §§2778] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2794 2794(7)]; such information is listed in the [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=d148ef6a9390b1e27fc09865c734666c;rgn=div5;view=text;node=22%3A1.0.1.13.60;idno=22;cc=ecfr US Munitions List, 22 CFR §121.1], Category VI, paragraph (g).  

In some instances, small events that would normally be reported as "Events" or LOC (Loss of Control) to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] from other licensees can be classified as NNPI-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Naveta d'Es Tudons''', or '''Naveta of Es Tudons''' (in Menorquí, ''naveta'', or ''naueta'', a diminutive form of ''nau'', means ''nave'',&lt;ref&gt;The monument is sometimes also called ''Nau d'Es Tudons''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Es Tudons'', lit. ''the woodpigeons'', is the name of the place),&lt;ref name=Grinsell&gt;{{harvnb|Grinsell|1975|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most remarkable [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] in the [[Balearic Islands|Balearic island]] of [[Menorca]], Spain.

It is located in the Western part of the island, on the [[Ciutadella de Menorca]]-[[Port Mahon|Mahón]] road, approximately 3 miles out from Ciutadella, and 200 m south of the road. It stands on slightly rising ground in a sloping valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1957|p=67}} [https://archive.org/stream/prehistoricrelig00jame#page/n71/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the Naveta d'Es Tudons is open to the public for visits (except for its interior as a measure of protection). It is one of the main tourist attractions of Menorca.

== History==
In Menorca and Majorca there are several dozen habitational and funerary [[naveta]] complexes, some of which similarly comprise two storeys.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeorgGerster" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fdz/&gt; Navetas (''navetes'' in Menorquí) are chronologically pre-Talaiotic (i.e. prior to the [[Talaiotic culture|Talaiotic age]]) constructions.&lt;ref name=fdz&gt;{{harvnb|Fernández Miranda|1997|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanisharts.com/arquitectura/imagenes/prehistoria/i_navetas.html|title=Navetas, Menorca, Baleares Islands |work=The History Of The Spanish Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navetas were described in the early 19th century but not excavated until the 20th, notably during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="GeorgGerster"&gt;{{harvnb|Gerster|2007|p=250 (Es Tudons in Menorca, Spain)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navetas were first given their name by the rather imaginative Dr Juan Ramis (1818) from their resemblance to upturned boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grinsell|1975|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoskin|Morales Núñez|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naveta d'Es Tudons is the largest and best preserved funerary naveta in Menorca. The Naveta d'Es Tudons served as collective [[ossuary]] between 1200 and 750 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Grant|1997|pp=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower chamber was for stashing the disarticulated bones of the dead after the flesh had been removed&lt;ref name="PhilLee"&gt;Phil Lee, ''The Rough Guide to Menorca'', Rough Guides, 2001, 288 p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; while the upper chamber was probably used for the drying of recently placed corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blake |Knapp|2005| p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating of the bones found in the different funerary navetas in Menorca indicate a usage period between about 1130-820 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Micó |first=Rafael|title=Radiocarbon dating and balearic prehistory: reviewing the  periodization of the prehistoric sequence|journal=Radiocarbon |year=2006|volume=48|issue=3|pages=421–434 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/2886/2649|accessdate=8 May 2012|issn=0033-8222}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the navetas like the Naveta d'Es Tudons are probably older. Pre-Talaiotic constructions are dated using an uncalibrated radiocarbon chronology from 1640 to 1400 BC.&lt;ref name=fdz/&gt; The navetas used for communal burial rituals are dated to the late second millennium and early first millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Lagarda&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagarda i Mata|first=Ferran|title=Es Tudons|url=http://www.menorcaweb.net/arqueologia/menorca/arqme64.htm|work=Menorcaweb.net|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chap" /&gt;

Although listed in the [[Bien de Interés Cultural|Spanish heritage register]] on 3 June 1931 ([http://toolserver.org/%7Eplatonides/wlm/ids.php?bic=RI-51-0003442&amp;userlang=en RI-51-0003442]), the naveta d'Es Tudons was excavated and restored by archaeologist [[Lluís Pericot García]] in 1959-1960. It was found to contain the remains of at least 100 skeletons (one with trepanned skull). Various recovered objects like [[bronze]] bracelets or bone and ceramic buttons &lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menorcaweb.com/reports/archaeological-sites/naveta-des-tudons/|work=MenorcaWeb.com |title=Naveta des Tudons}}&lt;/ref&gt; are today on display in the [[Museu de Menorca]] in Mahón.  Restoration works were carried out and the two or three missing courses at the top were put back in place.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; For protection, it was surrounded at a distance by a recently restored modern dry stone field wall.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Auzias, Jean-Paul Labourdette, ''Baléares, Ibiza&amp;nbsp;— Minorque&amp;nbsp;— Majorque'', Le Petit Fûté, 2012, 336 p., p. 281 : "Inutile de vous extasier sur le mur de pierre sèche qui entoure la Naveta, il est de construction récente" ("There is no need for one to enthuse about the dry stone wall surrounding the Naveta, its construction is recent.")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Plan and Section of Nau d'Es Tudons 1912.png|thumb|left|Plan and section of the unrestored naveta (1912): ''(a)'' low door, ''(b)'' narrow slab-roofed passage, ''(c)'' long rectangular chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peet|1912|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartailhac|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

The shape of the Naveta d'Es Tudons is that of a boat upside down, with the stern as its trapezoidal façade and the bow as its rounded apse. Its groundplan is an elongated semicircle. Externally, the edifice is 14.5 m long by 6.5 m wide and 4.55 m high but it would originally have been 6 m high.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; It is orientated SWS/ENE, the entrance being at the SWS, in the centre of the slightly slanted (or battered) façade.

The front, side walls and apse of the edifice consist of successive horizontal corbelled courses of huge rectangular or square [[limestone]] blocks dressed with a hammer&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guillemard|1907|pp=465–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitted together without mortar, with an all-round foundation course of blocks of even greater size laid on edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/obras/19331.htm|title= Naveta dels Tudons (Ciutadella, Menorca)]|work=artehistoria|quote=''Toda la construcción se ejecutó mediante sillares de buen tamaño dispuestos en hiladas regulares, excepto el zócalo hecho a base de bloques de mayor tamaño que sirven de cimentación.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow, low entrance doorway (0.57 m x 0.75 m) is rebated to receive a closing slab. The once sealed-off entrance leads by a short, flag-roofed passage to an antechamber 1.3 m long and then another short passage to the main or lower chamber (7.45 m x 2.45 m), the ceiling of which is made of giant horizontal slabs inserted into the side walls, with an average span of 1.5 m ''c.'' 2.25 m above the floor. Above this is an upper chamber which is accessible from the upper part of the antechamber. It is slightly shorter (7.10 m) and narrower (1.90 m) than the lower chamber, with a similar although much lower (0.85 m) ceiling of horizontal slabs.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; These have holes in them, presumably for ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonefoundation.org/gallery/sp02.html|title= Tektonika, a photo gallery - an exhibit of photographs of the stonework of the Balearic Islands &amp; the Catalan mainland|work=Stonefoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
According to Phil Lee, the author of ''The Rough Guide to Menorca'', folkloric memories of the navetas' original purpose may have survived into modern times, for the Menorcans were loath to go near these odd-looking and solitary monuments until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="PhilLee" /&gt;

A modern tragic lore tells that two giants were competing for the love of a girl. They agreed that one would build a naveta and the other would dig a water well and the first to finish would marry the girl. As the giant who was building the naveta was about to lay the last stone, the other struck water. Mad with jealousy, the first giant threw the last stone (the one that is missing from the top of the façade) into the well, killing the other giant. Then, feeling remorse, he killed himself. It is said that the girl died a spinster and was buried in the naveta.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''POWER UP''' (the "'''P'''rofessional '''O'''rganization of '''W'''omen in '''E'''ntertainment '''R'''eaching Up") is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] and film [[production company]] with the stated mission "to promote the visibility and integration of [[lesbian|gay women]] in entertainment, the arts, and all forms of media". It was founded in 2000 by  [[K. Pearson Brown]], [[Stacy Codikow]] and [[Amy Shomer]].&lt;ref name="PUHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.power-up.net/celebrity_guests_include.htm |title=Challenging Perception through Film, POWER UP |accessdate=2007-05-15 |work=POWER UP |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427101417/http://www.power-up.net/celebrity_guests_include.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members include women and men, gay and [[heterosexual|straight]].

POWER UP provides funding and assistance to filmmakers, as well as producing its own films. After several [[short film]]s, its first [[feature film]] was the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''[[Itty Bitty Titty Committee]]'' directed by [[Jamie Babbit]].&lt;ref name="AfterEllen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/2/powerlesbians?page=0%2C1 |title=The Top 13 Power Lesbians in Entertainment in 2007 |last=Lo |first=Malinda |date=2007-02-27|work=AfterEllen.com |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, POWER UP was awarded the Leadership Award by the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]].&lt;ref name="AfterEllen" /&gt;

In 2001 K. Pearson Brown, one of the founding members, brought a sexual harassment suit  against another founding member, Stacey Codikow. Codikow counter-sued alleging that Brown had made sexual overtures towards her and accusing Brown of defamation.

The '''papal tombs in old St. Peter's Basilica''' were the final resting places of the [[pope]]s, most which dated from the fifth to sixteenth centuries. The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].

==History==
Along with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]]. As a result, [[Donato Bramante]], the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as "''Mastro Ruinante''".

Although the original basilica's construction was begun during the reign of emperor [[Constantine I]] and completed in the fourth century, [[Pope Leo I]] (440–461) was the first pope buried in the Constantian basilica.&lt;ref name="rear40"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, both the atrium, chapels, and the nave of the basilica were packed with papal tombs, which were juggled between different sections of the church as construction took place on each section of the basilica. All that remains of the original tombs are a few sarcophagi and sculptural fragments.&lt;ref name="r272"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, [[Pope Julius II]], the pope who initiated the destruction of the Constantinian basilica, wished to clear space for a "monstrous" tomb of his own by [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="r274"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known about the placement and appearance of the original tombs: one of the most valuable accounts is that of church canon and historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] (a senator of Genoa and the father of [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]]), who sketched the tombs as they were moved around the basilica on the way to their destruction;&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, Giacomo. Ed. R. Niggl. 1972. ''Descrizione della Basilica Antica di S. Pietro in Vaticano: Codice Barberini Latino 2733''. Vatican City.&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi's sketches record the shape and complexity of the early tombs, many of which were three-tiered.&lt;ref name="r272"/&gt; A few destroyed papal tombs are also detailed in the writings of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]].&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all popes were buried in Rome. ''See [[list of non-extant papal tombs]]''

'''Pholage''' is an artistic technique and method of graphic reproduction  invented by [[Manuel Bennett]] in 1959.

An extension of [[collage]], instead of consisting of mounting numerous pieces of colored paper or other material to make one original, pholage consists of taking positive or [[Negative (photography)|negative]] photographic film images, cutting out sections called "[[masks]]", and reassembling them to create a varied reproduction of the original.  Additional drawings can be added to the color-separated original to further manipulate the original.

While collage yields a single piece of art, pholage can be reproduced by exposing photosensitive paper through the mask, or any other reproductive technique.

'''Pillow Pets''' are a brand of [[stuffed toy]]s with [[Velcro]] straps that allow them to be changed from a decorated pillow into a stuffed animal. The toys are made from [[chenille fabric|chenille]]. Invented by Jennifer Telfer in 2003, Pillow Pets first gained success when Telfer personally sold the toys near the Christmas season of that year. They would later become more successful through [[television advertisement|television advertising]], where the company's famous slogan, "It's a pillow, it's a pet, it's a Pillow Pet!" was in every ad. Pillow Pets have been used for charitable fund raising.

==History==
In 2003, Jennifer Telfer was living in San Diego&lt;ref name="inventor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/about/message-from-the-founder/ | title=Pillow Pets Inventor | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her husband, Clint, and two sons. In an interview with CNBC, Telfer states that she came up with the idea of functional stuffed toys when her oldest son, then seven, flattened out one of his stuffed animals from sleeping with it often.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pillow Pets / Tate's Cookies / Tom's of Maine|series=How I Made My Millions | url=https://www.cnbc.com/video/2011/03/07/how-i-made-my-millions-episode-5.html | accessdate=January 26, 2018 | network=CNBC | airdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She decided on a combination of a pillow and a stuffed animal as the concept for Pillow Pets. Telfer and her husband proposed a meeting with a plush manufacturer at a [[trade fair|tradeshow]] in Las Vegas,&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; and decided to wholesale the toys themselves through their company, CJ Products (CJ is a combination of their first initials).&lt;ref name="inventor2"/&gt; Following the meeting, the Telfers were prepared to sell the first toys.&lt;ref name="adage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adage.com/article/print-edition/pillow-pets-america-s-hottest-brands-2010/147053/ |title= My Pillow Pets |author= Rooney, Jennifer |date= November 15, 2010 |work= Advertising Age |accessdate= March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Pillow Pet was "Snuggly Puppy".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; In the Christmas season, Jennifer Telfer first sold Pillow Pets at mall kiosks, but failed to sell them all: "Every single parent would walk up, and their kids would love them. [The parents would] say, 'No, it's just another stuffed animal.' Because they didn't know that it opened up to a pillow."&lt;ref name="CNBC" /&gt; A few weeks later, Telfer discovered that the Pillow Pets were most profitable during the period after Christmas when they were almost sold out at home shows. She later ordered a container of 7,000 Pillow Pets, now in six different animal varieties, and sold all of them in three months.&lt;ref name="inventor2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/PillowPetsCEOBioFinal2.pdf | title=Jennifer Telfer Biography | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408192147/http://mypillowpets.com/PillowPetsCEOBioFinal2.pdf | archivedate=April 8, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2010, CJ Products earned $300,000 in [[gross (economics)|gross]] sales.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;

In 2009, CJ Products started using [[television advertisement|television advertising]] to promote the Pillow Pets. Commercials aired on children's cable channels such as Nickelodeon, and family-oriented networks such as Travel Channel.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; Partly because of the ads, gross sales of $7,000,000 were recorded at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; Telfer recalled: "I didn't realize that we were gonna be at this level, or people would love my idea as much as I loved it."&lt;ref name="CNBC" /&gt;

In 2012, Dream Lite Pillow Pets were introduced, along with Glow Pets in 2013.

An ordinary Pillow Pet is made with [[chenille fabric]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/about/ | title=About Us | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath it is a velcro strap. Given that it starts in pillow position, its strap fastens to the other side in order to transform it into a stuffed toy. If the strap is unfastened again, the Pillow Pet can again be used as a pillow.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
The original release of Pillow Pets included merely six varieties.&lt;ref&gt;mypillowpetsreview.blogspot.com/2010/09/history-of-my-pillow-pets.html&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more than one hundred varieties of Pillow Pets have been sold by CJ Products. Current varieties range from scented to body pillow pets, they even have a North Dakota State University pillow pet available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;https://mypillowpets.com/shop/accessories/&lt;/ref&gt;  Available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets that exist for [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Football League|NFL]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/sports/ | title=Shop – Sports Teams | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=June 21, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110516105451/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/sports/ | archivedate=May 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also themed Pillow Pets based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/disney/ | title=Shop – Disney | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=October 24, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111018112113/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/disney/ | archivedate=October 18, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuffed toys based on [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Scooby-Doo]], [[Dora the Explorer]], and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] are being produced as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/specialty | title=Shop – Specialty | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=June 21, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111022184444/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/specialty | archivedate=October 22, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CJ Products has also licensed Pillow Pets for three [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football clubs for release in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toynews-online.biz/news/36861/Arsenal-Chelsea-and-Spurs-Pillow-Pets-unveiled |title=Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs Pillow Pets unveiled |publisher=Intent Media |work=ToyNews |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |author=Sacco, Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides stuffed animals, other products bear the Pillow Pets name, such as blankets, slippers, hats, and print pajamas. Three Pillow Pets books and two board games are also available. In late October 2011, a Pillow Pets video game was released for [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/news/pillow-pets-nintendo-ds/ | title=Pillow Pets Is Now Available For Nintendo DS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Pillow Pets World online  has been created, featuring interactive, Pillow Pet related games for children to play for free online.

==Charity work==
CJ Products are known for their charity work, as they have donated Pillow Pets to many causes. In addition to CJ Products, the public have also donated Pillow Pets to help others.

===Indirect===
In December 2010, Michele McFarland, a human resources worker for the Baltimore County Department of Social Services, and her family, all from Catonsville, Maryland, started a Pillow Pet drive to help children at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Their initial goal was to donate 200 toys, but they actually donated 250 Pillow Pets to the hospital in time for Christmas Eve. According to McFarland, residents of New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Georgia helped contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marylandfamilymagazine.com/2010/12/24/catonsville-family-leads-drive-to-donate-pillow-pets-to-childrens-center/ | title=Catonsville family leads drive to donate Pillow Pets to children’s center | work=Maryland Family Magazine | date=December 24, 2010 | accessdate=March 6, 2011 | author=Conlin, Brian | location=Catonsville, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, it was announced that McFarland aimed to donate even more Pillow Pets to five hospitals, including Johns Hopkins, by Christmas. She became affiliated with the Casey Cares Foundation and ordered 1,400 Pillow Pets to help the hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/baltimorecounty/news/community/ph-ca-pillow-pets-1123-20111121,0,2872787.story | title=Catonsville woman aims to comfort children not just during holidays | publisher=Tribune Company | work=Baltimore Sun | date=November 21, 2011 | accessdate=November 22, 2011 | author=Conlin, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob McConahay (then seven) and his family accepted donations of Pillow Pets in the [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children|Riley Hospital for Children]], in [[Indianapolis]], where Jacob was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. An early childhood volunteer mentioned that Jacob's goal was 1,000 Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfromyou.indystar.com/posts/cancer-doesn-t-hold-jake-back-from-collecting-pillow-pets | title=Cancer doesn't hold Jake back from collecting Pillow Pets | work=The Indianopolis Star | date=February 7, 2011 | accessdate=March 5, 2011 | author=Welty, Lauren | location=Indianopolis, Indiana | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711192602/http://newsfromyou.indystar.com/posts/cancer-doesn-t-hold-jake-back-from-collecting-pillow-pets | archivedate=July 11, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CJ Products had heard about Jacob's goal, and they committed to matching the number of Pillow Pets that he collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpetsblog.com/help-support-pillow-pets%e2%84%a2-for-jacob/ | title=Help Support Pillow Pets for Jacob | publisher=My Pillow Pets Blog | date=March 9, 2011 | accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConahay's wish to help children in the Riley Hospital inspired students at China Grove Middle School in North Carolina to donate Pillow Pets to patients at the Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salisburypost.com/News/041411-edu-MUST-China-Grove-pillow-pets-PIC-qcd | title=School collects Pillow Pets for Jeff Gordon’s Children’s Hospital | publisher=Post Publishing Company | work=The Salisbury Post | date=April 14, 2011 | accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob died on August 31, 2011. {{as of|November 2011}} his family has collected over 140,000 Pillow Pets in his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dunedin.patch.com/articles/pillow-pets-to-honor-young-cancer-victim | title=Pillow Pets, Vigil to Honor Late 7-Year-Old | publisher=DunedinPatch | date=November 17, 2011 | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Dolac, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct===
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in Japan, CJ Products, [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], and the [[American Red Cross]], collaborated to support relief efforts. Pillow Pets announced that they would donate one dollar of every purchase of a Pillow Pet on their website, on March 17 and 18, 2011, to the American Red Cross. They also auctioned five Pillow Pets on the same days, and the money also went to the American Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpetsblog.com/support-relief-efforts-in-japan-with-pillow-pets-plush-animals-the-today-show-the-american-red-cross/ | title=Support Relief Efforts in Japan with Pillow Pets plush animals, The Today Show &amp; the American Red Cross | publisher=My Pillow Pets Blog | date=March 17, 2011 | accessdate=March 18, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714001541/http://mypillowpetsblog.com/support-relief-efforts-in-japan-with-pillow-pets-plush-animals-the-today-show-the-american-red-cross/ | archivedate=July 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Pillow Pets has collaborated with the Family Reach Foundation to help families of children to fight cancer. In September 2011, the foundation received a donation of 6,200 Pillow Pets and was able to generate thousands of dollars in funds. Carla Tardif, the Foundations' director of development and special programs, stated a consideration of initiatives to create more promotion of Family Reach's cause and raise charitable funds for families worldwide. "We applaud the tremendous amount of work being done by the Family Reach Foundation on behalf of [the] families," Jennifer Telfer said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familyreach.org/news/family-reach-receives-major-donation-of-pillow-pets%E2%84%A2/ | title=Family Reach Receives Major Donation of Pillow Pets to Support its Mission | publisher=Family Reach Foundation | date=September 28, 2011 | accessdate=November 20, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085418/http://www.familyreach.org/news/family-reach-receives-major-donation-of-pillow-pets%E2%84%A2/ | archivedate=April 26, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeits==
Some toy companies have taken advantage of Pillow Pets' popularity by manufacturing and selling counterfeits. CJ Products have been notified many times of impostor Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://mypillowpets.com/HOLIDAYSHOPPERS-BEWAREOFPILLOWPETS%20IMPOSTORS12-21-10.pdf | title=Holiday Shoppers: Beware of Pillow Pets Impostors | date=December 21, 2009 | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telfer said: "It is priority one for us to protect our brand and deliver the high quality people have come to expect when they see the My Pillow Pets plush folding stuffed animals authentic tag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pets4home.net/consumers-help-combat-my-pillow-pets-plush-folding-stuffed-animal-fraud/ | title=Consumers Help Combat My Pillow Pets Plush Folding Stuffed Animal Fraud | publisher=Pets 4 Home | date=September 7, 2010 | accessdate=November 19, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224152/http://www.pets4home.net/consumers-help-combat-my-pillow-pets-plush-folding-stuffed-animal-fraud/ | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, in January 2011, Concord Toys International were accused of selling fake Pillow Pets. Their products were being sold in a warehouse in Queens, New York City and bore the label "[[Made in China]]." Private detectives hired by CJ Products tracked the toys to the warehouse, where U.S. marshals seized 17,000 counterfeits. An injunction was signed preventing Concord from manufacturing any forgeries, and CJ Products are seeking punitive damages against the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-25/news/27096545_1_pillow-pets-federal-court-lawyers | title=Fake Thumpy, Squeaky in custody as lawyers for Pillow Pets seek damages for counterfeit items | work=New York Daily News | date=January 25, 2011 | accessdate=March 5, 2011 | author=Marzulli, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pomander, from [[French language|French]] ''pomme d'ambre'', i.e., apple of amber, is a ball made for perfumes, such as [[ambergris]] (whence the name), [[musk]], or [[civet (perfumery)|civet]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The pomander was worn or carried in a vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against [[infection]] in times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad smells.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The globular cases which contained the pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or belt, or attached to the girdle, and were usually perforated in a variety of [[openwork]] techniques, and made of gold or silver.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a different perfume.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}}

The term "pomander" can refer to the scented material itself or to the container that which contains such material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larsdatter.com/pomanders.htm|title=Pomanders|work=larsdatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/dictionarypomander.html POMANDER MEMENTO MORI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corine Schleif and Volker Schier, ''Katerina's Windows: Donation and Devotion, Art and Music, as Heard and Seen Through the Writings of a Birgittine Nun,'' University Park: Penn State Press, 2009, pp. 237, 242-244&lt;/ref&gt; The container could be made of gold or silver and eventually evolved to be shaped like nuts, skulls, hearts, books and ships. Smaller versions were made to be attached by a chain to a finger ring and held in the hand. Even smaller versions served as cape buttons or rosary beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher= ganoskin|accessdate= 12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pomander can be a bag containing fragrant herbs and might be viewed as an early form of [[aromatherapy]]. Pomanders can be considered related to [[censer]]s, in which aromatics are burned or roasted rather than naturally evaporated.

==History==
Pomanders were first mentioned in literature in the mid-thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_hispanic_studies/v086/86.1.twomey.html|title=Project MUSE - The Bulletin of Hispanic Studies - Perfumes and perfume-making in the Celestina|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in the late [[Middle Ages]] through the 17th century.&lt;ref name="groom274"&gt;Groom, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;
Also a version of the pomander with oranges, [[clove]]s, oils, and a golden ribbon can be used as a recovery charm in witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth-n-home.blogspot.com/2011/12/pomander-recovery-spell-and-charm.html|title=Hearth-n-Home: Pomander Recovery spell and charm|author=Mamma Kay|work=hearth-n-home.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://begumafreedaali.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-magical-pomander.html|title=A-Magical Pomander ~ Begum Afreeda Ali|work=begumafreedaali.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcheslore.com/bookofshadows/rituals-spell-casting/magic-and-spell-casting/2537/|title=Magic and Spell-Casting - Witchcraft - Pagan, Wiccan, Occult and Magick|work=witcheslore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spellsofmagic.com/coven_spells.html?coven=6&amp;slist=7|title=Cure Spells|work=SpellsOfMagic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Pomanders were first made for carrying as religious keepsakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/jewelry-history/jewelry-history-page11.htm Jewelry of the middle ages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
The ''Archaeological Journal'', Volume 31 of 1874 describes on page 339 a 1584 formula for making a pomander that was also published by [[Frederic Madden]] in his 1831 history book ''Privy purse expenses of the Princess Mary, daughter of [[King Henry the Eighth]], afterwards [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'' on page 257:

{{Quote|[[Benzoin resin]], [[calamite]], [[labdanum]], and [[storax balsam]] were ground into a powder, dissolved in [[rose water]] and put into a pan over a fire to cook together. The cooked mixture was then removed from the fire, rolled into an apple shape and coated with a powdered mixture of cinnamon, sweet sanders, and cloves.

After this, a concoction was made from three grains each of [[ambergris]], [[deer musk]], and [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. The ambergris was dissolved first and the deer and civet musk mixed in later. The "apple" ball was rolled through the musk concoction to blend in these ingredients and then kneaded to combine and molded back into the shape of an apple.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nostradamus====
[[Michel de Nostredame]] had a similar method and formula using similar ingredients, but a rather different procedure.

"Rose tablets" were made by soaking a pound of roses without the flower heads in [[deer musk]] water overnight. The water was then thoroughly squeezed out and the roses ground with seven ounces of [[benzoin resin|benzoin]], a quarter of [[ambergris]] and another of [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. This mixture was made into tablets, which were each sandwiched between rose petals and dried in a cool, dark area&lt;ref name=Boeser11&gt;Boeser (chapter 11)&lt;/ref&gt;

To form the final pomander, two ounces of the purest [[labdanum]], an ounce each of [[Styrax]] calamites and benzoin resin, half an ounce of the rose tablets, one ounce of violet powder, and half a [[dram (unit)|dram]] each ambergris and musk were ground into a powder and kneaded with the rose-musk water from the production of the rose tablets. This produced "an aromatic ball of the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name=Boeser11/&gt;

====Pouncet box====
In the late 16th century the pouncet box appeared which, whilst retaining the traditional features of the pomander, was designed to hold liquid perfumes, blended with powder and absorbed on a sponge or piece of cotton. It was favoured by the upper classes who appreciated the delicacy of the liquid perfumes. Its name stemmed from the fact that the box was "pounced" or pierced to release the scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher=Ganoskin|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Orange pomander.jpg|thumb|An orange studded with [[clove]]s.]]

One modern style of pomander is made by studding an orange or other fruit with whole dried [[clove]]s and letting it [[curing (food preservation)|cure dry]], after which it may last several years. This modern pomander serves the functions of perfuming and freshening the air and also of keeping drawers of clothing and linens fresh, pleasant-smelling, and moth-free.

==Culture==
A pomander is worn by [[Mia Farrow|Rosemary Woodhouse]], in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1968 film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. It figures as a central part of the plot development.

The pouncet box is mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV Part I]]'' when Hotspur is accused of withholding Scottish nobles captured in a skirmish and in self-defence pleads, in describing the King's messenger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::He was perfumèd like a milliner,
::And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held
::A pouncet box, which ever and anon
::He gave his nose and took’t away again,
::Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
::Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==
Medieval pomander paste formulas usually contained ambergris. From this came "pomme ambre" (amber apple) and from there the word ''pomander'' was developed.&lt;ref name="groom274"/&gt; Other names for the pomander are Ambraapfel, Bisamapfel, Bisamknopf, Bisambüchse, balsam apple, Desmerknopf, musk ball Desmerapfel, Oldanokapsel, Pisambüchse, and smelling apple.

The '''rock sculpture of  Decebalus''' is a 42.9 m in height and 31.6 m in width carving in rock of the face of [[Decebalus]], the last king of [[Dacia]], who fought against the Roman emperors [[Domitian]] and [[Trajan]] to preserve the independence of his country, which corresponded to modern [[Romania]]. The sculpture was made between 1994 and 2004, on a rocky outcrop on the river [[Danube]], at the [[Iron Gates]], which form the border between Romania and Serbia. It is located near the city of [[Orșova]] in Romania. 

It is the tallest [[rock relief]] in Europe.

==Creation==
It was commissioned by Romanian businessman [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]] and it took 10 years, from 1994 to 2004, for twelve sculptors to finish it.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Schily, Matthias Eickhoff, ''Donau: von Regensburg zum Schwarzen Meer'', DuMont Reiseverlag, 2010, p.237.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Drăgan's website, the businessman purchased the rock in 1993, after which the Italian sculptor Mario Galeotti assessed the location and made an initial model. The first six years involved dynamiting the rock into the basic shape, and the remaining four years were devoted to completing the detail.&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decebalusrex.ro/en/istoricul-2.php |title=Fundatia Europeana Dragan, DECEBALUS REX DRAGAN FECIT, History of the monument |publisher=Decebalusrex.ro |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814124251/http://www.decebalusrex.ro/en/istoricul-2.php |archivedate=2014-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the face of Decebalus there is a Latin inscription which reads "DECEBALUS REX—DRAGAN FECIT" ("King Decebalus—Made by Drăgan"). The carving was placed opposite an ancient memorial plaque, carved in the rock on the [[Serbia]]n side of the river facing Romania. The plaque, known as the [[Tabula Traiana]], records the completion of Trajan's military road along the [[Danube]] and thus commemorates the final defeat of Decebalus by Trajan in 105, and the absorption of the Dacian kingdom into the [[Roman Empire]]. Drăgan wanted the Serbs to carve a giant head of a Roman Emperor, as if confronting Decebalus on the opposite side of the river, but the Serbs refused.&lt;ref name = "nick"/&gt;

==Significance==


Drăgan was a leading figure in the [[protochronism]] movement, a nationalist ideology which attempted to portray Romania as the major cradle of civilisation and which identified Romania with an ancient [[Thracian]] empire that supposedly dominated central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Verdery, National Ideology under Socialism. Identity and Cultural Politics in Ceaușescu's Romania, University of California Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In this ideology, Dacia, the pre-Roman name of Romania, was the inheritor of this Thracian culture, a view expounded by Drăgan in his book and journal ''Noì, tracii'' ("We Thracians").&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Fundatia Europeana Dragan'', Drăgan's foundation, states that "Giuseppe Costantino Dragan is a strong supporter of the theory that the original 'flame' of civilization started on the ancient territory of Romania and argues as much in his work".&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"/&gt; Drăgan saw the sculpture as a signpost to the cradle of civilisation. He is quoted saying, "Anyone travelling towards 'Decebal Rex Dragan Fecit' is also travelling towards the origins of European civilization and will discover that a United Europe represents the natural course of history".&lt;ref name="Decebalusrex"/&gt;

==Descriptions==


[[Michael Palin]] in his 2007 book ''[[New Europe (book)|New Europe]]'' described the colossal head: 

{{quote|As we move into the Kazan Gorge, where a small valley enters the Danube from the Romanian shore, an enormous head is carved into the rock together with the Latin inscription 'Decebalus Rex - Dragan Fecit'. It turns out to be less ancient than I thought, in fact it dates from the 1990s. The carved figure, Decebalus, was a Dacian king who took on the armies of Emperor Trajan and is regarded as a great Romanian folk hero. Dragan, more prosaically, is a rich businessman who paid for it to be carved. On this slightly ominous note of resurgent nationalism, we pass into the gorge itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palinstravels.co.uk/book-4270 |title=Palin's travels |publisher=Palinstravels.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nick Thorpe]] in ''The Danube: A Journey Upriver from the Black Sea to the Black Forest'' writes, {{quote|Upstream from the church, the bulbous features of Decebal, moustachioed and wide-eyed, have been carved into the rock face, forty meters high and twenty five wide. The ancient Dacian leader stares across the river at the opposite cliff...The cliff, rising above his head into the wooded slope, provides him with the illusion of a large forehead or a pointed wizard's hat.&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Thorpe, Nick, ''The Danube: A Journey Upriver from the Black Sea to the Black Forest'', Yale University Press, 2014. p.336.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Royal Scottish National Orchestra''' (RSNO) is a Scottish orchestra, administratively based in [[Glasgow]] at the RSNO Centre.  The RSNO receives support from the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/03/29094643 | title=National performing companies get official status | publisher=Scottish Government | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RSNO performs throughout Scotland, at such venues as [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Usher Hall]] ([[Edinburgh]]), [[Caird Hall]] ([[Dundee]]), [[Aberdeen Music Hall]], [[Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)|Perth Concert Hall]] or [[Eden Court Theatre|Eden Court Inverness]]. The current chief executive director of the RSNO is Krishna Thiagarajan.  [[Thomas Søndergård]] is the orchestra's current music director, since 2018.

==History==
The precursor ensemble to the RSNO was established in 1843 to accompany the Glasgow Choral Union (today known as the RSNO Chorus).  In 1891, the orchestra was recognised formally as the ''Scottish Orchestra'', with [[George Henschel]] as the ensemble's first principal conductor under that name. In 1950, the orchestra took the name of the ''Scottish National Orchestra''.  The orchestra received [[patronage|royal patronage]] in 1977.  It continued to use the name 'Scottish National Orchestra' until 1991, when it briefly used the title ''Royal Scottish Orchestra'', before changing to its present name.

The orchestra's longest-serving principal conductor was Sir [[Alexander Gibson (conductor)|Alexander Gibson]], its first native Scottish principal conductor, from 1959 to 1984.  During Gibson's tenure, beginning in 1979, the RSNO's base was at [[Henry Wood Hall, Glasgow|Henry Wood Hall]] in Glasgow and this space was also used as its recording venue.  Gibson was particularly noted for his interpretations of [[Scandinavia]]n composers, notably [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen]].  His successor, [[Neeme Järvi]], continued this tradition, and also led the orchestra through its first complete [[Gustav Mahler]] cycle.  Principal conductor from 1984 to 1988, Järvi currently has the title of conductor laureate with the RSNO.  [[Bryden Thomson]], the orchestra's second Scottish principal conductor, maintained the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] link with a cycle of Nielsen symphonies.

[[Alexander Lazarev]] was principal conductor of the RSNO from 1997 to 2005, and now has the title of conductor emertius with the orchestra.  [[Marin Alsop]] was the RSNO's principal guest conductor from 2000 to 2003, the first woman to hold the title.  Garry Walker succeeded Alsop as principal guest conductor, serving from 2003 to 2007.  [[Stéphane Denève]] was music director of the RSNO from 2005 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/national-orchestra-maestro-to-leave-scotland-1.1010874 | title=National orchestra maestro to leave Scotland | publisher=The Herald | author=Phil Miller | date=4 March 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure, the RSNO recorded music of Debussy and of [[Albert Roussel]], the latter for Naxos.

In January 2011, the RSNO announced the appointment of [[Peter Oundjian]] as its next music director, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rsno.org.uk/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=638:oundjian-succeeds-stephane-deneve-in-2012-at-the-helm-of-scotlands-national-orchestra-.html&amp;Itemid=81 | title=Peter Oundjian to be RSNO’s new Music Director | publisher=Royal Scottish National Orchestra | date=31 January 2011 | accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/leading-violinist-gets-top-role-at-rsno-1.1082938 | title=Leading violinist gets top role at RSNO | publisher=The Herald | author=Phil Miller | date=1 February 2011 | accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In October 2011, [[Thomas Søndergård]] was named the orchestra's principal guest conductor, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 3 years for 3 programmes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rsno.org.uk/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=697:thomas-sondergard-joins-rsno-artistic-team.html&amp;Itemid=81 | title=Thomas Søndergård joins RSNO Artistic Team | publisher=Royal Scottish National Orchestra | date=18 October 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the orchestra took up new residence at the RSNO Centre and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.  The RSNO's current assistant conductor is Holly Mathieson, since September 2016.  Oundjian is scheduled to conclude his tenure as RSNO music director after the close of the 2017-2018 season.  In May 2017, the RSNO announced the appointment of Søndergård as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2018-2019 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/music/15310504.RSNO_names_its_new_Music_Director/ | title=RSNO names its new Music Director | publisher=The Herald | author=Keith Bruce | date=2017-05-25 | accessdate=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017, the RSNO appointed [[Elim Chan]] as its next principal guest conductor, effective 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rsno.org.uk/rsno-principal-guest-conductor-appointment/ | title=RSNO Principal Guest Conductor appointment | publisher=Royal Scottish National Orchestra | date=20 June 2017 | accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; following her first guest-conducting appearance with the RSNO in January 2017 and a return engagement a fortnight later as an emergency substitute for [[Neeme Järvi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/music-review-the-rsno-elim-chan-1-4372553 | title=Music review: The RSNO &amp; Elim Chan | work=The Scotsman | author=Susan Nickalls | date=2017-02-21 | accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSNO Chorus and RSNO Junior Chorus==
The affiliated choruses of the RSNO are the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra Chorus|RSNO Chorus]] and the RSNO Junior Chorus.  The RSNO Chorus evolved from a choir formed in 1843 to sing the first full performance of Handel's ''Messiah'' in Scotland, in April 1844.  In addition to its commitment to the RSNO, the Chorus performs independently and has toured worldwide. The current chorus director is [[Gregory Batsleer]].

In 1978, Jean Kidd formed the RSNO Junior Chorus.  Since 1994, its director has been Christopher Bell.  The RSNO Junior Chorus has a membership of around 400 singers, aged from eight to eighteen.  The members learn to sing using the [[Zoltán Kodály]] method of training.

==Recordings==
The orchestra has had a long-standing recording contract with [[Chandos Records]], particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.  The RSNO has also recorded for [[Naxos Records]], most notably in a cycle of [[Anton Bruckner]] symphonies with the [[Georg Tintner]], cycles of [[Arnold Bax]] symphonies with [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]], and several recordings of American works (including the complete orchestral works of [[Samuel Barber]]) conducted by [[Marin Alsop]].  With Denève, their first Roussel recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/08/classicalmusicandopera.shopping1 | title=Roussel: Bacchus et Ariane; Symphony No 3, RSNO/ Denève | publisher=The Guardian | author=Tim Ashley | date=8 June 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the Diapason d'Or de l'année for Symphonic Music.  The second disc in the series was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/13/classicalmusicandopera3 | title=Roussel: Symphony No 2; Suite in F; Pour une Fête de Printemps, RSNO/ Denève | publisher=The Guardian | author=Tim Ashley | date=13 June 2008 | accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sin-eater''' is a person who consumes a ritual meal in order to [[Magic (supernatural)|magically]] take on the [[sin]]s of a person or household. The food was believed to absorb the sins of a recently deceased person, thus [[Absolution of the dead|absolving]] the soul of the person. Sin-eaters, as a consequence,  carried the sins of all people whose sins they had eaten. [[Cultural anthropologists]] and [[folklorist]]s classify sin-eating as a form of [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[ritual]]&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QHPYAAAAMAAJ ''Boundaries &amp; Thresholds''] p.85 quotation: {{quotation|It is this fear of what the dead in their uncontrollable power might cause which has brought forth apotropaic rites, protective rites against the dead. [...] One of these popular rites was the funeral rite of sin-eating, performed by a sin-eater, a man or woman. Through accepting the food and drink provided, he took upon himself the sins of the departed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[magic and religion|religious magic]].

==History==
Although the figure of the sin-eater has had various references in modern culture, the questions of how common the practice was, what regions of the world in which it was most common, and what the interactions between sin-eaters, common people, and religious authorities were, remain largely unstudied and in the realm of folklore.

In mythology, [[Tlazolteotl]], the Aztec goddess of earth, motherhood and fertility, had a redemptive role in the religious practices of the [[Meso-American]] civilization.  At the end of an individual's life, he was allowed to confess his misdeeds to this deity, and according to legend she would cleanse his soul by "eating its filth".

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] has been interpreted as a universal archetype for sin-eaters, offering his life to atone or purify all of humanity of their sins.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last=Walford Davies, Richard Marggraf Turley |first=Damian |title=The Monstrous Debt: Modalities of Romantic Influence in Twentieth-century Literature|year=2006 |publisher=Wayne State University |isbn=0814330584 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVh_qVyFt6kC&amp;d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bagford]], (ca.1650–1716) includes the following description of the sin-eating ritual in his ''letter on Leland’s Collectanea'', i. 76. (as cited in [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]], 1898)
{{quote|Notice was given to an old sire before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket [low stool], on which he sat down facing the door; then they gave him a groat which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread which he ate, and a bowl of ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced the case and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.}}

A local legend in [[Shropshire]], [[England]], concerns the grave of Richard Munslow, who died in 1906, said to be the last sin-eater of the area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-11360659 | title=Last 'sin-eater' to be celebrated with church service | date=19 September 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-19 | work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|By eating bread and drinking ale, and by making a short speech at the graveside, the sin-eater took upon themselves the sins of the deceased". The speech was written as: "I give easement and rest now to thee, dear man. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html The Sin Eaters' Grave at Ratlinghope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208141333/http://www.shropshiregallery.co.uk/towns/ratlinghope/ratlinghope.html |date=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1926 book ''Funeral Customs'' by [[Bertram S. Puckle]] mentions the sin-eater:
{{quote|Professor Evans of the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen, actually saw a sin-eater about the year 1825, who was then living near [[Llanwenog]], [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]]. Abhorred by the superstitious villagers as a thing unclean, the sin-eater cut himself off from all social intercourse with his fellow creatures by reason of the life he had chosen; he lived as a rule in a remote place by himself, and those who chanced to meet him avoided him as they would a leper. This unfortunate was held to be the associate of [[evil spirits]], and given to [[witchcraft]], incantations and unholy practices; only when a death took place did they seek him out, and when his purpose was accomplished they burned the wooden bowl and platter from which he had eaten the food handed across, or placed on the corpse for his consumption.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/fcod/fcod07.htm SacredTexts.com: Food]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Howlett mentions sin-eating as an old custom in [[Hereford]], and thus describes the practice: "The corpse being taken out of the house, and laid on a bier, a loaf of bread was given to the sin-eater over the corpse, also a maga-bowl of maple, full of beer. These consumed, a fee of sixpence was given him for the consideration of his taking upon himself the sins of the deceased, who, thus freed, would not walk after death."

The [[Britannica 1911|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] states in its article on "sin eaters":
{{quote|A symbolic survival of it (''sin eating'') was witnessed as recently as 1893 at Market Drayton, [[Shropshire]]. After a preliminary service had been held over the coffin in the house, a woman poured out a glass of wine for each bearer and handed it to him across the coffin with a 'funeral biscuit.' In Upper [[Bavaria]] sin-eating still survives: a corpse cake is placed on the breast of the dead and then eaten by the nearest relative, while in the [[Balkan peninsula]] a small bread image of the deceased is made and eaten by the survivors of the family. The Dutch doed-koecks or '[[dead-cakes]]', marked with the initials of the deceased, introduced into America in the 17th century, were long given to the attendants at funerals in old [[New York (state)|New York]]. The 'burial-cakes' which are still made in parts of rural England, for example [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Cumberland]], are almost certainly a relic of sin-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911||wstitle=Sin-eater|volume=25|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge''''' is a painting attributed to  the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Caravaggio|Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] (1571–1610).

The picture has been variously dated between 1601 and 1610 (Caravaggio scholar John T. Spike lists the date as circa 1603 in the second revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johntspike.com/uploads/CARAVA_2010.pdf|title=Caravaggio, Second Revised Edition|last=Spike|first=John T.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his study of the artist). It depicts a wicker basket heaped with various fruit and vegetables sitting on a stone table, caught in Caravaggio's usual strong yet mellow shaft of [[top-left lighting|light falling from top left]], "as if through a hole in the ceiling." (Caravaggio at around this time was sued by a landlady for having cut a hole in the ceiling of the rooms he rented, presumably to create his characteristic lighting). The bulk of the space is taken up by the large melons, marrows and pumpkins, the watermelon and pumpkin cut open to display the interior, the marrows, long and twisting, seeming to wish to escape the two-dimensional space of the picture plane.

While at one level the painting is a bravura study of texture and form and light, the [[Renaissance]] symbology of fruit and vegetables was rich and intricate, and given this fact and the fact that so many of Caravaggio's apparently simple paintings, such as ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'', in fact carry coded messages, it is not unlikely that the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' is equally complex. Nevertheless, no plausible reading has so far been advanced, although several commentators have noted the visual suggestiveness of the moistly cut fruits and melons and the writhing, thrusting marrows.

It was first recorded in the collection of Cardinal [[Antonio Barberini]] in 1671, as being "in the hand" of the artist; how it came to be there (and this is the first recorded mention of its existence) is open to speculation, but Barberini is known to have bought up part of the collection of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], Caravaggio's first patron, when the cardinal died in 1627 . It may therefore have been a private work for Del Monte.

Another possibility is that in 1644 Cardinal Antonio Barberini inherited the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' from his uncle, Pope Urban VIII, who was the greatest patron of the Roman Baroque and an avid art collector. It is documented that in 1603, while he was still a cardinal, Urban VIII acquired a number of paintings directly from Caravaggio.  The ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' could easily have been one of these.  It shares the same dimensions and the same palette as the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' now at the Uffizi, which is known to have been part of this group and which dates from the same period in Caravaggio's career.

Caravaggio has justly been credited as the father of Roman still-life painting, a genre which was in its infancy in the early 17th century.  Although Caravaggio very frequently included still-life elements in his works, only two independent still lifes from his hand have been identified to date. These are the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' and the ''Basket of Fruit'' at the Ambrosiana in Milan. Because of both the extraordinary virtuosity of its execution and the complexity of meaning suggested by its composition, scholars have referred to the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' as a "capital picture for the artist" and a "masterpiece of still life."

The '''Symphony No. 2''' in [[D major]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 36, is a symphony in four movements written by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] between 1801 and 1802. The work is dedicated to [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]].

==Background==
Beethoven's Second Symphony was mostly written during Beethoven's stay at [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]] in 1802, at a time when his deafness was becoming more pronounced and he began to realize that it might be incurable. The work was premiered in the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna on 5 April 1803, and was conducted by the composer. During that same concert, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]] and the oratorio ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]'' were also debuted.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;Steinberg, M. ''The Concerto: A Listener's Guide'', p.59–63, Oxford (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the last works of Beethoven's so-called "early period".

Beethoven wrote the Second Symphony without a standard [[minuet]]; instead, a [[scherzo]] took its place, giving the composition even greater scope and energy. The scherzo and the finale are filled with Beethovenian musical jokes, which shocked the sensibilities of many contemporary critics. One Viennese critic for the ''Zeitung fuer die elegante Welt'' (Newspaper for the Elegant World) famously wrote of the Symphony that it was "a hideously writhing, wounded dragon that refuses to die, but writhing in its last agonies and, in the fourth movement, bleeding to death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/4147.html#tvf=tracks&amp;tv=about Beethoven Symphony No. 2], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s in A, two [[bassoon]]s, two [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] in D, E and A, two [[trumpet]]s in D (first, third and fourth movements only), [[timpani]] (first, third and fourth movements only) and [[String section|strings]]. The composer also made a [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of the entire symphony for [[piano trio]] which bears the same [[opus number]].

This symphony consists of four movements:
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Adagio molto]], {{music|time|3|4}} – [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] con [[Glossary_of_musical_terminology#B|brio]], {{music|time|4|4}} ([[D major]])
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Larghetto]], {{music|time|3|8}} ([[A major]])
#[[Scherzo]]: Allegro, {{music|time|3|4}} (D major)
#Allegro molto, {{music|time|2|2}} (D major)

A typical performance runs 33 to 36 minutes.

===First movement===
The Introduction, ''Adagio molto'', begins in D major, changing to [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] in [[Bar (music)|measure]] 11. In measures 12-16, it briefly [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] to B{{music|flat}} major and immediately back to D. The [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] (Allegro con brio) begins in D major with the A theme lasting until measure 57. A transition towards the B theme lasts until measure 72, modulating to [[A minor]] at measure 61. The B theme begins in A major at 73, moving to A minor again at 113 with a [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]] from measure 117–136 (moving to D major in measure 120). The [[Development (music)|development]] uses material from the A theme, going through several modulations throughout and making use of the main idea from Theme A in sequence. At measure 216, the A theme returns in the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], lasting until measure 228. There is a retransition from 229–244, bringing back the B theme at measure 245, this time in the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[Key (music)|key]]. At 327, B{{music|flat}} major returns briefly, moving back to D in 334 with a [[coda (music)|Coda]] from measures 340–360.

===Second movement===
This movement, ''Larghetto'', is in the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] key of A major and is one of Beethoven's longest symphonic slow movements. There are clear indications of the influence of folk music and the pastoral, presaging his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 ("Pastoral")]].

The movement, like the first, is in [[sonata form]]. [[Franz Schubert]] quoted from the movement in the second movement of his [[Sonata in C major for piano four-hands, D 812 (Schubert)|Grand Duo]] for piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grove|first1=George C. B.|title=Beethoven and His Nine Symphonies|date=1962|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|pages=28–33|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third movement===
This movement, ''Scherzo: Allegro'', encloses a melodious oboe and bassoon quartet within a typical-sounding Austrian side-slapping dance.

===Fourth movement===
The fourth movement, ''Allegro molto'', is composed of very rapid string passages. Musicologist [[Robert Greenberg]] of the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]] describes the highly unusual opening [[Motif (music)|motif]] as a hiccup, belch or flatulence followed by a groan of pain. According to Greenberg:

{{quote|Beethoven's gastric problems, particularly in times of great stress – like the fall of 1802 – were legendary. ... It has been understood almost since the day of its premiere that that is what this music is all about. Beethoven never refuted it; in fact, he must have encouraged it. Otherwise, how could such an interpretation become common coin? And common coin it is.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenberg, ''The Symphonies of Beethoven'', "Symphony No. 2: Beethoven at the Edge II", The Teaching Company (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist and composer Bryan Townsend refers to this assertion by Greenberg as "an example of musicological overreach".&lt;ref&gt;http://themusicsalon.blogspot.com/2013/07/beethoven-symphony-no-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg doesn't cite any references to back this interpretation he puts forth in his courses "The symphonies of Beethoven" and "How to listen to and understand great music".

'''Systemic design''' is a recent initiative in design that integrates [[systems thinking]] and [[human-centered design]], with the intention of helping designers cope with complex design projects. 
The recent challenges to design coming from the increased complexity caused by globalization, migration, sustainability render traditional design methods insufficient. Designers need better ways to design responsibly and to avoid unintended side-effects. 
Systemic design intends to develop methodologies and approaches that help to integrate systems thinking with design towards sustainability at environmental, social and economic level. It is a pluralistic initiative where many different approaches are encouraged to thrive and where dialogue and organic development of new practices is central.

The systemic design dialogue is driven by the '''Relating Systems Thinking and Design''' (RSD) symposium series resulting in published proceedings and several special issues on systemic design in the scientific design research journal FORMakademisk.

==Academic groups==
Systemic design is being developed within the design practice and through the '''Systemic Design Research Network''', focusing on different aspects of the issue.&lt;ref name="systemic-design.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/sdrn/|title=Systemic Design Research Network « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different academic groups have been facing Systemic Design both in their teaching and researching activities:
*  '''Systems oriented design''' is an example of a systemic design approach being used at the '''Oslo School of Architecture and Design'''. Systems Oriented Design seeks to train the designers ability to cope with a larger degree of complexity and to take more responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Holistic perspectives, ethics and sustainability as well as cultural, organizational, economic, and technical considerations are central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aho.no/en/|title=The Oslo School of Architecture and Design|author=|date=|website=aho.no|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At '''[[Politecnico di Torino]]''', the '''Master of Science in Systemic Design''' is active and it is named after Aurelio Peccei, in that place didactics and research are growing up together.&lt;ref&gt;Barbero, S. (2016). Opportunities and challenges in teaching Systemic Design. The evolution of the Open Systems master courses at Politecnico di Torino. Proceedings of the 6th International Forum of Design as a Process, Universitat Politècnica de València, Valencia, pp. 57-66.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, put forward by Luigi Bistagnino, focuses on the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system, by viewing waste as a valuable resource.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemicdesign.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Research on Systemic Design at Politecnico di Torino is now led by Silvia Barbero.
* The '''Strategic Foresight and innovation master''' program at '''OCAD University''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocadu.ca/academics/graduate-studies/strategic-foresight-and-innovation.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto is a well known systemic design initiative led by Peter H. Jones. Emphasis is placed on teaching complex problem finding, framing and solving, to envision and develop sustainable futures. 
* At the '''[[National Institute of Design]]''' (NID) '''India''' there is a group of academics at the design department, established by late M.P. Ranjan and led by Praween Nahar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/rsd2/teaching-systemic-design/#nahar/|title=Teaching Systemic Design « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems Thinking and Design is part of the academic programme at NID, it involves the application of the systems approach towards complex issues and wicked problems from socio-cultural-economic-environmental perspective with high level of ambiguity, uncertainty and complexity.
* Alex Ryan is leading a group of systemic designers at the '''Government of Alberta.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-overlap/the-alberta-colab-story-2d409ecf747c|title=The Alberta CoLab Story|first=Alex|last=Ryan|date=3 April 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They combine systemic design and strategic foresight to redesign the policy development process in government.

==History==
=== From complexity theories to systemic design ===

The theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, on the basis of the '''General Systems Theory''' by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968).&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, K.L. (1968) General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also '''productive models with their organizations and management''', where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Pisek, P.E. and Wilson, T. (2001) Complexity, Leadership, And Management In Healthcare Organizations, British Medical Journal, Vol.323, pp.746-749.&lt;/ref&gt;). In that field, '''Cluster Theory''' (Porter, 1990 &lt;ref&gt;Porter, M.E. (1990) Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like '''Industrial Ecology''' (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 &lt;ref&gt;Frosh, R.A. and Gallopoulos, N.E. (1989) Strategies for Manufacturing, Scientific American, Vol.3 No.189, pp.94-102.
&lt;/ref&gt;) and '''Industrial Symbiosis''' (Chertow, 2000 &lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M.R. (2000) Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and Environment, Vol.25, pp.313-337&lt;/ref&gt;). 
In 1994, '''Gunter Pauli''' and '''Heitor Gurgulino de Souza''' founded the research institute '''Zero Emission Research and Initiatives''' (ZERI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeri.org/|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.zeri.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem.
The '''design thinking''', as Buchanan (1992) said,&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, R. (1992) Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, Design Issues, Vol.8 No.2, pp.5-21.&lt;/ref&gt; means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 &lt;ref&gt;Fuller R.B. (1981), Critical Path, St. Martin’s Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 &lt;ref&gt;Chertow, M. R., Ashton, W. and Kuppali, R. (2004) The Industrial Symbiosis Research Symposium at Yale: Advancing the Study of Industry and Environment, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a '''human-centred systems-oriented design practice''' (Bistagnino, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Bistagnino, L. (2011) Systemic Design: Designing the productive and environmental sustainability, 2nd ed., Slow Food, Bra.&lt;/ref&gt; Sevaldson, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Sevaldson, B. (2011). Gigamapping: Visualization for complexity and systems thinking in design. Proceedings of the Nordic Design Research Conference. Aalto University, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson and Stolterman, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, H.G. and Stolterman, E. (2012). The design way: Intentional change in an unpredictable world, 2nd ed., MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P.H. (2014) ‘Systemic Design Principles for Complex Social Systems’, in Metcalf, G.S. (Eds.), Social Systems and Design, Springer Verlag, Berlin, pp.91-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Toso at al., 2012 &lt;ref&gt;Toso D., Barbero S., Tamborrini P. (2012) Systemic Design: Beyond Ecodesign. Proceedings of the 18th Annual International Sustainable Development Research Conference, University of Hull, UK&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Systemic design today ===

The contemporary debate on Systemic design started with the '''Relating Systems Thinking and Design Symposia series''' (RSD)  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://systemic-design.net/rsd-symposia/|title=RSD Proceedings « Systemic Design|author=|date=|website=systemic-design.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the initiative of Birger Sevaldson at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in 2012. Amongst the invited participants were Harold Nelson, Peter H. Jones and Alex Ryan. An initial meeting was held in Oslo to consolidate the possibility of building a future network. Other participants were Michael Hensel, Colleen Ponto and others. The RSD seminars started in the context of Systems Oriented Design (SOD). In 2013-14 a discussion was initiated by Birger Sevaldson questioning the framework of the new emerging network. The network changed its name to Systemic Design allowing it to grow more pluralistically while SOD could develop more specially. The Systemic Design Research Network was founded shortly after on the initiative of Peter H. Jones and with Harold Nelson, Alex Ryan and Birger Sevaldson as co-founders.&lt;ref name="systemic-design.net"/&gt;

==Background==
Systems thinking in design has a long history with people like Christpher Alexander, Horst Rittel,  Russl Ackoff, Bela Banathy, Ranulph Glanville, M.P.Ranjan, Harold Nelson and others. Also the main systems theories and models were known and applied in design since their beginning. Despite this Systems Thinking has never become mainstream in design. The reasons for this might be that the prescribed techniques and approaches were too technical and did not fit well to an organic design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/4645-feature-article-learning-the-lessons-of-systems-thinking-exploring-the-gap-between-thinking-and-leadership/|title=Feature Article: Learning the Lessons of Systems Thinking: Exploring the Gap between Thinking and Leadership - Integral Leadership Review|author=|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systemic design initiative is addressing this problem by seeking new connections and relations between systems thinking and designerly ways of working.

'''''The Captive Slave''''' is a portrait painted by the artist [[John Simpson (artist)|John Simpson]] (1782–1847), which was first exhibited in London in 1827.  It shows a man, manacled, on a stone bench and looking pensively or plaintively upward.  Its subject matter, historical period, and mode of creation suggest the artist intended the painting as a statement against slavery.  Until acquired by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 2008, it had not been displayed to the public for 180 years.

==Simpson's painting==
The three-quarter portrait shows a dark-skinned man in orange-red open collar clothing, sitting on a stone bench, against a muted background, with the sitter taking up most the frame. Large metallic manacles are visible around his wrists, which lie on his lap, and a heavy chain falls across the bench and out of the frame.  The man is gazing up and to his left.&lt;ref name="Postle"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Postle |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Postle |date=Spring 2009 |title=''The Captive Slave'' by John Simpson (1782–1847): A rediscovered masterpiece |jstor=41614836 |journal=The British Art Journal |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=18–26 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AIC&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/193664 | title=About This Artwork: ''The Captive Slave'' | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

At its original showing it was entitled, ''The Captive Slave,'' and the viewer is informed of the sitter's condition as a slave by the manacles and by his dark skin, which connects him to the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]].&lt;ref name=Lugo&gt;{{cite book | title=Slave Portraiture in the Atlantic World | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Agnes Lugo-Ortiz and Angela Rosenthal, editors | year=2013 | pages=17–18 | isbn=9781107004399}}&lt;/ref&gt; His clothes suggest somewhat foreign origin but also prison garb. The features of the subject show the man as a recognizable individual person. The painting is described as a [[portrait]] but also a hybrid with [[genre art|genre painting]], as the name of the character in the painting is unknown.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lugo/&gt;  His aspect is saintly&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt; or heroic,&lt;ref name=AIC/&gt; imploring, vulnerable, and somewhat passive in rest, which allowed the British viewer when the portrait was shown to safely sympathize or pity the subject and deplore his condition.&lt;ref name=Lugo/&gt; While the portrait follows high art conventions for depicting the saintly or long suffering, portraits of individual slaves were rare in the European high art tradition.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;

==Artist and artwork==

The artist, John Simpson, was a British portrait painter, who studied at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academies]], and was a longtime assistant of  the portraitist [[Thomas Lawrence]].  Today, Simpson is described as "little known".&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;  The painting was created on a used canvas that x-rays show had previously depicted a stately home and another portrait; this reuse suggests that the artist did not paint it on commission, which is how he made his living, but here he appears to have chosen the subject of his own volition.  The portrait was displayed in London at the Royal Academy not once but twice, in 1827 and again in 1828; it was also displayed at an exhibition at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]] in 1828.  

In this period, Britain was debating whether to abolish slavery throughout its empire. The British slave trade had been outlawed in 1807, but [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] was still a pressing political question in the late 1820s. Against this background, the two London showings and the showing in Liverpool, "a city synonymous with the slave trade, and whose merchants continued to prosper from [slavery]"&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt; is seen as significant.  The artist included lines of [[William Cowper]]' poetry in the first exhibition catalogue: "Ah but! what wish can prosper or what prayer/for merchants rich in cargoes of despair" (from the poem, ''Charity'', 1784). Reviewer [[Martin Postle]] concludes:{{quote|Despite enduring critical neglect and eventual obscurity, Simpson was a gifted artist, capable at times of venturing beyond the parameters of society portraiture and his position as a studio assistant. And in one particular work, ''The Captive Slave'', John Simpson produced a painting of iconic status, which can be regarded today as his masterpiece and as a worthy emblem of the aims and achievements of the Abolition Movement.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;}}

The model for the painting is thought to be the American-born actor [[Ira Aldridge]].&lt;ref name=AIC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/simpson-head-of-a-man-ira-frederick-aldridge-n00382/text-summary | title=John Simpson, Head of a Man (?Ira Frederick Aldridge) exhibited 1827 | publisher=[[Tate Britain]] | date=September 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Myrone, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aldridge was born a [[free negro]] and educated in New York City, he left America because of the lack of serious acting opportunities there for a black man.  He went on to become a successful Shakespearean actor in Europe, despite sometimes racist comments from theater critics.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;

==Provenance==
Simpson's painting was sold in [[Dublin]] from a private collection in 1996, at the time a label on the frame read "J. Simpson, ''The Slave''".  A private British collector later sold it to an art dealer, who sold it to the Art Institute of Chicago in 2008.  Prior to the acquisition by the museum where it underwent scientific testing, the painting had not been displayed to the general public for 180 years.&lt;ref name="Postle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Artic&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=cache:FZWOFVxF1GIJ:http://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/press_pdf/Captive_Slave_acquis.pdf%2Bhttp://www.artic.edu/sites/default/files/press.../Captive_Slave_acquis.pd&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;&amp;ct=clnk | title=Art Institute Announces Major Acquisition of Landmark British Painting,  Simpson's Rediscovered Captive Slave Bold Anti-Slavery Statement - First Public Exhibition of Work in 180 Years | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | date=2008 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What is now considered to be a copy from an unknown hand is in the collection of the [[Wilberforce House]] museum in Hull, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/255007.html |title=The Captive Slave - National Maritime Museum |website=Royal Museums Greenwich |access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The evening of Ashura''' ({{lang-fa|عصر عاشورا}}) is a painting by [[Mahmoud Farshchian]]. The central motif is sadness and sorrow of [[Husayn ibn Ali]]’s family while crying around his horse coming back without its rider. Husayn ibn Ali was killed in [[battle of Karbala]]. Farshchian dedicated his work to museum of [[Astan Quds Razavi]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/4639213/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%86%DA%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%B4%D8%AF | title=How Mahmoud Farshchian's painting about the evening of Ashura is developed? | publisher=YJC | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Mahmoud Farshchian}}
Mahmoud Farshchian (born January 24, 1930) is a [[Persian art| Persian painter]] and [[Persian miniature|miniaturist]]. He was born in the city of [[Isfahan]] and started to learn art, painting and sculpting. His works have been hosted by several museums and exhibitions worldwide. He is the most modernizer of the field of miniatures, an art form which was first established in [[Ancient Persia]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Turkey]] and other Middle Eastern countries. In addition, the design of the [[Zarih]], roof, door and cellar in the shrine of [[Ali al-Ridha]], the 8th [[Shia Imam]], in [[Mashhad]] and his membership in the committee supervising the construction of the shrine, is among work of him.&lt;ref name="Farshchian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=934&amp;articleID=509616 | title=Biography of Mahmoud Farshchian | publisher=Tebyan | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title and subject ==
The Evening of Ashura is about the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in [[battle of Karbala]] who is unseen in the illustration and his horse is depicted returning to the tents alone, highlighting his martyrdom. There are women and young girls who are crying their hearts out at the feet of the charger which is back from the battle without bringing its rider back. There is an untidy saddle with pigeons hit by arrows falling on the saddle.&lt;ref name="resistart"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Mojdeh | last1=Morad Ganjeh | url=http://resistart.ir/content/%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B4%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86/ | title=Analyzing into the evening of Ashura, work of Master Farshchian | publisher=Resistart | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranreview"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Shahram | last1=Za’feranlou | url=http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Analysis-of-The-Evening-of-Ashura-Painting.htm | title=Analysis of “The Evening of Ashura” Painting | publisher=Iranreview | accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Feast of the Gods''''' (Italian: ''Il festino degli dei'') is an [[oil painting]] by the Italian Renaissance master [[Giovanni Bellini]], with substantial additions to the landscape in stages by [[Dosso Dossi]] and [[Titian]], who added all the landscape to the left and centre. It is one of the few mythological pictures by the Venetian artist.  Completed in 1514, it was his last major work. It is now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C., which calls it "one of the greatest Renaissance paintings in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1138.html?opensection=inscription NGA "Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is the first major depiction of the subject of the "[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]" in Renaissance art, which was to remain in currency until the end of [[Northern Mannerism]] over a century later.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 342–43&lt;/ref&gt; It has several similarities to another, much less sophisticated, treatment of the 1490s by the Florentine artist [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]], now in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Giovanni - Noces de Thétis et Pelée, Louvre RF 1346.jpg|Bartolomeo di Giovanni's painting]] in the Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission==
[[File: Giovanni Bellini and Titian - The Feast of the Gods  Detail- Mercury &amp; Chinese porcelain.jpg|thumb|left|This detail of Mercury shows the earliest known depiction of [[Chinese porcelain in European painting]]]]
The painting is signed by an inscription on the fictive paper attached to the wooden tub at lower right: "joannes bellinus venetus / p MDXIIII" ("Giovanni Bellini of Venice, painted 1514"), and his payment that year is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1138.html?opensection=inscription NGA "Inscription"]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a narrative by [[Ovid]],&lt;ref name=Ovid/&gt; it is the earliest of a cycle of paintings, all major works, on mythological subjects produced for [[Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso, I d'Este]], the Duke of [[Ferrara]], for his ''[[Camerini d'alabastro|camerino d'alabastro]]'' ('chamber of alabaster') in the [[Castello Estense]], [[Ferrara]]. The subjects had been chosen by 1511, by the [[Renaissance humanist]] [[Mario Equicola]], then working for the Duke's sister [[Isabella d'Este]], and instructions apparently including some sketches were sent to the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Colantuono, 237–239; Freedman, 42–48&lt;/ref&gt; Later commissions were four large [[Titian]]s (one now lost), and ten smaller works by [[Dosso Dossi]], probably placed above them.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 102&lt;/ref&gt; The three surviving Titians painted for the room are ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]), ''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'' and ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'' (both [[Prado]], Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;All have entries in Jaffé, with 3 of the Dossi's, 101–111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alterations==
It had been suggested that Bellini made a preliminary set of alterations before or soon after 1514 to make the painting more compatible with the original Latin of Ovid, having previously been working from an Italian ''Ovidio volgarizzato'' version, and that at this point Bellini changed most of the characters to gods rather than people from [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], giving them attributes and lower necklines for the women.  But this view was based on a misunderstanding of the early x-rays taken in 1956. It is now thought that the figures are as originally painted by Bellini.&lt;ref&gt;Colantuono, 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; Bellini died in 1516, soon after completing the painting, and some years later Dosso Dossi and perhaps [[Titian]] modified the landscape on the left to match it to his [[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]] (1518–1523), also in Alfonso's Camerino, adding the rocky hill behind the figures and the brighter foliage on a tree at the right.  A more thorough reworking by Titian in about 1529 added more landscape, overpainting the earlier changes.  But all the work on the figures remains Bellini's.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 108; Bull, 242; [http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1138.html?opensection=inscription NGA "Overview"].  The precise sequence and authorship of the alterations remains the subject of some debate.&lt;/ref&gt; A pheasant in a tree on the right, above Priapus, may have been painted by Alfonso himself, an amateur painter.&lt;ref name="NGA Explore"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight1138.html NGA "Explore"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
[[File:Giovanni Bellini and Titian - The Feast of the Gods - Detail- figures right &amp; tub with script.jpg|thumb|Priapus and Lotis]]

The painting shows the incident of the attempted rape of [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]].  She was a [[nymph]] mentioned by [[Ovid]], the daughter of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] or [[Nereus]]. During a festival in honor of [[Liber]] that she attended, [[Priapus]] tried to rape her while she was asleep, but she was awakened by a sudden cry of [[Silenus]]'s ass and ran off, leaving Priapus in embarrassment as everyone else woke up too and became aware of his intentions.&lt;ref name=Ovid&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', 1. 391 of; Bull, 242&lt;/ref&gt; The story is shown at the edges of the composition, in a somewhat undramatic fashion presumably showing a moment shortly before the key incident, with Silenus and his ass at left and Priapus and Lotis at right (and everyone but Lotis still wide awake).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 282&lt;/ref&gt; The subject had been depicted in the first illustrated edition of ''Ovid'' in Italian, published in [[Venice]] in 1497. Another depiction of this rare subject in a Venetian print of 1510 has a very similar pose for Lotis but places much greater emphasis on the erotic nature of the story, including Priapus's outsize penis, here only a hint under the drapery.&lt;ref&gt;Spangenberg, 56; the print is an engraving by [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1355967&amp;partId=1 British Museum collection online] (Hind, 7, Museum number 1845,0825.624); Colantuono, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures shown are usually taken to be (left to right): a [[satyr]], Silenus with his ass, his ward [[Bacchus]] as a boy, [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] (or [[Faunus]]), [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] with his [[caduceus]] and helmet, a satyr, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], a nymph serving, [[Cybele]], [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], two standing nymphs, [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Apollo]], Priapus, Lotis.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, 108; Colantuono, 242, prefers Faunus to Silvanus, though sometimes the two were conflated in any case.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the figures may be portraits of people at the Ferrara court, including Alfonso and his wife [[Lucrezia Borgia]].&lt;ref name="NGA Explore"/&gt;

Another suggestion is that the couple in the center, the male with his hand between the female's thighs, are a bridal pair, as shown by their intimacy and the [[quince]] she is holding, a fruit recommended for brides to increase their sexual appetites.&lt;ref&gt;Syson, 252&lt;/ref&gt; If he is still Neptune, this would make her [[Amphitrite]]. 
[[File: Giovanni Bellini and Titian - The Feast of the Gods - Detail- Silenus.jpg|thumb|left|Silenus with his ass and the infant Bacchus]]

==Interpretation==
The work is atypical of Renaissance mythological painting in the down to earth treatment of the main deities, which may be accounted for by the figures beginning as ordinary citizens of Thebes, and by Bellini's inexperience in the emerging conventions of mythological art. The work was a considerable departure from his usual subject-matter of religious scenes and portraits for Bellini, who was over 80 when he began it. He had previously been reluctant to paint mythological stories, wriggling out of a commission from [[Isabella d'Este]], Alfonso's sister, in 1501–04 (she had to be content with a ''Nativity'' at a lower price than she had offered for a ''storia'').  He was perhaps then reluctant to compete with his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna]], who specialized in classical subjects.  But Mantegna had died in 1506.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 284&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first work produced for the ''camerino'', Bellini determined many elements of the style for the cycle, which Titian needed to harmonize with in his later canvases.  The room as a whole "constituted a large novelty in the European imagination", as the paintings "established in visual form the picture of the ideal, mythical Mediterranean idyll, made up of charming people enjoying themselves in a gorgeous landscape" and "presented figures from classical mythology as laymen engaged in lay pursuits of love and war, embodied in the new realistic naturalism which had only just been developed... Secular life came into high art by the back door as the representation of the stories of the classical gods, in whom no one believed, but who, since they were not real gods, could be placed in embarrassing situations.  The pictures in the ''Camerino'' were perhaps the crucial stage in this revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 281 (quoted); Bull, 235–238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later provenance==
The paintings stayed in the room for which they were painted until 1598 when they were confiscated and taken to Rome by Cardinal [[Aldobrandini family|Ippolito Aldobrandini]] ("junior") as [[Papal Legate]]. The group was separated in 1623, and the ''Feast'' left the [[Aldobrandini]] family in 1796–97, passing to the Camuccini family.  The painting left Italy for England in 1853 and was bought by the [[4th Duke of Northumberland]], then sold in 1916 by the [[7th Duke of Northumberland|7th Duke]] to the London dealer [[Thomas Agnew and Sons]]. It was bought in 1922 by the estate of the American magnate [[Peter Arrell Brown Widener|Peter A. B. Widener]] (d. 1915) and in 1942 entered the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with the rest of his collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1138.html?opensection=provenance NGA full provenance]; Jaffé, 101 for 1623 split.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
It was exhibited in 1856 at the [[British Institution]] in London (as ''The Gods feasting on the Fruits of the Earth'').  Since it came to Washington it has travelled to Venice in 1990, London and Madrid in 2003 (reuniting all four large works in the cycle, with three of the Dossi works), and [[Vienna]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1138.html?opensection=history NGA "Exhibition history"]; Jaffé, 101–111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting materials==
The painting was thoroughly investigated in 1985 and an extensive pigment analysis was undertaken in the course of the cleaning and conservation work on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Plesters, J. The Feast of the Gods: Conservation, Examination, and Interpretation. Studies in the History of Art, 40, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; All three painters, Bellini, Dosso and Titian employed the pigments available in that time period such as natural [[ultramarine]], [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[malachite]], [[verdigris]] and [[vermilion]]. The Feast of Gods is one of the few examples of the use of [[orpiment]] and [[realgar]] in the Renaissance oil painting in Italy. The very detailed and extensive scientific investigation of this painting has been made accessible to broader audience on the Internet by WebExhibits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/feast/ Investigating Bellini's Feast of the Gods], WebExhibits&lt;/ref&gt; and also more recently by ColourLex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/bellini-feast-of-the-gods/ Bellini, The Feast of the Gods], ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lightning Field''''' (1977) is a [[land art]] work in [[Catron County, New Mexico]], by sculptor [[Walter De Maria]]. It consists of 400 [[stainless steel]] poles with solid, pointed tips, arranged in a rectangular 1 mile &amp;times; 1 kilometre [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] array.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter de Maria's 'Lightning Field' Encompasses a Vast New Mexican Vista|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/12/AR2009081203304.html|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=12 June 2012|author=Blake Gopnik|date=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was commissioned by [[Dia Art Foundation]], which also maintains the work. De Maria and his assistants—Robert Fosdick and Helen Winkler were the principal associates—scoured California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Texas by truck for over five years before settling on the site, {{convert|11.5|mi|km}} east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]], at an elevation of 7,200 feet above sea level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cornelia Dean (September 21, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/travel/drawn-to-the-lightning.html Drawn to the Lightning] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Set in the middle of an empty plateau, 400 stainless steel poles are placed in the form of a grid. The grid measures 1 mile by 1 kilometer, and the poles are set 220 feet apart from one another. Because the land undulates slightly, the poles - two inches in diameter - vary in height: the shortest is 15 feet and the longest is 26 feet 9 inches.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The poles are several times higher than an average person, and the tops end up on a plane level parallel to the ground regardless of the terrain the pole was erected in.&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; Each steel rod is set in its own concrete footing, three feet deep and one foot in diameter, buried one foot beneath the surface. They are designed to survive winds of up to {{convert|110|mi|km}} an hour.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While the title and form of the work suggest that it is a frequent target for [[lightning]] strikes, they are actually fairly infrequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Pilgrimage to The Lightning Field|url=http://fromthefloor.blogspot.com/2004/07/pilgrimage-to-lightning-field-part-2.html|accessdate=12 June 2012|author=Todd Gibson|date=July 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for maintaining and operating ''The Lightning Field'' is provided in part by an endowment established by Ray A. Graham III and Lannan Foundation, which awarded a [[challenge grant]] in 1996. Support towards the permanent preservation of the undeveloped grasslands surrounding the installation has in the past been provided by Dia's Board of Trustees, the [[State of New Mexico]], De Maria's assistant Helen Winkler Fosdick, and [[Gucci]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaart.org/sites/page/56/1376 ''The Lightning Field'' - Funding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621072217/http://www.diaart.org/sites/page/56/1376 |date=2012-06-21 }} Dia Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gucci.com/cn-en/worldofgucci/articles/dia-foundation Gucci and Dia Art Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818221035/http://www.gucci.com/cn-en/worldofgucci/articles/dia-foundation |date=2012-08-18 }} Gucci.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, the structure as a whole needed reinforcement. To scrape together additional funds of an estimated $400,000 to preserve ''Lightning Field'', [[Larry Gagosian]], whose gallery represents De Maria, and [[Miuccia Prada]] have come together to lead the restoration effort. Work on the ''Lightning Field'' was to begin in early 2013, and the sculpture was to be reopened in June.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (June 7, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/arts/design/lightning-field-restoration-campaign-is-set.html Campaign Aims to Restore Weather-Abused ‘Lightning Field’] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featured in publications==
''The Lightning Field'' featured prominently in the novel ''Blinded by the Light'' by Morgan Hunt. This work might also have influenced the imagery of author [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s epilogue in his book ''Blood Meridian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cormacmccarthy.com/journal/PDFs/Campbell.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227181546/http://www.cormacmccarthy.com/journal/PDFs/Campbell.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2012|title=Walter De Maria's Lightning Field and McCarthy's Enigmatic Epilogue: "Y que clase de lugar es este?"|last=Campbell|first=Christopher D.|publisher=The Cormac McCarthy Journal|accessdate=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also the subject of a 2011 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article by [[Geoff Dyer]] called ''Poles Apart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poles Apart|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/18/110418fa_fact_dyer|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=12 June 2012|author=Geoff Dyer|date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ulin discusses the work as a narrative which "unfolds not as a fixed encounter but rather as something that gets inside us in a more sequential way."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ulin|first=David L.|title=The Lost Art of Reading: Why Books Matter in a Distracted Time|year=2010|publisher=Sasquatch|isbn=9781570616709|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the inspiration for composer John Mackey's piece also entitled The Lightning Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lightning Field|url=https://www.jwpepper.com/Lightning-Field/10516033.item#/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Lightning Field'''s fortieth anniversary was the subject of an essay titled "[https://brooklynrail.org/2017/12/artseen/Walter-De-Maria-and-The-Lightning-Field Walter De Maria and The Lightning Field at Forty: Art as Symbiosis]," by Jason Rosenfeld in the December 2017/January 2018 issue of ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]''.

==Visiting==
Open for only six months out of the year, the installation can only be visited by making an advance reservation for an overnight stay in the simple accommodations at the site. Trips to the site consist of a long drive from a scheduled meeting place to a log cabin in the area. The installation is intended to be viewed in isolation or with a very small group of people, so the cabin on the site, in serious disrepair when the project began, was restored to accommodate six people at most. There are two bathrooms, a kitchen and a common room. Camping is not permitted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''''The World's Most Extraordinary Homes''''' is a British [[documentary]] [[miniseries]] presented by [[Caroline Quentin]] and [[Piers Taylor]] and is broadcast on [[BBC Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mangan|first1=Lucy|title=The World’s Most Extraordinary Homes review – Grand Designs on a grander scale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/07/the-worlds-most-extraordinary-homes-review-grand-designs-on-a-grander-scale|website=the Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en|date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The documentary miniseries follows "award-winning architect Piers Taylor and actress and property enthusiast Caroline Quentin explore a range of incredible architect-designed houses in extreme locations around the world. Whether built into the side of a cliff, nestled in a forest, perched at the top of a mountain or hidden under the earth, these homes connect to their environments in a spectacular way. Each episode is themed according to the houses environments — Coast, Forest, Mountain and Underground — with Piers and Caroline traveling to locations ranging from North America to Australasia and Europe. To explore how these dramatic designs function both as works of architecture and as real houses, they stay overnight, eat meals and spend time in the homes."&lt;ref name="flixable"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Most Extraordinary Homes (2017) - Netflix {{!}} Flixable|url=https://flixable.com/title/80213025/|website=flixable.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WBITVP Finished Catalogue 2017|url=https://wbproductions.box.com/shared/static/skntuwfpldn045wc41hxwlzqnwvddgla.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Yes Men''' are a [[culture jamming]] activist duo and network of supporters created by [[Jacques Servin]] and [[Igor Vamos]].&lt;ref name="chron.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Douglas |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/6983925.html |title=The Yes Men infiltrate DiverseWorks |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through actions of [[tactical media]],{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the Yes Men primarily aim to raise awareness about problematic social and political issues. To date, the duo have produced three films: ''[[The Yes Men (film)|The Yes Men]]'' (2003), ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'' (2009)&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; and ''[[The Yes Men Are Revolting]]'' (2014). In these films, they impersonate entities that they dislike, a practice that they call "identity correction". The Yes Men operate under the mission statement that lies can expose truth. They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have led to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations.  They espouse the belief that [[corporation]]s and governmental organizations often act in [[dehumanizing]] ways toward the public. Elaborate props are sometimes part of the ruse (e.g. [[The Yes Men#New York Post and SurvivaBall|Survivaball]]), as shown in their 2003 DVD release ''The Yes Men''. The Yes Men have collaborated with other groups of similar interest, including [[Improv Everywhere]], Andrew Boyd and [[Steve Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/ |title=The Yes Men |publisher=The Yes Men |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to Servin, the Yes Men concept initially sprang from their creation of a fake website spoofing the [[World Trade Organization]]. To the surprise of Servin and Vamos, many believed the site to be authentic, and the two were consequently contacted to speak at a conference in Austria. Since this time, the Yes Men have continued performing large-scale hoaxes, in what they describe as a collaborative effort with journalists to help the media tell stories which they believe are important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fay3RNXI8 |title=The Yes Men Fix the World's Andy Bichlbaum on How The Yes Men Got Started |publisher=YouTube |date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yes Men often deploy a satirical approach: they pose as a powerful entity (typically a corporate or government representative or executive) and make ridiculous and shocking comments that caricature the ideological position of the organisation or person. Furthermore, they acknowledge the idea that many corporate or government entities manipulate their ideology using [[Spin (public relations)|spin]]; in response, the Yes Men use this power of spin to their own advantage, and use media outlets to disseminate their personal interpretation of the situation. A sense of humor and shock value is usually employed to make these issues more palatable to the general public and to call greater media attention to stories of interest.&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; Some of these outrageous ideas include the prospect of selling one's vote or a proposition that the poor should consume recycled human waste. On most occasions, little to no shock or outrage is publicly evoked in response to their prank.

On occasion, the Yes Men's phony spokesperson will make announcements that represent fictitious scenarios for the [[anti-globalization movement]] or opponents of [[corporate crime]]. This has often resulted in false news reports, such as those covering the demise of the [[World Trade Organization]], or [[Dow Chemical]] paying compensation to the victims of the [[Bhopal disaster]].

The Yes Men have posed as spokespeople for the WTO, [[McDonald's]], Dow Chemical, and the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. The two leading members of the Yes Men are known by a number of aliases, most recently, and in film, [[Andy Bichlbaum]] and [[Mike Bonanno]] ([[Jacques Servin]]&lt;ref name="simcopter"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-12-08/news/18024496_1_simcopter-helicopter-simulation-game-maxis | title=PIXEL GAIETY COSTS JOB | publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]] | date=1996-12-08 | accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Igor Vamos]], respectively). Servin is an author of experimental fiction, and was known for being the man who inserted images of men kissing in the computer game ''[[SimCopter]]''. Vamos is an associate professor of media arts at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], New York. They are assisted by numerous people across the globe. There are other full-time members, such as Whitney Black and Rocco Ferrer, who take a more behind-the-scenes approach.

Their experiences were documented in the film ''The Yes Men'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379593/ The Yes Men (2003)] IMDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; distributed by United Artists, the film documentary ''[[info wars]]'', and the book ''[[The Yes Men: The True Story of the End of the World Trade Organization]]'' ({{ISBN|0-9729529-9-3}}). Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno also directed a [[2009 in film|2009]] film entitled ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'', which premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theyesmenfixtheworld.com/index.htm |title=NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD - THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD - The new movie that exposes the world of big business and the outrageous pranks that highlight the ways that corporate greed is destroying the planet.

Their third film, ''[[The Yes Men Are Revolting]]'', premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]].

== Projects ==

=== George W. Bush ===
One of the Yes Men's first pranks was the satirical website www.gwbush.com, established for the [[2000 US presidential election]] to draw attention to alleged hypocrisies on Bush's actual website. When asked about the site in a press conference on May 21, 1999, Bush responded that the website had gone too far in criticizing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/29/002r-112999-idx.html |title=Satirical Web Site Poses Political Test |first=Terry M. |last=Neal |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rtmark.com/more/articles/bushdallas0522bush1bushsite.htm | title=Bush criticizes Web site as malicious | publisher=The Dallas Morning News | date=May 22, 1999 | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | last=Slater | first=Wayne | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911165539/http://www.rtmark.com/more/articles/bushdallas0522bush1bushsite.htm | archivedate=September 11, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/bush/ |title=The Yes Men: Bush |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69TEbgvxn?url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bush |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Yes Men went on tour posing as the group "Yes, Bush Can!" and encouraged supporters to sign a "Patriot Pledge" agreeing to keep [[nuclear waste]] in their back yards and send their children off to war. They appeared at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] and drove across the country at first in an RV with a George W. Bush body wrap, and then in a painted van.

==== Ice Age Petition ====
The Yes Men posed as working as part of the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush-Cheney campaign]]. They carried around a petition asking for signatures to support [[global warming]] because America's competing countries will suffer while America only bears minor side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Yes Men on Ice Age Petition |publisher=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_kqsuOxKFY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dow Chemical ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dow apologizes.jpg|left|thumb|Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the Yes Men, appears on [[BBC World]] to take full responsibility for the [[Bhopal disaster]].]] --&gt;

On December 3, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the [[Bhopal disaster]], Andy Bichlbaum appeared on [[BBC World]] as "Jude Finisterra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="The Yes Men Fix the World": In New Film, Anti-Corporate Pranksters the Yes Men Continue to Jolt Polluters and Profiteers|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/23/yes_men|accessdate=2010-12-04|newspaper=Democracy Now!|date=July 23, 2009|first=Mike |last=Bonanno|first2=Andy |last2=Bichlbaum|first3=Juan |last3=Gonzalez|quote= ANDY BICHLBAUM: Well, Jude is the patron saint of the impossible, and there’s absolutely no way a company like Dow will ever do the right thing in Bhopal, unless we force it. And Finisterra, of course, end of the world, end of the earth. It’s just never going to happen. }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiWlvBro9eI |title=YouTube: Bhopal Disaster - BBC - The Yes Men |publisher=BBC World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow is the owner of [[Union Carbide]], the company responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India on December 3, 1984. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately from the hazardous chemicals and thousands more were killed by the plume from the UCC plant during the next few days.&lt;ref name="Fortun"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortun |first=K |title=Advocacy after Bhopal |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas, leading to numerous early and late health defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassells |first=J |title=Sovereign immunity: Law in an unequal world |journal=Social and legal studies |year=1996 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=431–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhopal Disaster became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKenzie |first=D |title=Fresh evidence on Bhopal disaster |journal=New Scientist |year=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the disaster, UCC began attempts to dissociate itself from responsibility for the gas leak.&lt;ref name="Fortun"/&gt; The Indian Supreme Court eventually mediated a settlement in which UCC accepted moral responsibility and agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=S |title=Victims of gas leak in Bhopal seek redress on compensation |journal=BMJ |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7462 |page=366 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7462.366-b |pmid=15310593 |pmc=509368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their fake Dow Chemical website, the Yes Men said that Dow Chemical Company had no intention whatsoever of repairing the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dow Ethics website |url=http://www.dowethics.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real company received considerable backlash, and both the real Dow and the phony Dow denied the statements, but Dow took no real action.

The Yes Men decided to pressure Dow further, so as "Finisterra," Bichlbaum went on the news to claim that Dow planned to liquidate Union Carbide and use the resulting $12 billion to pay for medical care, clean up the site, and fund research into the hazards of other Dow products. After two hours of wide coverage, Dow issued a press release denying the statement, ensuring even greater coverage of the phony news of a cleanup. In Frankfurt, Dow's share price fell 4.24 percent in 23 minutes, wiping $2 billion off its market value. The shares rebounded in Frankfurt after the BBC issued an on-air correction and apology. In New York, Dow Chemical's stock were little changed because of the early trading.&lt;ref name="CNNWorld"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-12-03/world/bhopal.hoax_1_dow-chemical-dow-stock-bhopal?_s=PM:WORLD | title=Bhopal hoax sends Dow stock down | work=CNN.com | date=December 3, 2004 | accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original interview was revealed as a hoax, Bichlbaum appeared in a follow-up interview on the United Kingdom's Channel 4 news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelgum.com/4024557/yes-men-the-legendary-bbc-bhopal-hoax.html |title=Yes Men: The legendary BBC Bhopal Hoax |publisher=Babelgum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607150127/http://www.babelgum.com/4024557/yes-men-the-legendary-bbc-bhopal-hoax.html |archivedate=2010-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interview he was asked if he had considered the emotions and reaction of the people of Bhopal when producing the hoax. According to the interviewer, "there were many people in tears" upon having learned of the hoax. Bichlbaum said that, in comparison, what distress he had caused the people was minimal to that for which Dow was responsible. The Yes Men claim on their website that they have been told by contacts in Bhopal that once they had got over their disappointment that it wasn't real, they were pleased about the stunt and thought it had helped to raise awareness of their plight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyesmen.org/faq#falsehopes |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=The Yes Men |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[International Payments Conference]] on April 28, 2005, 'Dow representative' "Erastus Hamm" unveiled Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable Risk mascot — a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda — to an audience of about 70 banking professionals.

In February 2012, it was widely reported in the [[2012 Stratfor email leak]] that Dow Chemical Company hired private intelligence firm [[Stratfor]] to monitor the Yes Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stratfor-was-Dows-Bhopal-spy-WikiLeaks/articleshow/12062587.cms |title=Stratfor was Dow’s Bhopal spy: WikiLeaks |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WTO ===
One of the Yes Men's most famous pranks is placing a "corrected" [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] website at http://www.gatt.org/ ([[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]). The fake site began to receive real emails from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite groups on behalf of the WTO, to which they responded as if they were the actual WTO. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Appearing in newly purchased suits, the Yes Men gave speeches encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from citizens. They argued that the US Civil War was a waste of money because Third World countries now willingly supply equivalent slaves. They also urged people to listen to the WTO instead of the facts.  They then unveiled a gold spandex body suit that they claimed would allow productivity to increase, as managers would not have to oversee workers in person but could keep track of them via images on an attached screen as well as implanted sensors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== New Orleans and HUD ===
{{Wikinews|HUD hoaxer calls attention to lack of affordable housing}}
The Yes Men appeared on August 28, 2006 at a "Housing Summit" in New Orleans, taking the stage along with New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] and Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]]. Before an audience composed mostly of real estate developers, one of the Yes Men gave a speech in which he claimed to be Rene Oswin, a fictitious "assistant under-secretary" at the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).  In his speech he claimed that HUD would reopen public housing facilities that had been closed since [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck in August 2005.  He announced this false claim because HUD had recently decided to only rebuild a third of the subsidized housing stock after hurricane Katrina, and made plans to demolish four of New Orleans’ ten public housing developments, leaving thousands of New Orleans residents without homes. This decision was contested locally, nationally, and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luft |first=Rachel E. |title=Looking For Common Ground: Relief Work In Post-Katrina New Orleans As An American Parable Of Race And Gender Violence |journal=NWSA Journal |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=5–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, the Yes Men proclaimed that HUD had changed its mind about tearing down the undamaged housing units, and would not tear down the housing projects, as they had planned to do in order to replace them with mixed-income developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Oops: Impostor scams Louisiana officials |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/28/hud.hoax/index.html |date=2006-08-28 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HUD has called this prank, which brought attention to the lack of affordable housing,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} a "cruel hoax." A former resident of the community was quoted by Bichlbaum as saying, "do whatever's most effective, do it, don't worry about how it affects us," however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/08/29/yes_men |title=The HUD Hoax |first=Alex |last=Koppelman |publisher=Salon |date=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUD spokeswoman Donna White said no one named "Rene Oswin" works for the department. White commented, "I'm like, who the heck is that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2006/08/fake_hud_official_punkd_louisi.php | title=Fake HUD Official Punk'd Louisiana Pols | work=TPM Muckraker | date=August 28, 2006 | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | last=Rood | first=Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictitious Oswin also announced that the big oil companies would contribute some of their record profits to rebuild the wetlands destroyed by the construction of oil tanker canals to prevent the city from being inundated by future hurricanes.

=== ExxonMobil ===
[[Image:The Yes Men.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Bichlbaum]] and [[Mike Bonanno]] pose as [[ExxonMobil]] executives.]]
On June 14, 2007, the Yes Men acted during [[Canada]]'s largest oil conference in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], posing as [[ExxonMobil]] and [[National Petroleum Council (US)|National Petroleum Council]] (NPC) representatives. In front of more than 300 oilmen, the NPC was expected to deliver the long-awaited conclusions of a study commissioned by [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Energy Secretary]] [[Samuel Bodman]]. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO [[Lee Raymond]], who is also the chair of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's At Stake? Don't Let Exxon Decide Our Energy future! |url=http://ga3.org/campaign/lee_raymond/explanation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102073241/http://ga3.org/campaign/lee_raymond/explanation |archivedate=2006-11-02 |publisher=The Exxpose Exxon campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Yes Men arrived at the conference they said that [[Lee Raymond]] (the promised speaker) was unable to make it due to a pressing situation with the president. The Yes Men then went on to give a presentation in place of Lee Raymond.

In the actual speech, the "NPC rep" announced that current U.S. and Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive processing of [[Alberta's oil sands]], and the development of [[liquid coal]]) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he reassured the audience that in the worst-case scenario, the oil industry could "keep fuel flowing" by transforming the billions of people who would die into oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0706/S00281.htm |title=Exxon Proposes Burning Humanity for Fuel |publisher=The Yes Men |date=June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, called '''Vivoleum''', would work in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production. The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit "commemorative candles". At this point, event security recognized the Yes Men and forced them off stage, and the 'punchline' — that the candles were made of Vivoleum obtained from the flesh of an "Exxon janitor" who died as a result of cleaning up a toxic spill — was not delivered to the audience, but only to reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070615.RTICKERMN15/TPStory/ |title=Pranksters disrupt oil patch conference |first=Norvall |last=Scott |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822190312/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070615.RTICKERMN15/TPStory/ |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milton Friedman documentary ===
In July 2007, in order to obtain interviews with right wing think tanks, the Yes Men pretended to be filming a documentary about [[Milton Friedman]]. (In fact, their documentary, ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'', did end up speaking about Friedman at length.) After interviewing members of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], several of whom appear in the film, the Yes Men were foiled at the [[Cato Institute]] by libertarian activists [[Bureaucrash]], one of whose members had been hanging around the Competitive Enterprise Institute two days before and recognized the duo. On their way out, Bureaucrash members threw colored powder at the Yes Men in a reference to the rainbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pranks.com/2007/07/14/cato-institute-kos-yes-men-attempt/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023215659/http://pranks.com/2007/07/14/cato-institute-kos-yes-men-attempt/|archivedate=October 23, 2007|title=Just Say No to the Yes Men|date=July 13, 2007|first=Richard |last=Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BP ===
On March 10, 2008, the Yes Men responded to a letter from [[BP]] (merged from British Petroleum and [[Amoco]]) accusing them of [[copyright violation]], with a letter apologizing for having forgotten BP with the spoof site half-completed and that "BP does every bit as much damage to this planet as does Exxon, [[Halliburton]], or any other more obviously nefarious company" and deserves its own properly completed spoof site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/agribusiness/beyondpetrol/|title=Apology to BP|last=Bichlbaum|first=Andy|date=March 10, 2008|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=June 8, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608114230/http://theyesmen.org/agribusiness/beyondpetrol/|archivedate=June 8, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captain Euro ===
In 1999, the Yes Men visited the offices of [[Corporate Vision Strategists|Twelve Star Communications]], creators of the [[Europhile|Eurofederalist]] superhero [[Captain Euro]], "a comic book character designed to promote European unification with young children." Inside, the impostors discover the hidden, dark truth about European Unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/euro|title=Making Europe Fun and Interesting|year=2000|accessdate=April 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324195156/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/euro|archivedate=March 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New York Times'' ===
The Yes Men (along with the Anti-Advertising Agency) also claimed partial responsibility for a prank on November 12, 2008, where approximately 80,000 copies of a fake edition of the July 4, 2009 edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' were handed out on the streets of New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Lambert |url=http://fillip.ca/content/best-case-scenario |title=Fillip / Best Case Scenario |publisher=Fillip.ca |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobnik |first=Verena |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-11-12-new-york-times_N.htm |title='New York Times' spoof circulated |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fake edition shows their ideas for a better future with headlines such as ''Iraq War Ends'' and ''Nation Sets Its Sights on Building Sane Economy''.

[[Alex Jones (journalist)|Alex S. Jones]], a former ''Times'' reporter and media scholar, said of the paper, "I would say if you’ve got one, hold on to it...it will probably be a collector’s item. I’m just glad someone thinks ''The New York Times'' print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax. A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier. But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations? That takes a lot of effort."&lt;ref name="sewell"/&gt;

=== ''New York Post'' and SurvivaBall ===
On September 21, 2009, one day before a UN summit lead-up to the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]], over 2,000 volunteers distributed throughout New York City a 32-page "special edition" ''[[New York Post]]'', blaring headlines (cover story "We're Screwed") that the city could face deadly heat waves, extreme flooding, and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades. The paper had been created by the Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake-up call to action on climate change.  Other articles describe the Pentagon's alarmed response to [[global warming]], the U.S. government's minuscule response, China's advanced alternative energy program, and how the [[COP15]] in Copenhagen could be a "Flopenhagen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6676567 "SPECIAL EDITION" NEW YORK POST] by the Yes Men&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a fake website.&lt;ref&gt;http://nypost-se.com/ "WE'RE SCREWED" climate change special edition New York Post online edition September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A "climate change horoscope" satire on the Sally Brompton horoscope in the Post was commissioned from an environmental activist horoscope writer but was not published.

On September 22, 2009 the Yes Men demonstrated on the alleged behalf of [[Halliburton]] and dozens of other climate threatening corporations an inflatable ball-shaped costume known as the SurvivaBall, claiming it was a self-contained living system for surviving disasters caused by global warming. Over two dozen people wore the SurvivaBall costumes as it was demonstrated in the East River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelgum.com/4005324/balls-across-america.html |title=Balls Across America |publisher=Babelgum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811210656/http://www.babelgum.com/4005324/balls-across-america.html |archivedate=2010-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police shut down the demonstration for lack of a permit. Co-founder of the Yes Men, Andy Bichlbaum, was arrested on an outstanding parking ticket charge and a handful of other Yes Men were served with summons and tickets for disorderly behavior and creating hazardous conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The SurvivaBall was also used in a protest at the steps of the capitol. The protesting balls demanded action be taken on global warming to achieve the [[350.org]] goal. Their strategy was to block the entrance until the government comes to a binding agreement on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/survivaball Survivaball] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324234513/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/survivaball |date=2013-03-24 }} from TheYesMen.org, retrieved 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Chamber of Commerce ===
On October 19, 2009, the Yes Men spoofed the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], declaring a U-turn on their climate change policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/19/chamber-commerce-climate-hoax|title=US Chamber of Commerce falls victim to 'fraud' over climate hoax|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne |date=19 October 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-10-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYGcIhNGSIY |title=Will the real chamber of Commerce please stand up? |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yes Men were not able to complete the conference without being exposed as a hoax, although their message that the United States Chamber of Commerce needs to reevaluate their direction in terms of clean energy was their primary concern and was received. Major TV and news organisations carried this story briefly before the hoax was uncovered. The US Chamber of Commerce two weeks later did change their official policy though, according to [[Al Gore]] it was "not because of" the Yes Men's stunt. The Chamber launched a trademark and copyright infringement lawsuit against The Yes Men, who were defended by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The suit was dropped in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grist.org/news/yes-men-prank-the-chamber-of-commerce-and-get-away-with-it | publisher=Grist | title=Yes Men prank the Chamber of Commerce — and get away with it|last=Upton|first=John|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/202401/chamber-of-commerce-drops-lawsuit-against-parodist.html |publisher=Online Media Daily| title=Chamber Of Commerce Drops Lawsuit Against Parodists|last=Davis|first=Wendy|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action appears in their film, ''The Yes Men Are Revolting''.

=== Canadian environment minister ===
During the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Copenhagen]], the Yes Men put out a statement in which they purported to be the Canadian environment minister, [[Jim Prentice]]. The statement pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The statement was followed by a response from the Ugandan delegation, praising the statement, that was also faked. Another fake statement was then put out blasting the falsehoods of the original fake statement. A fake story in a European edition of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' was also posted online. Jim Prentice described the hoax as "undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/dec/14/environment-canada-spoof|title=Copenhagen spoof shames Canada on the truth about its emissions|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne |date=December 14, 2009 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=December 14, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babelgum.com/4021000/yes-men-canada-takes-stand-climate-change-not.html|title=Yes Men: Canada Takes Stand on Climate Change.

=== Niger Delta Hoax ===
On March 28, 2010, a video was released on [[YouTube]] with the title "Shell: We are sorry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zciWUOrIUqo|title=Shell: We are sorry|date=28 March 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A man called Bradford Houppe, from the Ethical Affairs Committee at [[Royal Dutch Shell]] gave a four-minute-long apology to the people of the [[Niger Delta]] for ruining their land, water, and communities.
This video was created in response to the numerous environmental problems and human rights violations that have occurred in the Niger Delta region of [[Nigeria]] since Shell began oil exploration in the region decades ago. Shell has yet to make any official statement about this video.

=== GE Tax Refund Hoax reported by the AP ===

On April 13, 2011, a hoax website with a [[URL]] similar to that of the [[GE]] press domain (genewscenter.com) designed to look like the GE news center website. The hoax site posted the claim "GE Responds to Public Outcry – Will Donate Entire $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to Help Offset Cuts and Save American Jobs." and it seems that the [[Associated Press|AP]] reported the story as fact, as reported by [[Good (magazine)|''Good'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Shell Oil and ArcticReady.com ===

In June 2012, the Yes Men collaborated with [[Greenpeace]] and members of the [[Occupy Seattle]] movement to create ArcticReady.com, a parody website criticizing Shell Oil's drilling activities in the arctic circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/blog/shellfail-inside-story-greenpeace-yes-men/blog/40876/
|title=Greenpeace, the Yes Men and the inside story of #ShellFail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website launch was commemorated by a fake launch party held in the [[Seattle Space Needle]]. Shell Oil disavowed any affiliation with the website or the launch party on June 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Action Switchboard ===

The Action Switchboard is a platform the Yes Men launched to link up people who want to be involved in activism events with people organising them. As it says&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://actionswitchboard.net/about-action-switchboard|title=About the Action Switchboard|work=Action Switchboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Action Switchboard is a platform that helps activists find each other, come up with direct action ideas, and get the resources they need to pull them off."

=== VW/Dieselgate apology ===
In November 2018, Motherboard/Vice released a video about The Yes Men and their fake VW "Emissions Anonymous" project. In the prank, they apologize to the public for the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|Dieselgate emissions scandal]], in which several models and years of VW car family diesel autos were engineered and built with a rigged emissions system that ran clean only while under test conditions, but otherwise released high levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Motherboard|title=Faking Volkswagen's Dieselgate Apology with the Yes Men|date=2018-11-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-7631xaJQ|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houston Chronicle even covered the pranksters' April 2018 entry in Houston's annual [[Houston Art Car Parade|Art Car Parade]] as if an official VW PR campaign: "The marketing department has even turned the crisis into a publicity shtick".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/columnists/tomlinson/article/Response-to-VW-diesel-emissions-scandal-will-12888576.php|title=Response to VW diesel emissions scandal will define former CEO|date=2018-05-07|work=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
