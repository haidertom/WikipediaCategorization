The '''Research School of Physics and Engineering''' (RSPE) was established with the creation of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) in 1947. Located at the ANU's main campus in [[Canberra]], the school is one of the four founding research schools in the ANU's [[Australian National University#The Institute of Advanced Studies|Institute of Advanced Studies]].

As part of the Institute of Advanced Studies it is primarily a research school with limited interaction with the ANU's undergraduate students. With a total of around 200 employees the school has approximately 60 PhD students and 70 academic staff. The school is divided into separate research departments although PhD students can often be based in more than one department.&lt;ref name=webpage&gt;{{cite web

==Research==
RSPE is one of the leading physics research institutions in Australia. Major research facilities at the school include the '''[[14UD]]''' [[NEC]] [[Pelletron]] [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]] and associated modular [[superconducting]] [[linac]] run by the Department of Nuclear Physics, the [[H-1NF]] flexible [[Stellarator]] [[Heliac]] run by the Plasma Research Laboratory plus an extensive range of smaller experimental and computational equipment. 

Research ranges from the fundamental to the applied, including both experimental and theoretical work. The school's primary research areas are: materials science and engineering; lasers, nonlinear optics and photonics; nanotechnology and mesoscopic physics; physics of atoms, molecules and the nucleus; plasma physics and surface science; physics and the environment.&lt;ref name=webpage/&gt;

The nuclear physics 14UD is one of a handful of large [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]] accelerators in the world. It was the largest machine of its type when installed in 1974. After many upgrades the 14UD is capable of running terminal voltage of up 16.7 MV. Charging is via three inductive charging chains. In 1996 a superconducting RF linac was installed that is used as an energy booster for the 14UD enabling higher energies to be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Homopolar anu-MJC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the RSPhysSE 500MJ homopolar generator]]
[[Image:2mv accelerator-MJC01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2 MeV "High Voltage" Van de Graaff linear accelerator built in 1960]]
[[Mark Oliphant|Sir Mark Oliphant]] was the founder of the School and its first Director from 1950 to 1963. The school was originally called the "Research School of Physical Sciences" with "Engineering" being added to its title in 1990 to highlight the large amount of engineering work that is undertaken in the school. The name was again changed in 2008 to the "Research School of Physics and Engineering" to coincide with the merger with ANU's undergraduate physics teaching department.

For much of the early years the focus of a large part of the school was designing, re-designing and building a cyclo-synchrotron that in its final intended form was to produce a beam of 10.6 [[GeV]] protons for nuclear physics research. Designed to be a world class research machine it was referred to within the school as "The Big Machine". Due to shifting goalposts and huge costs the cyclo-synchrotron was never completed. The small 7.7 [[MeV]] [[cyclotron]] designed to function as the proton injector was completed in 1955, and the large [[homopolar generator]] intended to power the system was first operated in 1962, but by this time work on "The Big Machine" itself had been abandoned.

The homopolar generator, the largest ever built, was capable of supplying [[Current (electricity)|currents]] of over 2 [[megaampere]]s. Even though it was never used for its intended purpose it ended up being used for numerous research projects requiring an extremely high current source until its disassembly in 1986. One of these projects was the invention and development of the [[railgun]] by John Barber and [[Richard Marshall (physicist)|Richard Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Richard (2001). "Railgunnery: Where Have We Been? Where Are We Going?".  ''IEEE Transactions on Magnetics'', '''37''' (1), 440–444.&lt;/ref&gt;  The school also benefited in an indirect way from the construction of the massive generator, the accumulated engineering experience and techniques where later used to build other research equipment around the school including the Plasma Physics [[H-1NF|H1NF Heliac]]. Some parts of the homopolar generator are now on permanent display on the lawn outside the research school.

The school has been home to many different particle accelerators over the years. The first accelerator installed was a 1.25 MV Cockcroft-Walton known as HT1, this was in use from 1952 until 1967 when it was sold to the [[University of New South Wales]]. A second smaller 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton machine (HT2) was assembled in house using many spare parts acquired for HT1. In 1955 the UK government supplied a 33 MeV electron synchrotron as a gift. It was moved to the [[University of Western Australia]] in 1961. During 1960–1980 a HVEC EN tandem accelerator was used by nuclear physics for light ion research. 1975 saw the school's 14UD accelerator come online, which has since been augmented with a [[superconducting]] [[linear accelerator]].

On 5 July 1960 a fire during the night destroyed much of the eastern end of the Cockcroft Building. The damage included the drawing office, many student's and staff's results and files and the control room for the 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The 600 kV accelerator though only water damaged had to be scrapped. Refurbishment of the burnt out area was completed in September 1961.

Early departments that have now been spun off into research schools of their own include the departments of ''Astronomy'' and ''Geophysics and Geochemistry''. Geophysics and Geochemistry separated into the Research School of Earth Sciences in 1973. [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] became part of the Department of Astronomy in 1957. While part of the school, the Department of Astronomy developed [[Siding Spring Observatory]] and installed many new [[telescope]]s at [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]. It separated into the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">'''Aaron ben Gershon Abu Al-Rabi''' of [[Catania]] (also '''Aaron ben Gershon Abualrabi''', '''Aaron Alrabi'''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Aronne Abulrabi'') was a [[History of the Jews in Sicily|Sicilian-Jewish]] scholar, cabalist, and astrologer of the 15th century.

==Life==
He was a son-in-law of Don Moses Gabbai, an exile from [[Majorca]]. Aaron was the youngest of five brothers, all rabbinic scholars; the others were Shallum, Baruch, Moses, and Isaac. He studied in [[Treviso]], [[Italy]], and was familiar with the scientific and philosophic literature of his age; he was a good grammarian, and well acquainted with the [[Arabic language]]. Like his father, he believed in astrology, and loved to observe the horoscope. He was also an adept in the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]], though at times his critical spirit came in conflict with its doctrines. On his travels he visited [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Damascus]], and [[Feodosiya#Caffa|Kaffa]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. In [[Jerusalem]] he had many disputations with the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], to which his commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] refers with evident pride, as having vindicated the cause of rabbinical theology. While in [[Rome]] he was admitted to the presence of [[Pope Martin V]], who was surrounded by his cardinals. Martin V was kindly disposed toward the [[Jews]], and often discussed religious questions with them in a friendly manner. On this occasion he propounded to Aaron a number of very pointed questions concerning Biblical and Talmudical passages. Among other things he asked if the use of the [[cherubim]] in the Holy of Holies was not rather antagonistic to the [[You shall not make for yourself an idol|Second Commandment]], which prohibits [[idolatry]]. Aaron in his commentary refers several times to this discussion and to the answers he gave.

==Writer==
Coming often in contact with learned Christians, Aaron had many occasions to defend Judaism against the polemics of the Church, on the one hand, and the attacks of the Karaites on the other. It was this unceasing conflict that induced him to write a book, called "Maṭṭeh Aharon" (The Staff of Aaron), in defense of the Law and tradition. Keenly observant, and of an independent and critical spirit, he judged persons and opinions freely and openly. He excels as a writer and as a Bible commentator, and often upbraids the Jews of his native land for their ignorance and hollow pretensions, at the same time pointing with admiration to the numerous Jews of high breeding he has met on his travels. Following the principle of a rational Biblical [[exegesis]], he does not hesitate occasionally to refute [[haggadic]] traditions which seem to conflict with reason and common sense; and at times, like [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Samuel ben Meir]], he even states his disagreement with [[halakic]] interpretation. He was fully conversant with the views of the Karaites and [[Samaritans]] and eager, in his explanation of the Bible, to refute now Christian and now [[Muslim]] doctrines. He boldly exposes errors wherever he finds them, claiming "that it is more honorable for the wise to commit an error than knowingly to misrepresent the truth."

Nor does he shrink from pointing out the blemishes he finds in the character of the Patriarchs. Being guided solely by a love of truth, he, as a matter of course, does not spare such great Bible commentators as [[Rashi]] and [[Nahmanides]]. For the former Aaron entertained a very high regard; of the latter he frequently says, "With due deference to his honor, he misunderstood the Talmud" (see his commentary upon Gen. xxvii. 22; Ex. xxiii. 11, xxv. 9). Like Samuel ben Meir and Maimonides, he explains the law, "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk" (Ex. xxiii. 19), as a warning against a certain idolatrous practise. Notwithstanding his liberal mind and his keen investigating spirit, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries, as may be seen from [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David Abi Zimra's]] mention of him as "Aaron our Rabbi" in No. 10 of his responsa, where he commends him for his liberty of thought. He was a devoted Jew, who deeply deplored the political and social condition of the Jews of his time, and all the more fervently gave expression to his hope for the speedy advent of the Messiah. For his cabalistic views he quotes [[Recanate]] and [[Joseph Sar Shalom]], but not the [[Zohar]].

==Works==
Aaron states that he wrote a [[Hebrew grammar]] entitled "''Ha-Meyasher''" (''The Leveler of the Road''); "''Maṭṭeh Aharon''," referred to above, a cabalistic or metaphysical work; "''Nezer ha-Ḳodesh''" (''The Crown of Holiness''); "''Peraḥ ha-Elohut''" (''The Blossoming of the Godhead''), probably of a similar character, and "''Sefer ha-Nefesh''" (''The Book of the Soul''). All of these works are known only through his own quotations in his supercommentary on Rashi. This work, published from an incomplete manuscript, together with another supercommentary on Rashi by [[Samuel Almosnino]], by [[Moses Albelda]], and by [[Jacob Canizal]], is one of the earliest books printed at Constantinople, and is therefore very rare. According to his own testimony, it was written in 1420 (as Perles has shown); but he intended to compose, or, as Perles thinks, actually did compose, a larger commentary on the Pentateuch. Perles has furnished ample proof that Aaron Aldabi—or, as he called himself, Aaron Alrabi—was a man of great originality and merit, and it is to be hoped that his lost works will be discovered, and that editions of his commentary, based on clear manuscripts existing in Oxford and elsewhere, will fully vindicate his character, though Graetz and Karpeles, in their histories, have attacked him.

J. H. Schorr, in "Zion," 1840, first called attention to Abu al-Rabi, erroneously calling him Aaron ben Mose Alrabi; but, owing to a misunderstanding of his remarks, he ascribes to him the strange assertion that Moses translated the Pentateuch from the Arabic into Hebrew—a misunderstanding repeated by Grätz, "Gesch. d. Juden" (third edition), viii. 250, and by Karpeles, "Gesch. der Jüdischen Literatur," p.&amp;nbsp;771—whereas the author, in his commentary upon Gen. xviii. 5, referring to the rabbinical Haggadah that the angels who came to Abraham appeared as Arabs, says that they spoke in Arabic, and that Moses rendered their words in Hebrew—a remark which he repeats in his comments upon Gen. xxiv. 23 and Ex. ii. 10. Zunz, "Z. G.," pp.&amp;nbsp;518–520, and Steinschneider, "Cat. Bodl.," call him Alrabi. Aaron's true name, however, is given in the acrostic written by him at the end of his published commentary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7961">In [[communication theory]], the '''Allen curve''' is a graphical representation that  reveals the exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the distance between them increases. It was discovered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Professor [[Thomas J. Allen]] in the late 1970s.

A related and highly significant finding of Allen's was his identification of the key role of information gatekeepers. Often such interlocutors were poorly recognized by management and yet conveyed vital concepts from just the right people to just the right other people in the organization.


== Discovery ==

During the late 1970s, Allen undertook a project to determine how the distance between engineers’ offices affects the frequency of technical communication between them. The result of that research produced what is now known as the Allen Curve, revealing a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between work stations. The finding also revealed the critical distance of 50 meters for weekly technical communication.

This finding was originally documented in Allen’s book, ''Managing the Flow of Technology''.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book

== Recent development ==
With the fast advancement of internet and sharp drop of telecommunication cost, some{{who|date=July 2018}} wonder about the application of the Allen Curve in today's corporate environment. In his recently co-authored book, Allen examined this question and the same still holds true. He says&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;{{cite book

:"''For example, rather than finding that the probability of telephone communication increases with distance, as face-to-face probability decays, our data show a decay in the use of '''all''' communication media with distance (following a "near-field" rise).''" [p. 58]

He further explains&lt;ref name="Book2"/&gt;
:"''We do not keep separate sets of people, some of whom we communicate with by one medium and some by another. The more often we see someone face-to-face, the more likely it is that we will also telephone that person or communicate by another medium.''" [p. 58]

== Significance ==

With the wide acknowledgment of importance of communication to innovation, the Allen Curve has been taught and cited in all management literature about innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle''' (20 August 1517{{snd}}21 September 1586), Comte de La Baume Saint Amour, was a Burgundian statesman, made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], who followed his father as a leading minister of the Spanish [[Habsburg]]s, and was one of the most influential European politicians during the time which immediately followed the appearance of [[Protestantism]] in Europe; "the dominating Imperial statesman of the whole century".&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"&gt;Trevor-Roper, Hugh; ''Princes and Artists, Patronage and Ideology at Four Habsburg Courts 1517–1633'', Thames &amp; Hudson, London, 1976, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also a notable [[art collector]], the "greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists".&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in the Free Imperial City of [[Ornans]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06727a.htm Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; now in France, then a self-governing city surrounded by the Imperial territory of the [[Franche-Comté]]. &lt;!-- what??: Due to politics, his birth was recorded 4 days after birth in Besançon. --&gt; His father, [[Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle]] (1484–1550), afterwards became chancellor of the empire under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], held an influential position in the Netherlands, and from 1530 until his death he was one of the emperor's most trusted advisers in Germany. On the completion of his studies in law at [[Padua]] and in divinity at [[Leuven]], Antoine held a canonry at [[Besançon]] in eastern France, then was promoted to the [[bishopric of Arras]] with a dispensation due to his age of barely twenty-three (1540).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Granvella, Antoine Perrenot, Cardinal de|volume=12|pages=361–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained into the priesthood in 1540.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In his episcopal capacity he attended several diets of the empire, as well as the opening meetings of the [[Council of Trent]], which he addressed on behalf of Charles V. The influence of his father, now chancellor, led to Granvelle being entrusted with many difficult and delicate pieces of public business. In the execution of these tasks he developed a talent for diplomacy, while at the same time acquiring an intimate acquaintance with most of the currents of European politics. He was involved in the settlement of the terms of peace after the defeat of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] in 1547, a settlement in which, to say the least, some particularly sharp practice was exhibited. In 1550, he succeeded his father in the office of secretary of state; in this capacity he attended Charles in the war with [[Maurice of Saxony]], accompanied him in the flight from [[Innsbruck]], and afterwards drew up the [[Peace of Passau]] (August 1552).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the following year he and [[Simon Renard]], the ambassador of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] to the Queen [[Mary I of England]], conducted the negotiations for the marriage of [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Philip II of Spain]]. It was to Philip in 1555, on the abdication of the emperor, that Granvelle transferred his services, and by whom he was employed in the Netherlands. In April 1559 Granvelle was one of the Spanish commissioners who arranged the [[Peace of Cateau Cambrésis]], and on Philip's withdrawal from the Netherlands in August of the same year he was  surreptitiously appointed chief councillor to the regent [[Margaret of Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic: A History Vol. 1|last=Motley|first=John|publisher=Harper and Brothers|year=|isbn=|location=New York, New York|publication-date=1883|pages=202, 208–210|quote=|orig-year=Original release 1855|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of repression which in this capacity he pursued during the next five years secured for him many tangible rewards: in 1560 he was elevated to the archepiscopal see of [[Mechelen]], and in 1561 he became a cardinal; but the growing hostility of a people whose religious convictions he had set himself to oppose ultimately made it impossible for him to continue in the Netherlands; and on the advice of his royal master he retired to [[Franche-Comté]] in March 1564.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

After a visit to Rome in 1565; in November 1566 he was appointed as member of the Congregation of "Principi", the centre of the [[Papal States]]' foreign policy, by Pope [[Pius V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enciclopedia dei Papi|last = |first = |publisher = Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana - Treccani|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Rome|pages = |url = http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/santo-pio-v_(Enciclopedia_dei_Papi)/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1570, Granvelle, at the request of Philip, helped to arrange the alliance between the Papacy, Venice and Spain against the Turks, an alliance which was responsible for the victory of [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] the next year. In the same year he became viceroy of [[Naples]], a post of some difficulty and danger, which for five years he occupied with ability and success. He was summoned to [[Madrid]] in 1575 by Philip II to be president of the council for Italian affairs. Among the more delicate negotiations of his later years were those of 1580, which had for their object the ultimate union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, and those of 1584, which resulted in a check to France by the marriage of the Spanish infanta Catherine to [[Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy]]. In the same year he was made [[archbishop of Besançon]], but meanwhile he had been stricken with a lingering disease; he was never enthroned, but died at Madrid in 1586. His body was taken to [[Besançon Cathedral]], where his father had been buried. His tomb  is in [[St. Rumbold's Cathedral|Mechelen cathedral]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Collector of art==
Granvelle had a famous art collection, which partly featured the favourite artists of his Habsburg patrons, such as [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni]], but also included a number of works by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]], as well as a significant collection inherited from his father.  Brueghel's friend, the sculptor [[Jacques Jonghelinck]] (brother of Brueghel's biggest patron) had a studio in Granvelle's palace in Brussels.   Whilst in the Netherlands, he "discovered" [[Antonis Mor]] and introduced him to the Madrid court, and he also patronised [[Giambologna]] and arranged his first visit to Italy.  At his death the collection was inherited by his nephew, who was pressured by [[Rudolf II]], the very acquisitive Austrian Habsburg Emperor, to sell the finest pieces to him, which in 1597 he very reluctantly did, protesting that the price offered for thirty-three works was not enough even for six, and less than he had recently refused from Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Farnese]] for [[Dürer]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand'' alone.  The arrangements were handled by [[Hans von Aachen]].  Most of these pieces are now in Vienna or Madrid, including Titian's ''Venus with an Organ-player'', [[Giambologna]]'s copy of the [[equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius]], tapestries after [[cartoon]]s by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and a bust of Charles V by Leoni.&lt;ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh 1976, p.112"/&gt;

Though he was painted by Titian&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mor, more famous than any portrait of Granvelle himself is the portrait of his dwarf and his mastiff by Mor, now at the [[Musée du Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=obj_view_obj&amp;objet=cartel_8163_10811_p0005735.001.jpg_obj.html&amp;flag=true Louvre On-line Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; which perhaps initiated the Spanish tradition of portraits of court dwarfs. The Flemish [[Renaissance humanist]] [[Justus Lipsius]] was Granvelle's secretary for a period in Rome. He also corresponded with the composers [[Lassus]] and [[Adrian Willaert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3128706|title = Polyphony in the Low Countries|journal = Early Music|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 487–488|last1 = Fitch|first1 = Fabrice|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a magnificent library, some of which remains at Besançon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccfr.bnf.fr/rnbcd_visu/FondetailServlet?num=894 Exposition des livres du cardinal de Granvelle à la Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon, Besançon, 1986: liste dactylographiée des ouvrages exposés.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124181438/http://ccfr.bnf.fr/rnbcd_visu/FondetailServlet?num=894 |date=24 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balseiro Institute teaches [[Physics]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Telecommunications Engineering]] at undergraduate and graduate levels. The institute admits students who have completed two years of university studies (either in Physics or Engineering) and undergoes a rigorous admission procedure.

It's considered the best Experimental Physics and Nuclear Engineering study centre of Latin America, as well as a very prestigious one worldwide. In fact, in 2012 the Balseiro institute was recognized among the best levels of education of the world displacing Princeton, Stanford and Columbia &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitemosmisiones.com/noticias/noticias/instituto-balseiro-bariloche-entre-los-10-mejores-del-mundo/ visitemos Misiones website – “Instituto Balseiro Bariloche entre los 10 mejores del Mundo” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a free public institution with a number of features that make it unique. It was created in 1955 and it was formalized in the agreement signed between the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and the National University of Cuyo (UNCuyo). Its objectives are reflected in the Resolution of the Rectorate 0445 of 1999, where both parties reiterate their willingness to jointly formulate the academic policy of the Balseiro Institute, joining forces in order to contribute jointly to the training of specialists in Sciences and Engineering and renew their objective to contribute to the research and development of activities that meet the interests of the country, through UNIVERSITY and CNEA. At the same time, the Balseiro Institute is an academic unit integrated to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB), which has state-of-the-art research and development laboratories to which IB students have access to practice.
It is noteworthy that all IB students receive full scholarships, allowing them a full dedication to the study. This, among other distinctive aspects, allows students of IB degree, master and postgraduate degrees to gain advanced training in both theoretical aspects as well as laboratory practice and technological innovation.

The students of the Balseiro Institute receive personalized education given the relationship, in quantity and quality, teacher-student. At the same time, these teachers are active researchers and technologists who are continuously linked both to scientific and technological centers and to technology companies in the country and the world. In this way, the acquired experience is transmitted to the students who are formed in a stimulating field of scientific research and technological development of vanguard; Face the challenge of growing professionally in a critical attitude and able to solve novel and highly complex problems. On the other hand, and following the original premise of Dr. José Balseiro, students practice in the first level laboratories of the CAB as an indissoluble part of their respective curricula. The training is completed with various optional subjects and special courses.

Thus, at the high academic level, there is the benefit of having a scholarship, which allows students to develop their career in a full way, with an innovative, inquisitive look and with a view to the challenges in science and technology that the present poses.
At the Balseiro Institute, degrees are given in Physics, Nuclear Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Telecommunications Engineering. It should be noted that the IB is the only institution in the country where Nuclear Engineering is taught at the undergraduate level. Also, they offer masters in Physics, Medical Physics and Engineering and PhDs in Physics, Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Sciences.

Other academic activities include the Specialization Course in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy (CEATEN), as well as the IB-CAB Solid Physics School, Summer Internships, Internship Internships with National and Foreign Universities and Summer Scholarships, Specialization, Workshops, Congresses, Conferences, Colloquia and Workshops.

Since the creation of the Balseiro Institute to date (April 2013) 963 graduates and engineers, 234 masters, 460 doctorates and 112 specialists graduated from CEATEN (Specialization in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy) graduated. Most of these professionals achieved a successful job placement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib.edu.ar/index.php/sobre-el-ib.html Balseiro Institute website – “Sobre el IB” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balseiro Institute works on a permanent basis with the mission of making a substantial contribution to the country's growth in science and technology through the training of scientists and technologists in both the nuclear area for peaceful and non-nuclear purposes. These achievements are achieved through the promotion and realization of high-level academic activities

== History ==
Nuclear research in the province of Rio Negro began as the [[Huemul Project]] in the Perón era. Nuclear facilities were organized as the [[Bariloche Atomic Centre]], under the direction of [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

An educational institution was established as the ''Instituto de Física de Bariloche'' on April 22, 1955, as a joint project of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[National University of Cuyo]]; the former administers the Bariloche Atomic Centre, whose work led to the first [[research reactor]] in Latin America (1957), as well as the region's first [[Generation II reactor|commercial reactor]], [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]], in 1974. The institute was renamed in 1962 to honor José Antonio Balseiro, who was its first director.

The first graduates were members of the Physics class of 1958. In the 1970s, Balseiro became the only institute in Argentina to grant degrees in [[nuclear engineering]], as the country was stepping up its nuclear program with the incorporation of the [[Embalse nuclear power plant|Embalse]] and [[Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha II]], as well as continued research activity in the Constituyentes and Bariloche reactors.

The '''Beaver Hall Group''' refers to a [[Montreal]]-based group of [[Canadians|Canadian]] painters who met in the late 1910s while studying art at a school run by the [[Art Association of Montreal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism. They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of [[Modern art|Modernist]] and traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All ten of the group's participants had studied under [[William Brymner]] (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of [[Randolph Stanley Hewton]], [[Edwin Holgate]], [[Mabel May]] and [[Lilias Torrance Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://artcore.ca/beaverhall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the [[downtown Montreal]] studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included [[Mabel Lockerby]], [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]], and President of the group, [[A.Y. Jackson]].

The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, [[A.Y. Jackson|Jackson]] emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel "with utter disregard for what
has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us," Jackson stressed, "individual expression is our chief concern".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; He identified its goals as being those of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the ''Montreal Gazette'' and ''La Presse'' gave generous coverage to the vernissage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO926-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition "The Beaver Hall Hill Group". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]] and [[A.Y. Jackson]] had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, ''1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group'' at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, "As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/correspondents/jazz-age-montreal-and-the-beaver-hall-group-canada-s-other-modernist-art-movement|title = Jazz Age Montreal and the Beaver Hall Group: Canada's Other Modernist Art Movement|date = December 14, 2015|accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = Magazine|publisher = National Gallery of Canada|last = Singhal|first = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46308">{{short description|psychological typology of male-to-female (MtF) transsexualism}}
'''Blanchard's transsexualism typology''', also '''Blanchard autogynephilia theory''' and '''Blanchard's taxonomy''', is a [[psychological typology]] of male-to-female (MtF) [[transsexualism]] created by [[Ray Blanchard]] through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of his colleague, [[Kurt Freund]].  Blanchard divided [[trans women]] into two different groups: "[[homosexual transsexual]]s", who Blanchard says seek [[sex reassignment surgery]] because they are feminine in both behavior and appearance, and to romantically and sexually attract (ideally heterosexual) men, and "autogynephilic transsexuals" who purportedly are sexually aroused at the idea of having a female body. Blanchard's model is unusual in that neither groups are considered "false transsexuals"; both autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals are thought to benefit from transition. This distinction is a recurring theme in scholarly literature on transsexualism.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bancroft J|title=Human sexuality and its problems|pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bI–Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA290 290–1]| year = 2009 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-443-05161-6 | chapter = Transgender gender nonconformity and transvestism | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the theory include sexual behavior scientists [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[James Cantor]], [[Alice Dreger]], and some openly transgender health care providers, [[Anne Lawrence]] and Maxine Peterson, and others who say that there are significant differences between the two proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Criticism of the research and theory has come from trans activists, including developmental biology researcher [[Julia Serano]], Jaimie Veale, Larry Nuttbrock, and some physicians, including Charles Allen Moser and [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], and others who say that the theory is poorly representative of trans women.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt;

In the [[transgender]] community, the theory has been the subject of controversy, which peaked with the publication of Bailey's ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' in 2003.

== History ==
The early history of the study of transsexualism is sparse; however, the concept of a categorization of transsexual people can be seen as early as 1923 with the work of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="hirschfeld1923"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hirschfeld | first = M | authorlink =  Magnus Hirschfeld | year = 1923 | title = Die intersexuelle Konstitution | journal = Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen | pages = 3–27 | volume = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, [[Harry Benjamin]] wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men, while feeling that oneself is a woman, was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual.&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benjamin H | authorlink = Harry Benjamin | year = 1966 | url = http://www.mut23.de/texte/Harry%20Benjamin%20-%20The%20Transsexual%20Phenomenon.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Transsexual Phenomenon | publisher = The Julian Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980 in the DSM-III, a  new diagnosis was introduced, that of "302.5 Transsexualism" under "Other Psychosexual Disorders". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for [[gender identity disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lothstein|first= Leslie Martin |title=Female-to-male transsexualism|publisher=Routledge |year=1983|page=60|isbn=0-7100-9476-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5HI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=transsexual+%2B+DSM+III|access-date=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic category, ''transsexualism'', was for [[gender dysphoria|gender dysphoric]] individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Walter |last=Meyer |author2=Walter O. Bockting |author3=Peggy Cohen-Kettenis |title=The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards Of Care For Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version |version=6th |publisher=Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2009-04-22 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012909/http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtypes were asexual, homosexual (same "biological sex"), heterosexual (other "biological sex") and unspecified.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;  This was removed in the DSM-IV, in which gender identity disorder replaced transsexualism. Previous taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms ''classic transsexual'' or ''true transsexual'', terms once used in [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

The clinical literature of Freund, Blanchard, and others has consistently divided male-to-female transsexuals into two distinct groups - "homosexual transsexuals," people who are sexually attracted to (ideally heterosexual) men and supposedly desire a normative female body to attract them, and "heterosexual fetishistic transvestites" in which the transsexual purportedly finds the idea of having a normative female body sexually arousing but desires a heterosexual female partner.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  Kurt Freund first distinguished between these two proposed types in a 1982 research article, theorizing that the "homosexual" transsexuals were qualitatively different from the so-called "heterosexual males" with gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="freund1982"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Freund K, Steiner BW, Chan S|date=February 1982|title=Two types of cross-gender identity|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=11|issue=1|pages=49–63|doi=10.1007/BF01541365|pmid=7073469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexologist [[Ray Blanchard]] coined the term "autogynephilia" in 1989 to describe this latter category of people.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  He stated that while they lacked a specific term to describe the concept, there was evidence for the concept among clinicians of the early 20th century.  [[Havelock Ellis]] used the terms ''eonism'' and ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' in 1913 to describe similar cross-gender feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 2005|title=Early history of the concept of autogynephilia|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=4|pages=439–46|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4343-8|pmid=16010466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 article on the concept by Ray Blanchard noted that [[Kurt Freund|Freund]] was probably the first author to distinguish between the erotic arousal due to dressing as a woman ([[transvestism]]) versus erotic arousal due to physically transforming into a more typically female form (autogynephilia).&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005" /&gt;

=== Development ===
Blanchard's observations at the Clarke Institute began by categorizing male-to-female transsexuals into four groups based off their supposed sexual orientations: "homosexual," "heterosexual," bisexual, and [[analloerotic]]s (i.e. trans women attracted to men, women, both, or neither, respectively.)&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=June 1985|title=Typology of male-to-female transsexualism|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=247–61|doi=10.1007/bf01542107|pmid=4004548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=October 1989|title=The concept of autogynephilia and the typology of male gender dysphoria|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=177|issue=10|pages=616–23|doi=10.1097/00005053-198910000-00004|pmid=2794988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard then conducted a series of studies on people [[assigned male at birth]] with gender dysphoria, including male-to-female transsexual people, and concluded that there existed only two distinct types.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW|date=April 1987|title=Heterosexual and homosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139–52|doi=10.1007/BF01542067|pmid=3592961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blanchard said that one type of gender dysphoria/transsexualism manifests itself in individuals who are exclusively attracted to men (Homosexual transsexuals averaged a [[Kinsey scale]] measurement of 5-6  and six is the maximum, or a 9.86±2.37 on the [[Modified Androphilia Scale]]&lt;ref name="lawrence2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lawrence AA, Latty EM, Chivers ML, Bailey JM|date=April 2005|title=Measurement of sexual arousal in postoperative male-to-female transsexuals using vaginal photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/files/pubs/Lawrenceetal2005.pdf|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=2|pages=135–45|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-1792-z|pmid=15803248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Leavitt F, Berger JC|date=October 1990|title=Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=19|issue=5|pages=491–505|doi=10.1007/BF02442350|pmid=2260914}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whom he referred to as ''homosexual transsexuals'', adopting Freund's terminology.&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; The other type he defined as including those who are attracted to females (gynephilic), attracted to both males and females (bisexual), and attracted to neither males nor females (''analloerotic'' or asexual); Blanchard referred to this latter set collectively as the ''non-homosexual transsexuals''.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989class"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 1989|title=The classification and labeling of nonhomosexual gender dysphorias|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=18|issue=4|pages=315–34|doi=10.1007/BF01541951|pmid=2673136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1988"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=January 1988|title=Nonhomosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=24|issue=1|pages=188–93|doi=10.1080/00224498809551410|pmid=22375647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard says that the "non-homosexual" transsexuals (but not the "homosexual" transsexuals) exhibit ''autogynephilia'',&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; which he defined as a [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest in having female anatomy.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|year=1991|title=Clinical observations and systematic studies of autogynephilia|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=17|issue=4|pages=235–51|doi=10.1080/00926239108404348|pmc=|pmid=1815090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey2003"&gt;Bailey, J.

Studies usually find that some number of non-homosexual transsexual report having no autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; When developing the typology, Blanchard found that gynephilic gender identity patients who reported never experiencing arousal to crossdressing were still measurably aroused by autogynephilic stimuli, and that autogynephilia among non-androphilic trans women was negatively associated with tendency to color their narrative to be more socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Blanchard to conclude that non-homosexual trans women who reported no autogynephilic interests were misrepresenting their stories. This conclusion has been criticized for being [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; and for being based on an incorrect way of measuring autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="moser2010" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
Within the typology, sexual orientation terms are usually used relative to biological sex. That is, "homosexual" refers to those attracted exclusively to men, while "non-homosexual" refers to those who are attracted to other people than men or who are attracted to neither men nor women. "Homosexual" is used this way partly because of the scientific precedent. One of the types of transsexuals described within the theory is known as homosexual transsexuals. They are thought to be fundamentally the same phenomenon as the most feminine gay men. This similarity between homosexual transsexuals and homosexual men is also part of the reason why "homosexual" is used relative to biological sex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The word "autogynephilia" refers to a propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of one self as a woman. This paraphilia is related to [[transvestic fetishism]].

== Theory ==
The typology divides male-to-female transsexuals into two groups: homosexual and autogynephilic. Homosexual transsexuals are thought of as being extremely feminine gay men, while autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be sexually attracted to the image of themselves as women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attraction to the image of oneself as a woman is called ''autogynephilia''. The homosexual type corresponds to what is known as early-onset in other sources, while the autogynephilic type corresponds to what is known as late-onset in other sources. Homosexual transsexuals are proposed to be motivated by being very feminine in both behavior and appearance, and by a desire to romantically and sexually attract (ideally very masculine) men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be motivated by their sexual desire and romantic love for being women.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt;

Homosexual transsexuals are very feminine from a young age. According to Bailey and Zucker, non-transgender gay men are also often very feminine when young, but usually learn to live in a more masculine role when they grow up. They argue that homosexual transsexuals differ because they encounter early adversity that prevented them from defeminizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men find the femininity of homosexual transsexuals very unattractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=76-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the homosexual transsexuals themselves are very attracted to masculinity that they have trouble finding in gay men. As a result, homosexual transsexuals may be partially motivated by a desire to attract straight men.

Autogynephiles have sexual fantasies about being women. These fantasies may focus on a variety of things associated with womanhood, such as anatomy, clothing or behavior. Blanchard found that the specific form the autogynephilia takes on correlates with the likelihood of transition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Erotic target location errors ===
{{See also|Erotic target location error|Furry fandom|Paraphilic infantilism}}
Ray Blanchard conjectured that autogynephilia is a misdirected form of heterosexuality, with the attraction to women being redirected towards the self instead of others. These forms of erotic target location errors have also been observed with other base orientations than gynephilia, such as pedophilia, [[acrotomophilia]] and attraction to plush animals. Anne Lawrence argued that these phenomena provide further support for autogynephilia theory:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the existence of these analogs of autogynephilic transsexualism calls into question the most influential biological and psychoanalytic theories of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism, because such theories should also be able to account for these analogous phenomena but cannot easily do so. For example: It is plausible that hormonal abnormalities during prenatal development could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed in a female-typical direction. It is less plausible that a prenatal developmental disturbance could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed like that of an amputee or a plush animal. [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider it more parsimonious to theorize that autogynephilic MtF transsexualism and the analogous conditions that exist in men who are sexually attracted to children, amputees, plush animals, and perhaps real animals, all represent manifestations of an unusual type of paraphilia in which affected men feel sexually aroused by the idea of impersonating or becoming whatever category of person or thing they find sexually attractive. Their paraphilic desires, in turn, often give rise to strongly held, highly valued alternative identities that ultimately become their dominant identities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Autopedophiles have been found to be more likely than other pedophiles to have considered whether they would be better off as a child, and more likely to have considered hormones or surgery to look more like a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Bailey JM | title = Autopedophilia | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–123 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27899472 | doi = 10.1177/0956797616677082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autogynephilic vs. homosexual transsexuals ===
By definition, autogynephilic transsexuals are autogynephilic while homosexual transsexuals are androphilic. However, a number of other differences between the types have been found. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life,&lt;ref name="onesixtytwo"&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179, 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; have lower IQs,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or [[asexuality|asexual]].&lt;ref name="onesixtytwo" /&gt; They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise [[paraphilic]] arousal.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Lawrence has proposed that autogynephilic transsexuals are more excited about [[Sex reassignment surgery|sexual reassignment surgery]] than homosexual transsexuals. She finds that homosexual transsexuals are typically ambivalent or indifferent about SRS, while autogynephilic transsexuals want to have surgery as quickly as possible, are happy to be rid of their penis, and proud of their new genitals.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt; Michael Bailey argued that homosexual transsexuals are unlikely to transition if their appearance as women would be very unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transsexuals who are active on the internet and in transsexual support groups are overwhelmingly autogynephilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA, Bailey JM | title = Transsexual groups in Veale et al.

Autogynephilia is most notable for its use in Blanchard's taxonomy to explain the presence of [[gender dysphoria]] in "non-homosexual" ([[gynephilia|gynephilic]]) [[male-to-female transsexual]]s, in contrast to the  gender dysphoria observed in "homosexual" ([[androphilia|androphilic]]) transsexuals.  Autogynephilia has also been suggested to pertain to romantic love as well as to sexual arousal patterns.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Becoming what we love: autogynephilic transsexualism conceptualized as an expression of romantic love | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 506–20 | date = 2007-10-24 | pmid = 17951885 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2007.0050 | url = http://www.annelawrence.com/becoming_what_we_love.pdf | publisher = Elsevier | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanchard provides specific case examples to illustrate the autogynephilic sexual fantasies that people reported:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2005/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Philip was a 38-year-old professional man referred to the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine that he was a nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sexuality ===
According to Blanchard, "An autogynephile does not necessarily become sexually aroused every time he pictures himself as female or engages in feminine behavior, any more than a heterosexual man automatically gets an erection whenever he sees an attractive woman. Thus, the concept of autogynephilia—like that of heterosexuality, homosexuality, or pedophilia—refers to a ''potential'' for sexual excitation"&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt; [emphasis in original].

Blanchard classified four subtypes of autogynephilic sexual fantasies, but noted that "All four types of autogynephilia tend to occur in combination with other types rather than alone."&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blanchard1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transvestic autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of wearing typically feminine clothing
*Behavioral autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of doing something regarded as feminine
*Physiologic autogynephilia: arousal to fantasies of body functions specific to people regarded as female
*Anatomic autogynephilia: arousal to the fantasy of having a normative woman's body, or parts of one

Other authors have distinguished between behavioral autogynephilia and interpersonal gynephilia, with the latter being arousal to being seen or admired as a woman or having sex with men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Rosenthal AM, Bailey JM | title = The Psychometric Structure of Items Assessing Autogynephilia | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 1301–12 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25277693 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0397-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist male assigned at birth people who report being sexually aroused by the image or idea of having ''some'' but not ''all'' normative female anatomy, such as having breasts but retaining their penis and testicles; Blanchard referred to this phenomenon as ''partial autogynephilia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = The she-male phenomenon and the concept of partial autogynephilia | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–76 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8468711 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Partial versus complete autogynephilia and gender dysphoria | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–7 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8308916 | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DSM-5===
In [[DSM-5]], published in 2013, ''With autogynephilia'' (sexual arousal by thoughts, images of self as a female) is a specifier to '''302.3 [[Transvestic disorder]]''' (intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing fantasies, urges or behaviors); the other specifier is  ''With [[fetishism]]'' (sexual arousal to fabrics, materials or garments).&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book | last= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=685–705 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender dysphoria ===
{{See also|Causes of transsexuality}}
Blanchard found that anatomic autogynephilia was more associated with gender dysphoria than transvestic autogynephilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-5181-5|location=|pages=22-23, 24-26, 140-142, 155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different pattern was found in a sample of non-transgender autogynephilic men, where higher degrees of anatomic autogynephilia were associated with less gender dysphoria; here, it was instead interpersonal and physiological autogynephilia that predicted gender dysphoria. The men in this sample were significantly more gender dysphoric than the non-transgender male baseline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Autogynephilia in cisgender women ===
Two studies have tested the possibility that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales.&lt;ref name="veale2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Clarke DE, Lomax TC | title = Sexuality of male-to-female transsexuals | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 586–97 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18299976 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9306-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moser (2009) created an ''Autogynephilia Scale for Women'' based on items used to categorize MtF transsexuals as autogynephilic in other studies. A questionnaire that included the ASW was distributed to a sample of 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of "frequent" arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032" /&gt; However, Anne Lawrence criticized these studies' methodology and conclusions and asserted that genuine autogynephilia occurs very rarely, if ever, in natal women.&lt;ref name="pmid20069491"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Something resembling autogynephilia in women: comment on Moser (2009) | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20069491 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903445749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticism==
The concept received attention when sex researcher and trans woman [[Anne Lawrence]] described it on her website in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1998"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawrence | first = AA | url = http://home.swipnet.se/~w-13968/autogynephilia.html | title = Men Trapped in Men's Bodies:An Introduction to the Concept of Autogynephilia | date = 1998-10-01 | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, when Bailey published ''The Man Who Would Be Queen'', in which he based his portrayal of male-to-female transsexual people on Blanchard's taxonomy, an enormous controversy resulted.&lt;ref name="Dreger2008" /&gt;

Jaimie Veale gathered a convenience sample over the Internet of trans women's impressions of and opinions on Blanchard's typology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale J, Clark DE, Lomax TC  |date=2012|title=Male-to-female transsexuals’ impressions of Blanchard’s autogynephilia theory | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism |volume=13|issue=3|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/15532739.2011.669659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people answering the survey, 52.5% had a negative response.  Of the 170 respondents, 33 said the typology was too narrow and restrictive, 15 said it did not apply to their experiences, and 5 that the typology was driven by questionable motives such as "to encourage 'elitist divisionism'."  Other participants, however, said they did, in fact, experience autogynephilia.

Criticism of the theory of "homosexual transsexuals" is generally focused in two categories: the use of the terms "homosexual" and "non-homosexual" to refer to MtF transsexuals by their assigned sex&lt;ref name="bagemihl"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagemihl | first = B | chapter = Surrogate phonology and transsexual faggotry: A linguistic analogy for uncoupling sexual orientation from gender identity | title = Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality | editors = Livia A; Hall K : | page = 380 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0-19-510471-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin |first=Harry |title=The Transsexual Phenomenon |location=Chapter 2, Paragraph 16 |url=http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm#Relationship%20to%20homosexuality |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913065950/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm |archive-date=September 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the data underlying the theory itself.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Autogynephilia in women | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 539–47 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19591032 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903005212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veale2008" /&gt; Harry Benjamin, in his seminal work ''The Transsexual Phenomenon'', opined that the question "is a transsexual homosexual?" had both "yes" and "no" answers depending on whether sexual anatomy or [[gender identity]] was prioritised, and in cases of post-operative male-to-female transsexuals, describing them as "homosexual men" was against "common sense and reason".&lt;ref name="Benjamin" /&gt; The terminology has also been described as confusing and controversial among transsexuals seeking sexual reassignment,&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt; archaic,&lt;ref name="wahng"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wahng | first = SJ | year = 2004 | chapter = Transmasculinity and Asian American Gendering | editors = Aldama AJ | title =Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | isbn = 0-253-34171-X | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 292]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 307n8] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demeaning.&lt;ref name="leiblum2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leiblum | first = SR |author2=Rosen RC | year = 2000 | title = Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy | edition = 3rd | isbn = 1-57230-574-6 | publisher = [[Guilford Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 sexologist [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women, and that he now tries to use words more sensitively.&lt;ref name="Bancroftcomment"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bancroft J | title = Lust or identity? | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 426–8; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431640 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9317-1 | publisher = Springer | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Moser, a sexuality advocate, criticized Blanchard's theory, stating that it uses an overly-broad definition of autogynephilia, is not sufficiently relevant to MtF transsexual patients, fails to account for all information on sexual and romantic interests of homosexual and transsexual people, and lacks supporting data.&lt;ref name="moser2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Blanchard's Autogynephilia Theory: a critique | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–809 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20582803 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2010.486241 | edition = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaimie Veale, a psychology academic, published an alternative theory in 2010 which proposes that variances in gender identity are driven by personality and social factors which determine whether psychological [[defense mechanism]]s are employed to avoid or repress gender nonconformity, resulting in the later expression of this gender nonconformity.&lt;ref name="veale2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Lomax T, Clarke D | doi = 10.1080/15532739.2010.514217 | title = Identity-Defense Model of Gender-Variant Development | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–138 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Serano]], a trans activist, wrote that there were flaws in Blanchard's original papers, including that they were conducted among overlapping populations primarily at the [[Clarke Institute]] in [[Toronto]] without nontranssexual controls, that the subtypes were not empirically derived but instead were "[[begging the question]] that transsexuals fall into subtypes based on their sexual orientation," and that further research had found a non-deterministic correlation between cross-gender arousal and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="serano"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Serano | first1 = J. M. | title = The Case Against Autogynephilia | url = http://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf | doi = 10.1080/15532739.2010.514223 | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 176–187 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that Blanchard did not discuss the idea that cross-gender arousal may be an effect, rather than a cause, of gender dysphoria, and that Blanchard assumed that [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation implied causation]].&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Serano also stated that the wider idea of cross-gender arousal was affected by the prominence of [[sexual objectification]] of women, accounting for both a relative lack of cross-gender arousal in transsexual men and similar patterns of autogynephilic arousal in non-transsexual women.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Serano criticised proponents of the theory, claiming that they dismiss non-autogynephilic, non-androphilic transsexuals as misreporting or lying while not questioning androphilic transsexuals, describing it as "tantamount to hand-picking which evidence counts and which does not based upon how well it conforms to the model",&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; either making the theory unscientific due to its unfalsifiability, or invalid due to the nondeterministic correlation that later studies found.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Further criticisms alleged that the theory undermined lived experience of transsexual women, contributed to pathologisation and sexualisation of transsexual women, and the literature itself fed into the stereotype of transsexuals as "purposefully deceptive", which could be used to justify discrimination and violence against transsexuals.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt;

T. M. Bettcher, based on her own experience as a trans woman, has critiqued the notion of "autogynephilia," and "target errors" generally, within a framework of "erotic structuralism," arguing that the notion conflates essential distinctions between "source of attraction" and "erotic content," and "(erotic) interest" and "(erotic) attraction," thus misinterpreting what she prefers to call, following Serano, "female embodiment eroticism." She maintains that not only is "an erotic interest in oneself as a gendered being," as she puts it, a non-pathological and indeed necessary component of regular sexual attraction to others, but within the framework of erotic structuralism, a "misdirected" attraction to oneself as postulated by Blanchard is outright nonsensical.&lt;ref name="Bettcher2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bettcher TM | title = When selves have sex: what the phenomenology of trans sexuality can teach about sexual orientation | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 605–20 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24295078 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2014.865472 | url = https://www.academia.edu/5300966/When_Selves_Have_Sex_What_The_Phenomenology_of_Trans_Sexuality_Can_Teach_About_Sexual_Orientation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misgendering language ===
According to Leavitt and Berger (1990), "Transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the [[homosexual transsexual]] label and its pejorative baggage (Morgan, 1978).  As a rule, they are highly invested in a heterosexual life-style and are repulsed by notions of homosexual relations with males. Attention from males often serves to validate their feminine status."&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt;

Trans man [[Aaron Devor]] wrote, "If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic... I see absolutely no reason to continue with language that people find offensive when there is perfectly serviceable, in fact better, language that is not offensive."&lt;ref name="lane2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane R | title = Truth, lies, and trans science | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–6; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431622 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9336-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other transsexual people are opposed to any and all models of diagnosis which allow medical professionals to prevent anyone from changing their sex, and seek their removal from the DSM.&lt;ref name="shefer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Psychology|last=Shefer|first=Tamara|last2=Boonzaier|first2=Floretta | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Juta and Company Limited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-919713-92-2|edition=Illustrated|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 273–4]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 282]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of misconduct ===
Trans activist [[Lynn Conway]] blogged extensively about the publication of Bailey's book by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] and along with other activists accused Bailey of misconduct. [[Northwestern University]] investigated Bailey, but did not reveal the findings of that investigation and did not comment on whether or not Bailey had been punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = R | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Northwestern-U-Concludes/103078/ | title = Northwestern U. Concludes Investigation of Sex Researcher but Keeps Results Secret | publisher = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = 2004-12-10 | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a summary of the controversy written by Northwestern University [[bioethicist]] and historian [[Alice Dreger]], the accusations were unfounded and comprised an attempt by those activists to silence Bailey for expressing views that contrasted with the public image they wanted.  The accusations themselves did not hold up to scrutiny, according to Dreger's analysis.  For example, two of the four transsexual women who accused Bailey of misusing their stories in the book were not actually mentioned in the book at all.&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger AD | title = The controversy surrounding "The man who would be queen": a case history of the politics of science, identity, and sex in the Internet age | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 366–421 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431641 | pmc = 3170124 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger studied the reactions of trans activists and other controversies in her 2015 book ''[[Galileo's Middle Finger]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's middle finger: heretics, activists, and the search for justice in science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that although the science appears correct that eroticism is behind the typology of transgenderism, activists in the trans community preferred the simpler narrative of literally being one sex trapped in the body of the other.  Dreger says, "Autogynephilia is perhaps best understood as a love that would really rather we didn’t speak its name",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"/&gt; in reference to the famous expression ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'' formerly used to refer to homosexuality or [[pederasty]].

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are generated by immune activation of [[cytotoxic T cells]] (T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; cells). They are generally CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which makes them [[MHC class I]] restricted. CTLs are able to eliminate most cells in the body since most nucleated cells express class I MHC molecules. The CTL-mediated immune system can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, functional effector CTLs are generated from naive T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; cells through activation and differentiation. In the second phase, affector CTLs destroy target cells by recognizing the antigen-MHC class I complex.

== Phase 1 ==

In phase one, effector CTLs are generated from CTL precursors. The CTL precursors include naive T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; cells since they are incapable of killing target cells. After a precursor cell has been activated, it can then differentiate into a functional CTL with cytotoxic activity. There are three sequential signals that are required to complete this process.

First, there is [[T cell receptor|TCR]] recognition of the peptide-MHC class I complex. This step allows the cell to become licensed to an [[antigen presenting cell]].

Second, a costimulatory signal is transmitted by the interaction between [[CD28]] and [[B7 (protein)|B7]] of the precursor cell and the licensed antigen presenting cell.

Last, a signal is induced by the interaction between [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] and the high-affinity [[IL-2 receptor]]. This results in proliferation and differentiation of the antigen-activated precursor cell into a functional effector CTL.

== Phase 2 ==

In phase two, the now functional effector CTLs destroy the target cells. This can be done in two ways. These pathways are the cytotoxic protein pathway and the Fas ligand pathway. [[Apoptosis]] is the primary mechanism for both of these pathways.

===Cytotoxic Protein Pathway===
One pathway is the cytotoxic protein pathway. In this pathway perforins and [[granzymes]] are taken up by the target cell. In this pathway, the perforins facilitate the entry of granule contents into the cell. The granzymes then activate the endogenous apoptosis pathway, which induces cell death without necrosis. This leaves packages of fragmented DNA material from the target cell for the [[macrophages]] to dispose of.

===Fas Ligand Pathway===
The other pathway is the Fas ligand pathway. In this pathway, a Fas ligand (FasL) on the CTL binds to [[Fas receptor]] (FasR) on the target cell. This pathway is independent of granzymes. Instead it involves Interleukin-1β converting enzyme ([[Caspase 1|ICE]]; also known as [[Caspase 1]]) activation, which is similar to [[granzyme B]]. This ultimately leads to DNA fragmentation.

The '''Clean Development Mechanism''' ('''CDM''') is one of the [[Flexible Mechanisms]] defined in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (IPCC, 2007) that provides for emissions reduction projects which generate [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CERs) which may be traded in [[emissions trading]] schemes.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web

The CDM, defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, was intended to meet two objectives: 
*(1) to assist parties not included in [[Annex I]] in achieving [[sustainable development]] and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), which is to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]]; and 
*(2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments ([[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emission caps).&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Chance LLP (2013). "Clean Development Mechanism: CDM and the UNFCC" http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/CDM%26UNFCCCcorrected.pdf . Advocates for International Development. Retrieved 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Annex I" parties are the countries listed in Annex I of the treaty, the industrialized countries. Non-Annex I parties are [[developing countries]].

The CDM addresses the second objective by allowing the Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by buying [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units from CDM emission reduction projects in developing countries (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Both the projects and the issue of CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and "additional." The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;159).&lt;ref name=grubb/&gt; Between 2001, which was the first year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units.&lt;ref name="giga"&gt;{{cite press release

However, a number of weaknesses of the CDM have been identified (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265-267){{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Several of these issues were addressed by the new [[Program of Activities (PoA)]], which moves to approving 'bundles' of projects instead of accrediting each project individually. In 2012, the report ''Climate Change, Carbon Markets and the CDM: A Call to Action'' said governments urgently needed to address the future of the CDM. It suggested the CDM was in danger of collapse because of the low price of carbon and the failure of governments to guarantee its existence into the future. Writing on the website of the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], Yolanda Kakabadse, a member of the investigating panel for the report and founder of Fundación Futuro Latinamericano, said a strong CDM is needed to support the political consensus essential for future climate progress. "Therefore we must do everything in our hands to keep it working," she said.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

The clean development mechanism is one of the "flexibility mechanisms" defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility mechanisms were designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007).&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the Kyoto Protocol by the US government. [[Developing countries]] were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=carbont&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that the mechanisms will continue.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the "non-Annex I" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The CDM is one of the Protocol's "project-based" mechanisms, in that the CDM is designed to promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction "production" (Toth ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;660).&lt;ref&gt;

The baseline emissions are the emissions that are predicted to occur in the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are "credited" against this baseline, in the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts.

The economic basis for including developing countries in efforts to reduce emissions is that emission cuts are thought to be less expensive in developing countries than developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30;&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in developing countries, environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in developed countries (Sathaye ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;387-389).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Emissions from developing countries are projected to increase substantially over this century (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; Infrastructure decisions made in developing countries could therefore have a very large influence on future efforts to limit total global emissions (Fisher ''et al''., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-03-18|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDM is designed to start developing countries off on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for the reductions.

There were two main concerns about the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15). One was over the [[additionality]] of emission reductions produced by the CDM (see the section on ''additionality''). The other was whether it would allow rich, northern countries, and in particular, companies, to impose projects that were contrary to the development interests of host countries. To alleviate this concern, the CDM requires host countries to confirm that CDM projects contribute to their own sustainable development. International rules also prohibit credits for some kinds of activities, notably [[nuclear power]] and avoided [[deforestation]].

To prevent industrialised countries from making unlimited use of CDM, the framework has a provision that use of CDM be ‘supplemental’ to domestic actions to reduce emissions. This wording has led to a wide range of interpretations - the Netherlands for example aims to achieve half of its required emission reductions (from a BAU baseline) by CDM.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It treats Dutch companies' purchases of [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] allowances from companies in other countries as part of its domestic actions.

The CDM gained momentum in 2005 after the Kyoto Protocol took effect. Before the Protocol entered into force, investors considered this{{clarify|date=July 2016}} a key risk factor. The initial years of operation yielded fewer CDM credits than supporters had hoped for, as parties did not provide sufficient funding to the EB, which left it understaffed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Adaptation Fund was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Fund is to be financed with a share of proceeds from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities and receive funds from other sources.

==CDM project process==

===Outline===
An industrialised country that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain the consent of the developing country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the [[carbon project]] would not have happened anyway (establishing [[additionality]]), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs, commonly known as [[carbon credit]]s, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e, e.g. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE.

===Additionality===

To avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway ("freeriders"), specified rules ensure the [[additionality]] of the proposed project, that is, ensure the project reduces emissions more than would have occurred in the absence of the intervention created by the CDM.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the CDM Executive Board deems a project additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that CDM helps it overcome. Current Guidance from the EB is available at the UNFCCC website.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=UNFCCC Tools
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseline===

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

The determination of [[additionality]] and the calculation of emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.

===Methodologies===

Any proposed CDM project has to use an approved baseline and monitoring methodology to be validated, approved and registered. Baseline Methodology will set steps to determine the baseline within certain applicability conditions whilst monitoring methodology will set specific steps to determine monitoring parameters, quality assurance, equipment to be used, in order to obtain data to calculate the emission reductions. Those approved methodologies are all coded:&lt;ref name=UNFCCCMETHBOOK&gt;http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/documentation/meth_booklet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AM''' - Approved Methodology

'''ACM''' - Approved Consolidated Methodology

'''AMS''' - Approved Methodology for Small Scale Projects

'''ARAM''' - Aforestation and Reforestation Approved Methodologies

All baseline methodologies approved by Executive Board are publicly available along with relevant guidance on the UNFCCC CDM website.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/cdm&lt;/ref&gt; If a DOE determines that a proposed project activity intends to use a new baseline methodology, it shall, prior to the submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the EB for review, i.e. consideration and approval, if appropriate.&lt;ref name="CDMCharts0511"&gt;Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (May, 2011) CDM in Charts Version 13.1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

According to Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37, crediting mechanisms like the CDM could play three important roles in [[climate change mitigation]] :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Improve the cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation policies in developed countries
*Help to reduce "leakage" ([[carbon leakage]]) of emissions from developed to developing countries. Leakage is where mitigation actions in one country or economic sector result in another country's or sector's emissions increasing, e.g., through relocation of polluting industries from Annex I to non-Annex I countries (Barker ''et al.'', 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Boost transfers of clean, less polluting technologies to developing countries.

According to Burniaux ''et al''. (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37), the cost-saving potential of a well-functioning crediting mechanism appears to be very large. Compared to baseline costs (i.e., costs where emission reductions only take place in Annex I countries), if the cap on offset use was set at 20%, one estimate suggests mitigation costs could be halved. This cost saving, however, should be viewed as an upper bound: it assumes no transaction costs and no uncertainty on the delivery of emission savings. Annex I countries who stand to gain most from crediting include Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In this economic model, non-Annex I countries enjoy a slight income gain from exploiting low cost emission reductions.
Actual transaction cost in the CDM are rather high, which is problematic for smaller projects.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2010, States and Trend of the Carbon Market http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCARBONFINANCE/Resources/State_and_Trends_of_the_Carbon_Market_2010_low_res.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is addressed by the [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] modality.

===Difficulties with the CDM===

'''Carbon leakage'''

In theory, leakage may be reduced by crediting mechanisms (Burniaux ''et al.'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;38). In practice, the amount of leakage partly depends on the definition of the baseline against which credits are granted. The current CDM approach already incorporates some leakage. Thus, reductions in leakage due to the CDM may, in fact, be small or even non-existent.

'''Additionality, transaction costs and bottlenecks'''

In order to maintain the environmental effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol, emission savings from the CDM must be additional (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265).&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite web
|year=2010
|author=World Bank
|title=World Development Report 2010: Development and Climate Change
|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433
|url=http://go.worldbank.org/BKLQ9DSDU0
|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without additionality, the CDM amounts to an income [[transfer payment|transfer]] to non-Annex I countries (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;40). Additionality is, however, difficult to prove, the subject of vigorous debate.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;

Burniaux ''et al''. (2009) commented on the large [[transaction cost]]s of establishing additionality. Assessing additionality has created delays (bottlenecks) in approving CDM projects. According to the [[World Bank]] (2010), there are significant constraints to the continued growth of the CDM to support mitigation in developing countries.

'''Incentives'''

The CDM rewards emissions reductions, but does not penalize emission increases (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction [[subsidy]]. This can create a [[perverse incentive]] for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, with the aim of getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term.

Another difficulty is that the CDM might reduce the incentive for non-Annex I countries to cap their emissions. This is because most developing countries benefit more from a well-functioning crediting mechanism than from a world [[carbon emission trading|emissions trading]] scheme (ETS), where their emissions are capped. This is true except in cases where the allocation of emissions rights (i.e., the amount of emissions that each country is allowed to emit) in the ETS is particularly favourable to developing countries.

'''Local resistance'''

While the C in CDM stands for Clean, most projects might be better defined with the B from Big, from large hydropower to HFC or waste to energy and clean coal projects (which all together make the majority of credits generated through CDM). The argument in favor of the CDM is that it brings development to the South. However, in all continents the mainly Big Development it stands for is resisted by local people in those countries. A global coalition of researchers published a large report on African civil society resistance to CDM projects all over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;18th of April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In New Delhi, India, a grassroots movement of wastepickers is resisting another CDM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2012/02/watch-a-gaia-ejolt-video-on-waste-wars-in-delhi/|title=Watch a GAIA-EJOLT video on Waste Wars in Delhi - Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade|author=|date=|website=www.ejolt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; on what the makers call 'the waste war' in Delhi.

&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society groups and researchers in both North and South have complained for years that most CDM projects benefit big industries, while doing harm to excluded people. As local protests against CDM projects are arising on every continent, the notion that CDM 'brings development to the South' is contested.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''Market deflation'''

Most of the [[demand]] for CERs from the CDM comes from the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], which is the largest carbon market. In July 2012, the [[market price]] for CERs fell to new record low of €2.67 a tonne, a drop in price of about 70% in a year. Analysts attributed the low CER price to lower prices for European Union emissions allowances, oversupply of EU emissions allowances and the slowing European economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, ''The Economist'' described the CDM as a "complete disaster in the making" and "in need of a radical overhaul". Carbon prices, including prices for CERs, had collapsed from $20 a tonne in August 2008 to below $5 in response to the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone debt crisis]] reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Financial issues==
With costs of emission reduction typically much lower in developing countries than in industrialised countries, industrialised countries can comply with their emission reduction targets at much lower cost by receiving credits for emissions reduced in developing countries as long as administration costs are low.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has projected GDP losses for [[OECD]] Europe with full use of CDM and [[Joint Implementation]] to between 0.13% and 0.81% of GDP versus 0.31% to 1.50%&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change 2001 - Synthesis report. Figure SPM-8, IPCC, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; with only domestic action.

While there would always be some cheap domestic emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the [[counterparty]] is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.

===Mitigation finance===

The revenues of the CDM constitutes the largest source of mitigation finance to developing countries to date (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;261-262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; Over the 2001 to 2012 period, CDM projects could raise $18&amp;nbsp;billion ($15&amp;nbsp;billion to $24&amp;nbsp;billion) in direct carbon revenues for developing countries. Actual revenues will depend on the price of carbon. It is estimated that some $95&amp;nbsp;billion in clean energy investment benefitted from the CDM over the 2002-08 period.

===Adaptation finance===

The CDM is the main source of income for the [[UNFCCC]] Adaptation Fund, which was established in 2007 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262-263).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $600&amp;nbsp;million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price.

The EU ETS allowed firms to comply with their commitments by buying offset credits, and thus created a perceived value to projects. The Kyoto Protocol set the CDM on a firm legal footing.

By the end of 2008, over 4,000 CDM projects had been submitted for validation, and of those, over 1,000 were registered by the CDM Executive Board, and were therefore entitled to be issued CERs (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;19). In 2010, the World Bank estimated that in 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs would be from China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%) (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean would make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

By 14 September 2012, 4626 projects had been registered by the CDM Executive Board as CDM projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Destruction of HFC-23 ===

Some CDM projects remove or destroy industrial gases, such as [[Fluoroform|hydrofluorocarbon-23]] (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from the production of the refrigerant gas [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (HCFC-22).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.&lt;ref name="chill1"&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, the Carbon Trust estimated that industrial gas projects such as those limiting HFC-23 emissions, would contribute about 20% of the CERs issued by the CDM in 2012. The Carbon Trust expressed the concern that projects for destroying HFC-23 were so profitable that coolant manufacturers could be building new factories to produce the coolant gas. (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; In September 2010, [[Sandbag]] estimated that in 2009 59% of the CERs used as offsets in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] originated from HFC-23 projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From 2005 to June 2012, 19 manufacturers of refrigerants (11 in China, 5 in India, and one each in Argentina, Mexico and South Korea),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

David Hanrahan, the technical director of IDEAcarbon believes each plant would probably have earned an average of $20 million to $40 million a year from the CDM. The payments also incentivise the increased production of the ozone-depleting refrigerant HCFC-22, and discourage substitution of HCFC-22 with less harmful refrigerants.&lt;ref name="chill1" /&gt;

In 2007 the CDM stopped accepting new refrigerant manufacturers into the CDM. In 2011, the CDM renewed contracts with the nineteen manufacturers on the condition that claims for HFC-23 destruction would be limited to 1 percent of their coolant production. However, in 2012, 18 percent of all CERs issued are expected to go to the 19 coolant plants, compared with 12 percent to 2,372 wind power plants and 0.2 percent to 312 solar projects.&lt;ref name="chill1"/&gt;

In January 2011, the [[European Union]] Climate Change Committee banned the use of HFC-23 CERs in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity, the under-mining of the [[Montreal Protocol]], costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced [[developing countries]] getting too many CERs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Barriers==

World Bank (n.d., p.&amp;nbsp;12) described a number of barriers to the use of the CDM in [[least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name=wbnd/&gt; LDCs have experienced lower participation in the CDM to date. Four CDM decisions were highlighted as having a disproportionate negative impact on LDCs:
*'''Suppressed demand''': Baseline calculations for LDCs are low, meaning that projects cannot generate sufficient [[carbon finance]] to have an impact.
*'''Treatment of projects that replace non-renewable biomass''': A decision taken led to essentially a halving in the emission reduction potential of these projects. This has particularly affected [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and projects in poor communities, where firewood, often from non-renewable sources, is frequently used as a fuel for cooking and heating.
*'''Treatment of forestry projects and exclusion of agriculture under the CDM''': These sectors are more important for LDCs than for middle-income countries. Credits from forestry projects are penalized under the CDM, leading to depressed demand and price.
*'''Transaction costs and CDM process requirements''': These are geared more towards the most advanced developing countries, and do not work well for the projects most often found in LDCs.

==Views on the CDM==

===Additionality===

====Emissions====

One of the difficulties of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;54-56).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their [[additionality]] assessments. They compared establishing [[additionality]] to the balance of evidence in a legal system. Certainty in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions.

====Types====

Additionality is much contested. There are many rival interpretations of additionality:

# What is often labelled ‘environmental additionality’ has that a project is additional if the emissions from the project are lower than the baseline. It generally looks at what would have happened without the project.
# Another interpretation, sometimes termed ‘project additionality’, the project must not have happened without the CDM.

A number of terms for different kinds of additionality have been discussed, leading to some confusion, particularly over the terms 'financial additionality' and 'investment additionality' which are sometimes used as synonyms. 'Investment additionality', however, was a concept discussed and ultimately rejected during negotiation of the Marrakech Accords. Investment additionality carried the idea that any project that surpasses a certain risk-adjusted profitability threshold would automatically be deemed non-additional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=37532|title=VROM (Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment|author=|date=|website=vrom.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Financial additionality' is often defined as an economically non-viable project becoming viable as a direct result of CDM revenues.

Many investors argue that the environmental additionality interpretation would make the CDM simpler. Environmental NGOs have argued that this interpretation would open the CDM to free-riders, permitting developed countries to emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;, while failing to produce emission reductions in the CDM host countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326 Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM]; International Rivers; December 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillenwater (2011) evaluated the various definitions of [[additionality]] used within the CDM community and provided a synthesis definition that rejects the notion of there being different types of additionality.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gillenwater, M. |title=What Is Additionality?

Schneider (2007) produced a report on the CDM for the WWF.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{Cite web
|date=5 November 2007
|author=Schneider, L.
|title=Is the CDM fulfilling its environmental and sustainable development objectives? An evaluation of the CDM and options for improvement

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the report were based on a systematic evaluation of 93 randomly chosen registered CDM projects, as well as interviews and a literature survey (p.&amp;nbsp;5). According to Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;72), the additionality of a significant number of projects over the 2004-2007 period seemed to be either unlikely or questionable.

It is never possible to establish with certainty what would have happened without the CDM or in absence of a particular project, which is one common objection to the CDM. Nevertheless, official guidelines have been designed to facilitate uniform assessment,&lt;ref&gt;Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 03), UNFCCC CDM EB, EB 29&lt;/ref&gt; set by the CDM Executive Board for assessing additionality.

====Views on additionality====

An argument against additionality is based on the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (Müller, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;''iv'',&amp;nbsp;9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|date=March 2009

|df=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these basis, "business-as-usual" (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an argument against having additionality, in the sense that non-additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited.

Müller (2009) argued that compromise was necessary between having additionality and not having it. In his view, additionality should sometimes be used, but other times, it shouldn't.

According to World Bank (n.d., pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17), additionality is crucial in maintaining the environmental integrity of the carbon market.&lt;ref name=wbnd&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain this integrity, it was suggested that projects meeting or exceeding ambitious policy objectives or technical standards could be deemed additional.

===Concerns===

====Overall efficiency====
Pioneering research has suggested that an average of approximately 30% of the money spent on the open market buying CDM credits goes directly to project operating and capital expenditure costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/project-offsetting-costs|title=Carbon Retirement report: The Efficiency of Carbon Offsetting through the Clean Development Mechanism|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahya|first=Damian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8399740.stm|title='30% of carbon offsets' spent on reducing emissions|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other significant costs include the broker's premium (about 30%, understood to represent the risk of a project not delivering) and the project shareholders' dividend (another 30%). The researchers noted that the sample of projects studied was small, the range of figures was wide and that their methodology of estimating values slightly overstated the average broker's premium.

====The risk of fraud====
One of the main problems concerning CDM-projects is the risk of fraud.&lt;ref name="VODO"&gt;{{cite web|last=VODO vzw &amp; 11.11.11|title=CDM: schoon genoeg? Vlaams en federaal CDM-beleid onder de loep|url=http://www.vodo.be/index.php/component/content/article/2-vodo/132-cdm-schoon-genoeg-vlaams-en-federaal-cdm-beleid-onder-de-loep-.html|publisher=Vlaams Overleg Duurzame Ontwikkeling|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Despines"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Despines, M. |author2=Bullock, S. |author3=Childs, M. |author4=Picken, T |last-author-amp=yes |title=A dangerous distraction: Why offsets are a mistake the U.S. can't afford to make|url=http://www.foe.org/sites/default/files/A_Dangerous_Distraction_US.pdf|publisher=Friends of the Earth|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=L.|title=Is the CDM fulfilling its environmental and sustainable development objectives?

Exaggerating the carbon benefits is also a common practice, just as [[carbon leakage]]. Sometimes a company even produces more to receive more [[Certified emission reduction|CERs]].

Most of the doubtful projects are [[Clean Development Mechanism#Industrial gas projects|Industrial gas projects]]. Even though only 1.7% of all CDM-projects can be qualified as such, extraordinarily they account for half&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web |work=Reuters |date= 14 October 2011 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/14/us-carbon-price-snapanalysis-idUSTRE79D33W20111014 |title=Analysis: U.N. carbon price set to fall further |author1=Nina Chestney |author2=John McGarrity }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 69%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNEP Risø Centre|title=CDM projects grouped in types|url=http://cdmpipeline.org/cdm-projects-type.htm|publisher=CDMPipeline.org|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all CERs that have been issued, contributing to a collapse in the global market for all CERs.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; Since the cost of dismantling these gases is very low compared to the market price of the CERs, very large profits can be made by companies setting up these projects.&lt;ref name="Schneider et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=L.|author2=Lazarus, M. |author3=Kollmuss, A |title=Industrial N2O Projects Under the CDM: Adipic Acid - A Case of Carbon Leakage?|journal=Stockholm Environment Institute Working Paper WP-US-1006|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the CDM has become a stimulus for [[carbon leakage]], or even to simply produce more.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wara|first=M. W.|author2=Victor, D.

[[Clean Development Mechanism#Hydropower|Hydro-projects]] are also quite problematic. Barbara Haye calculated that more than a third of all hydro-projects recognized as a CDM-project ‘were already completed at the time of registration and almost all were already under construction’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haye|first=B.|title=Failed mechanism: How the CDM is subsidizing hydro developers and harming the Kyoto Protocol|journal=Internationalrivers.org|date=November 2007|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/Failed_Mechanism_3.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that CERs are issued for projects that aren’t additional, which again indirectly leads to higher emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Rivers|title=Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, most of the proposed carbon benefits of these projects are exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;

Why are these projects approved by the Clean_Development_Mechanism Executive Board (EB)?’, one might wonder. One of the main problems is that the EB is a highly politicized body. People taking a place in the board aren’t independent technocrats, but are elected as representatives of their respective countries. They face pressure from their own &amp; other (powerful) countries, the [[World Bank]] (that subsidizes certain projects), and other lobbying organisations. This, combined with a lack of transparency regarding the decisions of the board leads to the members favouring political-economical over technical or scientific considerations.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flues|first=F.|author2=Michaelowa, A. |author3=Michaelowa, K |title=UN approval of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects in developing countries: The political economy of the CDM Executive Board|journal=CIS Working Paper|year=2008|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that the CDM isn’t governed according to the rules of ‘[[good governance]]’. Solving this problem might require a genuine democratization in the election of the EB-members and thus a shift in thinking from government to [[environmental governance|governance]]. In practice this would mean that all the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] should get a voice in who can have a seat in the EB.

Another important factor in the dysfunctionality of the EB is the lack of time, staff and financial resources it has to fully evaluate a project proposal.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt; Moreover, the verification of a project is often outsourced to companies that also deliver services (such as accounting or consultancy) to enterprises setting up these same projects. In this way, the verifiers have serious incentives to deliver a positive report to the EB.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bachram|first=H.|title=Climate Fraud and Carbon Colonialism: The New Trade in Greenhouse Gases|journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism|year=2004|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that implementation is the place where the shoe pinches, as usually happens in environmental issues (mostly due to a lack of funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it should be noted though that there have been indications in recent years that the EB is becoming more strict in its decisions, due to the huge criticism and the board getting more experience.&lt;ref name="Flues" /&gt;

====Exclusion of forest conservation/avoided deforestation from the CDM====
The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation as well as avoided deforestation from the CDM for a variety of political, practical and ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A New Initiative to Use Carbon Trading for Tropical Forest Conservation] William F. Laurance(2007), Biotropica 39 (1), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; However, carbon emissions from deforestation represent 18-25% of all emissions,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, N. 2006. Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; and will account for more carbon emissions in the next five years than all emissions from all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025.&lt;ref&gt;Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change, Global Canopy Programme, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there have been growing calls for the inclusion of forests in CDM schemes for the second commitment period from a variety of sectors, under the leadership of the [[Coalition for Rainforest Nations]], and brought together under the [[Forests Now Declaration]], which has been signed by over 300 NGOs, business leaders, and policy makers. There is so far no international agreement about whether projects avoiding deforestation or conserving forests should be initiated through separate policies and measures or stimulated through the carbon market. One major concern is the enormous monitoring effort needed in order to make sure projects are indeed leading to increased carbon storage. There is also local opposition. For example, May 2, 2008, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues ([[UNPFII]]), Indigenous leaders from around the world protested against the [[Clean Energy Mechanism]]s, especially against [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]].

====Reasons for including avoided deforestation projects in the CDM====

''Combating global warming has broadly two components: decreasing the release of greenhouse gases and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emitters, such as coal-fired power plants, are known as "sources", and places where carbon and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can be sequestered, i.e. kept out of the atmosphere, are known as "sinks".

The world's forests, particularly rain forests, are important carbon sinks, both because of their uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through photosynthesis and because of the amount of carbon stored in their woody biomass and the soil. When rain forests are logged and burned, not only do we lose the forests' capacity to take up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, but also the carbon stored in that biomass and soil is released into the atmosphere through release of roots from the soil and the burning of the woody plant matter.

An emerging proposal, Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), would allow rain forest preservation to qualify for CDM project status. [[REDD]] has gained support through recent meetings of the COP, and will be examined at Copenhagen.

====Coal thermal power generation in India and China====
In July 2011, Reuters reported that a 4,000 MW coal thermal electricity generation plant in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh had been registered with the CDM. CDM Watch and the Sierra Club criticised the plant's registration and its eligibility for certified emission reduction units as clearly not additional. A CDM spokesperson dismissed these claims. According to information provided to Reuters, there are total of five coal-fired electricity plants registered with the CDM, four in India with a capacity of 10,640 MW and one 2,000 MW plant in China. The five plants are eligible to receive 68.2 million CERs over a 10-year period with an estimated value of 661 million euros ($919 million) at a CER price of 9.70 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2012, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism adopted rules confirming that new coal thermal power generation plants could be registered as CDM projects and could use the simplified rules called 'Programmes of Activities'. The organisation CDM-Watch described the decision as inconsistent with the objective of the CDM as it subsidised the construction of new coal power plants. CDM-Watch described the CERs that would be issued as "non-additional dirty carbon credits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrial gas projects====

Some CERs are produced from CDM projects at refrigerant-producing factories in non-Annex I countries that generate the powerful greenhouse gas HFC 23 as a by-product. These projects dominated the CDM's early growth, and are expected to generate 20% of all credited emission reductions by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Paying for facilities to destroy HFC-23 can cost only 0.2-0.5&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Industrialized countries were, however, paying around 20 €/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for reductions that cost below 1&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This provoked strong criticism.

The scale of profits generated by HFC-23 projects threatened distortions in competitiveness with plants in industrialized countries that had already cleaned up their emissions (p.&amp;nbsp;60). In an attempt to address concerns over HFC-23 projects, the CDM Executive Board made changes in how these projects are credited. According to the Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60), these changes effectively ensure that:
*the potential to capture emissions from these plants is exploited;
*distortions are reduced;
*and the risk of perverse incentives is capped.

Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60) argued that criticizing the CDM for finding low-cost reductions seemed perverse. They also argued that addressing the problem with targeted funding was easy with hindsight, and that before the CDM, these emission reduction opportunities were not taken.

====Hydropower====

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

NGOs have criticized the inclusion of large [[hydropower]] projects, which they consider unsustainable, as CDM projects.{https://www.internationalrivers.org/km/taxonomy/term/1024} Lately, both the CDM EB and investors have become concerned about such projects for potential lack of additionality. One reason was that many of these projects had started well before applying for CDM status. In June 2008, third party validator TÜV SÜD Group rejected a hydropower project in China because the project proponents could not document that they had seriously considered CDM at the time the project was started. In July 2008, third party validators agreed that projects applying for CDM status more than one year after having taken their investment decision should not qualify for CDM status.  Currently, the largest power plant to receive CDM registration is the [[Jirau Dam|Jirau Hydroelectric Plant]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's Jirau hydro project world's largest CDM-registered renewable plant|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/06/brazil-s-jirau-hydro-project-world-s-largest-cdm-registered-rene.html|work=Hydro World|accessdate=30 Dec 2014|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower projects larger than 20&amp;nbsp;MW must document that they follow [[World Commission on Dams]] guidelines or similar guidelines in order to qualify for the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=requires a citation}} As of 21 July 2008, CERs from hydropower projects are not listed on European carbon exchanges, because different member states interpret these limitations differently.

Organisation seeking to measure the degree of compliance of individual projects with WCD principles can use the [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]], recommended as the most practical currently available evaluation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 17517IIED: Watered Down?

====Other concerns====

'''Renewable energy'''

In the initial phase of the CDM, policy makers and NGOs were concerned about the lack of renewable energy CDM projects. As the new CDM projects are now predominantly renewables and energy efficiency projects, this is now less of an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/State&amp;Trendsformatted06May10pm.pdf|title=World Bank, State and Trends of the Carbon Market, 2010|author=|date=|website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinks'''

NGOs, as well as several governments, have consistently been sceptical towards the inclusion of [[Carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] as CDM projects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=this needs a citation}} The main reasons were fear of oversupply, that such projects cannot guarantee permanent storage of carbon, and that the methods of accounting for carbon storage in biomass are complex and still under development. Consequently, two separate carbon currencies (temporary CERs and long-term CERs) were created for such projects. Such credits cannot be imported to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. The lack of demand for such projects have resulted in very limited supply: Currently (21 July 2008), only one sinks project has been registered under CDM.

'''Windfarms in Western Sahara'''

In 2012, it was announced, that a windfarm complex is going to be located near [[Laayoune]], the capital city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Since this project is to be established under tight collaboration between the UN (which itself recognizes Western Sahara's status of a non-autonomous country) and the Moroccan government, it has been questioned by many parties supporting Western Sahara independence, including the [[Polisario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsrw.org/a105x2329|title=WSRW requests UN to refrain from paying for Moroccan King in Sahara - wsrw.org|first=Western Sahara Resource|last=Watch|date=|website=www.wsrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suggestions====

In response to concerns of unsustainable projects or spurious credits, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and other NGOs devised a ‘Gold Standard’ methodology to certify projects that uses much stricter criteria than required, such as allowing only renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmgoldstandard.org/|title=The Gold Standard|author=|date=|website=www.cdmgoldstandard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[South Africa]]n brick kiln was faced with a business decision; replace its depleted energy supply with coal from a new [[Coal mine|mine]], or build a difficult but cleaner [[natural gas]] pipeline to another country. They chose to build the pipeline with [[Sasol|SASOL]]. SASOL claimed the difference in GHG emissions as a CDM credit, comparing emissions from the pipeline to the contemplated coal mine.
During its approval process, the validators noted that changing the supply from coal to gas met the CDM's 'additionality' criteria and was the least cost-effective option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/UserManagement/FileStorage/S790NBBTEMPHOKU95G4UB8J0U5V52O CDM Project 0177 Lawley Fuel Switch Project] UNFCCC&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there were unofficial reports that the fuel change was going to take place anyway, although this was later denied by the company's press office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;Itemid=36&amp;id=177&amp;task=view|title=Trading the Absurd - carbon trade watch|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.carbontradewatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successes===

Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;73) commented on the success of the CDM in reducing emissions from industrial plants and landfills.&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt; Schneider (2007) concluded by stating that if concerns over the CDM are properly addressed, it would continue to be an "important instrument in the fight against climate change."

A '''commissioned survey''' is a kind of archaeological and social survey performed in return for money or goods. Typically, these surveys were conducted in the pre [[Colony|colonial Era]], as part of Age of European Enlightenment to study territories before colonization. They would usually extend to significant and detailed efforts by trading companies to study institutions of indigenous communities as a precursor to colonial powers exerting colonial supremacy. An example would be when soldiers of [[East India Company]] were paid fees to study exotic lands, customs, cultures and literatures of the colonized world. The end product of a commissioned survey would usually be a report or book in a [[Languages of Europe|European language]], which could form a basis for [[Law|law making]] by colonial powers.

==Inks and pigments==

The best distinction between inks and pigments is that ink is a colored liquid while pigments are colored particles suspended in a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Kunjappu, Joy (March 2003). [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/March/inkchemistry.asp ”Ink Chemistry.”]. Chemistry World. rsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas colored by pigments usually have multiple layers of pigments and other mediums.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The most important aspect of preserving pigments and inks is to identify their composition.  Some techniques are not suitable for certain pigments and will do further harm.&lt;ref name="utexas1"&gt;[http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/pdfs/a-baker-04-pigments.pdf Common Medieval Pigments.]. (PDF). Retrieved on 2012-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some examples of issues with pigments===

*[[Iron gall ink]] – very popular black ink; corrosive; can become brittle and fade.&lt;ref&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/ 15, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lead white – darkens when exposed to air; reacts with verdigris and orpiment; generally stable to light.
*[[Orpiment]] – loses color quickly with exposure to [[ozone]]; decays slowly in water; dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]; reacts with lead- and copper-based pigments (such as lead white and verdigris); can corrode bindings; will not easily adhere to parchment and tend to flake off; cannot readily be consolidated with gelatin.

===Identification===

Identifying specific pigments is no easy task.  Descriptions may be wrong or misleading and choosing the wrong treatment may cause irreversible damage.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Brown, Michelle P. “Pigments and their Uses in Insular Manuscripts”, in: ''Roger Powell: The Compleat Binder''; edited by John L. Sharpe. (Bibliologia; 14: Elementa ad librorum studia pertenentia''), 1996, pp. 136–45 {{ISBN|2503504345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different ways to identify pigments: invasive and non-invasive.

;Invasive
These tests alter the manuscript in some way, usually by removing some pigment to test a sample.  They are generally reliable but results are not always clear.&lt;ref name="utexas1"/&gt;

;Non-Invasive

These tests do not alter the manuscript and are much better for conservation purposes than the invasive methods of identification.  Some methods include:

*[[Microscopes]]
*Observation under [[Ultra violet|UV]], [[Infrared|IR]], and [[visible light]]
*[[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence (XRF)]]
*[[PIXE|Particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE-α)]]
*[[Raman spectroscopy]]

;Raman spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy analyzes the [[molecular vibration]]s of the pigments and uses this data to map out its chemical makeup.&lt;ref &lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This works on the notion that every substance interacts with radiation in different ways, and these differing ways if measured can help identify the substance without having to take a sample. Unlike other non-invasive identification techniques the results of Raman spectroscopy are much more certain.  It is even possible to analyze a pigment beneath a glaze or other treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638581|title=Laser Raman Spectroscopy: a tool for non-destructive pigment analysis of manuscripts|year=1992|last1=Porter|first1=Cheryl|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of parchment==

Parchment is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic.]]  As such, environmental conditions such as [[relative humidity|humidity]] must be kept under control.  Pigments add another layer to the problem, forcing a preservationist to fit environmental conditions to two different (and possibly conflicting) sets of ideal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638571|title=Rediscovering Parchment: the nature of the beast|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems can occur when parchment is exposed to high humidity for a long period of time. For example, [[collagen]] in the pages could dissolve and stick together.&lt;ref&gt;Mowery, J. Franklin. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/bp10-12.html “The Conservation of a Thirteenth Century Armenian Manuscript.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ''The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL''] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/ 10, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are further compounded by the fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.  Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a relief effect to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638576|title=The Vellum of the Book of Kells|year=1992|last1=Cains|first1=Anthony|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition.  There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as [[Perspex]]) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638579|title=Alternative Methods of Mounting Parchment for Framing and Exhibition|year=1992|last1=Pickwoad|first1=Nicholas|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of repair==

===Consolidation===

Consolidation is a process that can either strengthen the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from [[aqueous]] treatments.  Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away.  The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Maheux, Anne F., and Wanda McWilliams. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-03.html “The Use of the Ultrasonic Mister for the Consolidation of a Flaking Gouache Painting on Paper.] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/ 14, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble [[nylon]] was used until the mid-1970s when concerns over the material’s stability emerged.  Parchment size was then favored until the mid-1990s when leaf [[gelatin]] gained popularity.  This is not to say that gelatin is always the best consolidant to use; no consolidation technique should be used without first considering the pigments and other materials involved, though.  For example, gelatin causes white lead to become [[friability|friable.]]  This problem is compounded by the flexible nature of parchment.  One solution to this particular problem is to use some form of a cellulose ether such as [[methylcellulose]], instead of gelatin.  Again, this is not necessarily the right choice for every situation.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

There are a few basic requirements for any consolidation agent:
*It has to cause a strong bond to form between the pigment and parchment;
*A strong bond also has to be formed between the layers of pigments and any loose particles;
*There has to be little alteration of the chemicals, including appearance;
*It cannot cause the parchment to lose flexibility.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

====Ultrasonic mister====

One device recently used in consolidation techniques is the ultrasonic mister.  Created in 1991 by Stefan Michalski, this device lends itself well to consolidating materials that react badly with liquids.  Gelatin is the preferred consolidant.

The ultrasonic mister is usually used in conjunction with a paper suction table to direct the mist at the media and prevent [[distortion]].  This is not the best treatment for illuminated manuscripts that have printing on both sides, though.  In this case it is better to forgo the suction table and instead use the lowest setting on the mister and to monitor the process carefully.

Problems may arise if condensed mist falls onto the parchment from the nozzle so it is advisable that the device be placed on the floor or a similarly low level to coax mist to drain back into the mister instead of falling upon the parchment.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Flattening and crease removal===

Traditional methods of removing creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been detrimental to the state of any pigments, causing them to come off the parchment slightly.  This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, causing them to expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface.  This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638572|title=A Conditioning Chamber for Parchment and Other Materials|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gore-Tex===

The question becomes whether flattening creased parchment to some extent will cause more or less damage to the image than would be caused by not removing the crease.  Sometimes not flattening the parchment in some respect will lead to the further degradation of an image.  In these cases some form of hydration is necessary.  Due to the nature of pigments, though, it is desirable to avoid direct contact with liquid water.  This can be accomplished with [[Gore-Tex]].

Gore-Tex now has controllable pore size and can block out many liquids, including liquid water and many conservation chemicals.  Water vapor can still pass through the pores, though, so it is possible to hydrate the parchment and remove a crease without introducing liquid water to the pigmented image.  This can be achieved by sandwiching a manuscript in Gore-Tex in varying ways to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=The Conservation of Parchment Objects Using Gore-Tex Laminate|year=1992|last1=Singer|first1=Hannah|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===

Repairing a tear in a parchment with images or text on it is more of a challenge than mending a piece of parchment that does not have any such issues.  Care must be taken to not cover up or obscure in any way the image or the text.  Materials such as [[Goldbeater's skin]] can be made transparent enough to do this but great care still needs to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1995.9638409|title=Leafcasting with Dermal Tissue Preparations: a new method for repairing fragile parchment, and its application to the Codex Eyckensis|year=1995|last1=Wouters|first1=Jan|last2=Peckstadt|first2=An|last3=Watteeuw|first3=Lieve|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=19|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The ethics of illuminated manuscript preservation involve the potential for adversely altering the source material during the course of the repair work. In order to ensure the integrity of the manuscript, great care must be taken during any preservation activity. Risk assessments should be made to determine the potential impact of preservation work on the manuscript, and weigh that against the potential benefits of the restoration work itself.

==In Depth on Conservation Challenges==
The Illuminated Book: Conserving an Art Form

The term illuminated manuscript comes from two sources, both of which originated in Medieval Latin.  The first is manuscriptus, a combination of manu ‘by hand’ and scriptus ‘written’.  The second is the Latin word illuminare, which translates to ‘adorned’.  It is this second term that immediately catches attention, letting readers know that this particular manuscript is special, illuminated or ‘adorned.’  An illuminated manuscript is a book, usually religious in nature, that has been intricately decorated with paints, inks, and metal leaf such as gold and silver.  This can include full page illustrations, intricate initials at the beginning of paragraphs and chapters, and embellishment to particularly important areas of text.  A surprising number of these books have survived the years to exist in the modern era; mostly thanks to their value and, in many cases, religious significance.  Nonetheless, the very embellishments that allowed these books to survive are the reason that today’s conservators find illuminated manuscripts more challenging to maintain than their plain counterparts.  This is important not just to conservators, but to the historians who rely on them to trace the economic trends and artistic evolution in a time that is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, or more properly known as the Migration Period (476–800 C.E.).  Thousands of illuminated manuscripts have survived the ages, yet many are slowly being lost today because they are not being properly conserved.  Illuminated manuscripts are some of the hardest books to conserve, but every effort must be made to preserve them not only for their own beauty and value but for their historical significance as some of the only surviving written records of an era.

Part of the complexity of illuminated manuscripts lies in their historical context.  An illuminated manuscript is, in simple terms, a decorated book.  They usually contain both painted illustrations, embellished text, and illumination with gold and other precious metals.  With the advent and propagation of Christianity in medieval Europe, illustrated books rapidly became a way to convey religious teachings in a time when most of the population was illiterate.  Because of this purpose, most of the illuminated manuscripts to have survived the ages are religious in nature.  In most cases, rich patrons or churches would commission the creation of their own copies of various religious scriptures.  These were most commonly complete copies of the Bible or a subsection, such as individual books of the Old Testament, collections of 150 psalms, or collections of the first four books of the New Testament (Anderson 9).  In later cases, when more people could read, books of hours were also widely called for.   All of these books were created by either nuns or monks, usually in a scriptorium connected to their church or abbey.  Outside of the church, there were some examples of secular texts being illuminated.  Astronomical treatises and copies of classical writers were some of the first examples, emerging as the trend of owning personal copies of religious texts spread among the wealthy.  Later, histories and chronicles became more popular, coinciding with the gradual spread of knowledge and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the latter part of the Middle Ages (Anderson 13).  These books were still most often produced by church scribes and illuminators; however, they were commissioned by private citizens or universities rather than the church.  Without the illuminated manuscripts historians have to study today, much of this information about the gradual return of wealth and learning in the Migration Period would be difficult or even impossible to accurately trace and date.
There were many reasons for the creation of illuminated manuscripts, and these varied with each commission.  However, the most common were either for teaching purposes or as shows of wealth.  Because most common people were illiterate, they could only relate to stories of church doctrine through pictures rather than reading the words.  Illustrating religious texts allowed people to see the stories that church leaders read to them, and to create a personal connection outside of the oral tradition.  In this instance, illuminated manuscripts served the same purpose as stained glass windows in churches.  They allowed the faithful to see the stories of their faith, lending them substance that might be absent from the spoken word.  They could also serve as reminders of religious faith when a church service was not in progress.  The second reason for the creation of illuminated manuscripts was as a show of wealth.  In the case of church manuscripts, the books could both tell religious stories and remind the people of the power and wealth of the church.  In the case of private commissions, the patron was able to demonstrate their wealth by purchasing lavish volumes for their personal libraries and chapels.  This also served to demonstrate their fidelity to and strengthen their ties with the church, whose support and influence with the common people played a major part in keeping the upper class in power.  Because all but the very smallest of local churches had at least a plain copy of the bible, the range from completely unadorned manuscripts to the lavish and intricate designs embellished with rich gold leaf seen in the more famous versions of the art are clearly represented.  Where each book fell on this range closely reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, whether that was an upper-class individual or a town.  While this influence is also represented in buildings and other archeological evidence such as coinage and works of art, the prevalence of illuminated manuscripts from different areas and time periods provides a sort of historical litmus test to the prosperity of the region.

Before the invention of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process.  The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the binding threads were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle.  Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe.  Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press.  The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D.  The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet.  These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse.  They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17).  Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications.  Over time, they became the standard form of written information.  Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves.  Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7).  

To understand the challenges conservators face when dealing with these intricately decorated books, it is first necessary to understand how they were made.  Bookbinders used some of the same techniques used today to create hand bound books.  Sheets were folded in half, so that each one would form two pages.  These were then nested one inside the other to create a gathering.  These gatherings could include as many pages as the bookbinder chose, however there were usually relatively few to prevent the gathering from becoming too bulky.  An alternative method was to fold a very large sheet of paper repeatedly to create many pages, then slit three of the four sides with a knife to create a sheaf of pages (Hamel 39).  Many gatherings were sown together though pre-punched holes known as sowing stations.  The pattern of sowing stations and the use of the thread was what determined the structure of the binding.  Because scribes and artists often needed access to the entire sheets of paper to do their work, books from this time period were often prepared in loose bindings that could be easily undone to free a sheet of paper (Hamel 40).  For both illuminated and unadorned books, these loose bindings cause problems for conservators when they have not been properly and firmly bound after the writing and decorating was completed.  Entire gatherings of pages can come loose, needing to be carefully re-stitched into their correct locations.  Because of the wide variance in materials used in the bindings of books from the era that illuminated manuscripts were made, it is possible to trace some back to specific binderies, meaning that the materials can be analyzed to understand what trade was going on in that area at the time.  For example, if a lavish cover was inlayed with lapis lazuli, if would be possible to infer that the bindery was able to source materials from as far east as Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Certain kinds of leather can also be traced back to specific geographical regions, as some breeds of cow and goat were only found in specific areas at this time.

The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns.  There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35).  Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure.  Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts.  As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark.  However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11).  It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time.  This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper.  Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts.  Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible.  The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44).  Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35).  This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts.  The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history.  There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: if is very susceptible to water damage.  Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace.  It is believed that “Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,” however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).

The issue of proper inks used on parchment also carries over to the paints used in the illustrations.  This set of problems is truly unique to decorated books, and is the beginning of just what sets them apart as conservation challenges as opposed to their plain counterparts.  In particular, the brilliant blue color of paint that is seen in many of the finest examples of the art is a challenge.  Made from ground lapis lazuli this was the most expensive color of paint, as it was sourced from far away Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Any book bearing this color would have been especially costly, and helps to map the economic structure of Migration Period Europe through the supply chain used to create it and the person wealthy enough to afford it.  Unfortunately, this particularly precious color is also the most difficult for conservators.  It is prone to flaking and cupping, a form of contraction which causes the paint to crack and curve outwards in many little flakes, giving the appearance of tiny shingles that have been flipped upside-down.  This means that even the slightest friction can catch the raised edges and cause the paint to flake off.  It must be carefully consolidated with a nonreactive adhesive, without damaging other surrounding decoration (Clarkson 47).  Many other paints used at the time were also poisonous.  The compositions of many paints were discovered using Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive method of analysis that bounces light off of a given pigment and reads back the compositions based on witch wavelengths are absorbed and reflected (De 75).  Using this and other spectroscopic methods, it has been determined that the very common red pigment found in these books was created from red lead, or, more dangerously, the highly toxic compound cinnabar.  Another variant of this common color was vermillion, created using heated mercury and sulfur.  Yellow was often made using poisonous orpiment, or arsenic sulfide, and white was almost invariably created using lead.  While there are some organic alternatives, such as yellow made from saffron, it is unknown if even a single illuminated manuscript does not contain toxic materials.  These compounds can pose a danger to conservators, researchers, or those putting the books of display if they are aerated and should be carefully consolidated and never abraded.  While many other paints and inks were used by the artist decorating the books, these examples convey both the wide ranges of the colors used and the dangers they posed. This added level of difficulty is a good example of what makes illuminated manuscripts harder to deal with than plan books.  It is also worth noting that while the paints were a finishing measure for the book the painter did not actually do any designing.  An earlier drawling would have set out the pattern and clearly labeled with colors should go where in places that would be covered with paint.  These patterns and labels are visible using various imaging techniques.  Some scribes also wrote or made small drawings in the margins of the books, often providing historians with a window into the life on the average man in the Migration Period. These little annotations are some of the only surviving records of everyday life from the time commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Complaints about long work hours and little drawings of people and monsters can be seen both in the margins and in some cases under the paint of the illustrations.  

The tradition of illustrating texts goes all the way back to the cradle of civilization, evolving through Egypt and the cultures of the Mediterranean.  However, it was far less common for books and papers to be embellished with precious metals, and this aspect of illuminated manuscripts adds another facet of difficulty for conservators that is not found elsewhere.  In the middle ages, gold was the symbol of royalty, a clear sign of wealth and status.  Yet for all of that, it was actually fairly common.  Indeed, by the late middle ages the most common use for gold was in coinage (De 65).  Because of this, using small quantities of the precious metal in a book was not prohibitively expensive.  Gold, and all other metals used for illumination, was hammered into incredibly thin sheets, allowing a tiny amount of gold to cover a large area.  This thin sheet was then adhered to the pages using the particular illuminator’s formula of adhesive.  This variation in adhesives mean that if any work needs to be done by a conservator, several tests must be undergone to ensure that no modern consolidation or adhesive will react with, damage, or loosen the old glue.  While this is an issue for conservators, in rare cases a glue can be traced to a specific bindery, thus placing the book in its correct area and context, making it far more useful to historians.  Another challenge for conservators lies in the fact that the gold used in books was not always pure.  Alloys of gold can be subject to corrosion, with can cause darkening of the metal, reaction with the adhesives and other paint, and staining of the paper.  This is an inherent vice of illuminations done with pure silver as well.  Regardless of the care and treatment, silver corrodes and darkens over time.  While modern conservators have ways of limiting this though control of humidity, older books have often seen their illumination corrode to the point that to attempt to clean it would simply remove the metal entirely.

Conservation in the modern era does not only face issues with the objects themselves.  While a corroded book is one issue, how to display that book to the public is another, potentially more complex problem.  From a conservator’s point of view, to best protect a book it should be placed in a controlled, dark environment, then swaddled in padding with plenty of circulating air and tightly controlled relative humidity.  Once old damage has been repaired, the goal is to keep new damage from occurring.  However, most illuminated manuscripts belong to museums and libraries.  Moreover, these beautiful works are the pride of the collection in most cases, and any curator will naturally want their most enticing items on display to woo the visiting public.  In addition, part of the cultural value of the books is what they can teach us about the missing part of history commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Historians will often want to study and run tests on the books in hopes of learning something about the time and place they were made, such as what trade was present.  Thus comes one of the great ethical issues in the field of conservation, the problem of preservation versus access.  The question most often faced by conservators is how to display a book to the least damage for the longest time.  The light that enables visitors to see the books also breaks down the lignin structures in paper pages, fades paints, and embrittles leather.  The cradle that holds the book open for viewing may also strain the spine. These are only two of the myriad issues that must be addressed when dealing with these fragile books.  Even more arise when tests need to be run or a historian wants to handle a book.  Removing a sliver of paint for analysis by a mass spectrometer may reveal information about trade routes, but it also damages the book.  Likewise, inspecting the drawings and inscriptions in the margins provides a unique historical window, but a careless historian might touch the page and damage fragile and flaking paint.  Not all institutions have the funds to properly care for their collections either.  While a few famous examples claim the spotlight in major institutions, small museums, libraries, and religious centers put their own, smaller treasures on display to the public without the expertise of a conservator to aid them.

The complex challenges of illuminated manuscripts make them a uniquely troublesome medium for conservation.  Their illumination, adhesives, paints, inks, papers, and even their very bindings can pose issues ranging from toxic chemicals to lost pages.  Some of these issues are universal to book conservation.  The troubles with ink on parchment pages and of loose bindings can be found in any book contemporary to the Medieval and Migration Periods.  Yet illuminated manuscripts take these usual issues and add to them with poisonous paint, corroding metals, and uniquely challenging materials such as the luxuriously expensive yet eternally flaking lapis lazuli paint.  Illuminated manuscripts are also problematic because of their popularity amongst displays.  For these reasons and many others, illuminated manuscripts are clearly more challenging to conservators than their plainer contemporaries.  Hidden away in private collections and small institutions, some of these books are gradually falling into disrepair.  This fact is all the more important when you look past the aesthetic and monetary value of these books and realize that they are some of the only surviving written pieces from a time when there is so little historical information available that textbooks call it the Dark Ages.  In the future, as technology evolves, it may be possible to gradually bring the economy and social system of the Migration Period into the light by carefully analyzing these books.  This is why it is so important that they survive in the modern age; and why the difficulty of their care matters to everyone, weather they see a beautiful artwork or a historical road map in the glittering pages.
 
==Digital preservation==

'''Cumberland College''' in [[Princeton, Kentucky]], was founded in 1826 and operated until 1861. It was the first college affiliated with the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]. In 1842, the Cumberland Presbyterian denomination withdrew its support from Cumberland College in favor of [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. In doing so, the denomination intended to simply relocate the school from Princeton to Lebanon, but Cumberland College remained open without denominational support until the Civil War.

==Founding and early years==
On October 22, 1825, Cumberland Synod, the ruling judicatory of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, resolved to establish a college somewhere in southwestern Kentucky. The school's primary purpose was to educate young men who wanted to become ministers, but the school would be open to all. The school would also require students to perform manual labor for two to three hours a day. The synod appointed a commission to determine a site for the college.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission considered four towns in Kentucky ([[Hopkinsville]], [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]], [[Elkton, Kentucky|Elkton]], and Princeton) and finally chose Princeton on January 13, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission hired [[Franceway Ranna Cossitt|Franceway R. Cossitt]], a Cumberland Presbyterian minister, as the college's president and sole teacher. Classes first began on March 1, 1826. By the end of the year, the college had about sixty students and had hired another teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the college was named, as the synod had resolved, the Cumberland Presbyterian College. However, when the synod requested a charter for the college, members of the Kentucky legislature worried that the original name would stoke sectarian conflict. The legislature therefore dropped "Presbyterian" from the name and issued a charter to Cumberland College on January 8, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumberland College was part of a larger [[Manual labor school|manual labor movement]], as other schools like the [[Oneida Institute]] and [[Oberlin College]] required students to perform physical labor in addition to their study.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman.&lt;/ref&gt; The synod hoped that manual labor would prevent students from sacrificing "bodily vigor" at the expense of "mental energy."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gore 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The college had a working farm, and students worked on the farm two hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830 the college became home to the first Cumberland Presbyterian newspaper, the ''Religious and Literary Intelligencer''. The paper's editor moved to Nashville in 1832 and changed the paper's name to the ''Revivalist''; two years later, it was renamed the ''Cumberland Presbyterian'', and eventually became the denominational organ.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation and final years==
The college's largest problem was its indebtedness. The synodical commission had chosen Princeton as the college's site on the strength of local pledges of support amounting to at least $15,000, but few of the pledges were upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 11, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1837 the college was $12,000 in debt, and five years later it was still indebted more than $5,600.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 44, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1842, the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (now the denomination's highest judicatory) responded to the college's indebtedness by appointing a commission to decide whether to relocate the college, and if so where. The commission met in July and decided to relocate the college to Lebanon, Tennessee, whose backers offered $10,000 in cash. Neither the commission nor the General Assembly had the authority to dissolve Cumberland College or to relocate it outside Kentucky. The General Assembly did, however, cease its financial support for the Princeton college and allocated educational funds to the Lebanon college. Also, Franceway Cossitt left the Princeton college to become the Lebanon college's first president. The Lebanon school opened in October 1842. Though it was originally named Cumberland College, it was chartered as Cumberland University on December 30, 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The college in Princeton, Kentucky, remained open. The college ceased its manual labor operations and sold off its farm and farm equipment. By the end of 1842, the college was, for the first time in its history, debt-free.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1844, Green River Synod (an intermediate judicatory of the denomination) agreed to sponsor the college now that the General Assembly no longer sponsored it.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumberland College remained viable until the height of the secession crisis. The college's last class graduated in the fall of 1860, and the college's board of trustees sold off the property.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, wrote a Cumberland Presbyterian historian, "every vestige even of the old buildings" had "disappeared."&lt;ref&gt;McDonnold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qtFLAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mcdonnold+cumberland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=III-VJWSHqa28wGr44HYDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vestige&amp;f=false p. 228].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cemetery and historic marker==
The college's cemetery can be found on a private, residential yard on Traylor Street near Calvary Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;Gore 2010, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Attributes of God}}

In [[theology]], '''divine providence''', or just '''providence''', is [[God]]'s intervention in the [[Universe]]. The term ''Divine Providence'' (usually capitalized) is also used as a [[names of God|title of God]]. A distinction is usually made between "general providence", which refers to God's [[God the Sustainer|continuous upholding]] of the existence and [[natural law|natural order]] of the Universe, and "special providence", which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Providence.aspx#1O101-Providence |title=Providence |work=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |date= |access-date=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miracle]]s generally fall in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Providence, and Miracle |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/creation-providence-and-miracle |publisher=[[Reasonable Faith]] |access-date=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin ''providentia'' "foresight, [[prudence]]", from ''pro-'' "ahead" and ''videre'' "to see". The current use of the word has the sense of "knowledge of the future" or [[omniscience]], understood as an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute of God]].

==Catholic theology==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] is perhaps most famously associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that since God's governance takes place in the universe comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end, this implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm Walker, Leslie. "Divine Providence." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Christian teaching on providence in the [[High Middle Ages]] was most fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the [[universe]], his foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern [[Thomism|Thomists]]. One of the foremost modern Thomists, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] father [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], wrote a study of providence entitled "Providence: God's loving care for man and the need for confidence in Almighty God." In it, he presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to providence.

==Reformed theology==
{{See also|Reformed theology}}
This term is an integral part of [[John Calvin]]'s theological framework known as [[Calvinism]], which emphasizes the [[total depravity]] of man and the complete sovereignty of God. God's plan for the world and every soul that he has created is guided by his will, or providence. According to Calvin, the idea that man has [[free will]] and is able to make choices independently of what God has already determined is based on our limited understanding of God's perfection and the idea that God's purposes can be circumvented. In this mode of thought, providence is related to absolute free will. This concept remains prominent among many [[Protestant]] denominations that identify with Calvinism, the [[Reformed churches]].

==Lutheran theology==
{{See also|Lutheranism}}
In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theology, divine providence refers to God's preservation of [[ex nihilo|creation]], his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House. 1934. pp. 189-195 and Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 635 and [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=P&amp;word=PROVIDENCE Christian Cyclopedia] article on Divine Providence.

God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Steven P.,''Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess''. Wipf and Stock. 2005. pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House: 1934. pp. 190 and Edward. W. A.,''A Short Explanation of Dr. Martin Luther's Small Catechism''. Concordia Publishing House. 1946. p. 165. and [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 Divine Providence and Human Adversity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707130929/http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 |date=2010-07-07 }} by Markus O. Koepsell&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Luther]], divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and [[natural laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/luthersworksvolu009862mbp Luther's Works Vol. 1 Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1-5] page 25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Luther's Small Catechism]], the explanation of the first article of the [[Apostles' Creed]] declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#creed |title=Luther's Small Catechism, The Apostle's Creed |publisher=Bookofconcord.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the services others provide us through family, [[government]], and work, he writes, "we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God."&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/3_tencommandments.html Luther's Large Catechism, First Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox theology==
The doctrine of providence in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is set out by St [[John of Tobolsk]]:
"St. John Damascene describes it thus: 'Providence is Divine will which maintains everything and wisely rules over everything' ... It was not by chance that the iniquitous Israeli King Ahab was struck by an arrow that flew in between the seams of his armor. Truly that arrow was directed by the hand of God, just as was the one which struck Julian the Apostate; only for the soldier who let fly the arrow was it accidental. It was not by chance that swallows flew into the home of Tobit and blinded the righteous man. This happened at God’s command, in order to hold Tobit up as an example to succeeding generations, as we learn from the Angel who accompanied his son Tobias. Nothing happens by chance. It was not by chance that Caesar Augustus ordered the census to be taken in the year of Christ’s Nativity. It was not by chance that Christ met with the Samaritan woman at the well in Sychar and spoke with her. All this was foreseen and written down in the books of Divine Providence before the beginning of time.”&lt;ref&gt;http://livingorthodoxfaith.blogspot.co.za/2009/11/divine-providence-by-st-john-of-tobolsk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedenborgian theology==
{{See also|The New Church}}
''Divine Providence'' is a book published by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in 1764 which describes his [[systematic theology]] regarding providence, free will, [[theodicy]], and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg's theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is 'foresight', and relative to the Lord is 'providence'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Warren, Compendium of Swedenborg's Theological Writings, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. Divine Providence, note 71-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Jewish thought==
{{Main|Divine providence (Judaism)}}
Divine providence ({{lang-he-n|השגחה פרטית}} ''Hashgochoh Protis'' / ''Hashgachah Pratit'' lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout [[Rabbinic literature]], and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of [[Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[world view]], particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.

==LDS theology==
There is little theological literature on the terms '''provenance''' or '''providence''' in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term. 

One particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind. &lt;blockquote&gt;And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng|title=Abraham 3|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The "making of rulers" above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to "predestination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/12/i-have-a-question?lang=eng|title=I Have a Question - Ensign Dec. 1990 - ensign|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against Divine intervenion. Noted LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church's position thusly, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects the belief in predestination-that God predetermines the salvation or the damnation of every individual ... The LDS position is based in part on the teachings of Paul that God "will render to every man according to his deeds" and that "there is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:6, 11). These two principles provide a basis for understanding Paul's use of the term "predestination." The term apparently connoted "to be ordained beforehand for godly labor." In the sense that one's potential or calling has been recognized and declared, this interpretation conforms with the Greek term Paul used, ''proorizo'', and does not denote an irreversible or irresistible predetermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Predestination|title=Predestination - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not imply a passive God. In fact, LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In its more recent General Conferences of the church, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, clearly articulates this, "Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/by-divine-design?lang=eng|title=By Divine Design - By Elder Ronald A. Rasband|last=Rasband|first=By Elder Ronald A.|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng|title=1 Nephi 4|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lds.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, "Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by “divine design”?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the text itself limits the interaction of the Divine to the "Spirit" to commanding Nephi to "Slay him."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to note, though, that God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.24-25?lang=eng#23|title=Helaman 4|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rasband concludes that, "When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father’s “divine design.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==

===Text of Scripture===
Those who believe in the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the original [[biblical manuscript]]s often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God "divinely inspired the text," so he has also "divinely preserved it throughout the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/weil-inerrancy.shtml |title=Inerrancy and its Implications for Authority: Textual Critical Considerations in Formulating an Evangelical Doctrine of Scripture |journal=[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] states that the Scriptures, "being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical."&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], I.viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important argument in the [[King James Only movement|King James Only]] debates. [[Edward F. Hills]] argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed [[Textus Receptus]] must be the closest text to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[autograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic drama''' expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of [[middle-class|middle or lower classes]] in a certain society, generally referring to the post-[[Renaissance]] eras. According to the ''English Communications Syllabus'', domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.” 

==Roots==
Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” [[Drama]] receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab

==Development and History==
Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line.&lt;ref&gt;{{answers.com|drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the early ages of [[Greek drama]], there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). [[Medieval theatre]] tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of [[morality play]]s, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama.
[[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]] marks the arrival of [[pastoral drama]], drama referring to the relationships of the [[peasant|rustics]]. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the [[romantic relationship]]s of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the [[comedic]] aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional [[comedy|comedies]] and [[tragedy|tragedies]], enforcing the further development into domestic drama.

Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the [[upper class]]es. This era also consisted of the [[Restoration drama]] and placed an emphasis on the usage of [[poetry|poetic language]], “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around [[Fictional character|character]]s' relationships and their actions towards each other.

The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental [[bourgeois]] realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class [[morality]]. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts.

[[Image:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.]]Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] into drama, thus resulting in more serious and [[philosophical]] drama. Characters and [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was [[Henrik Ibsen]] of [[Norway]]. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works.

The twentieth century introduced [[symbol]]ism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such [[psychological device]]s as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com
section 8 paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the [[illusion]]s and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of a show.

Modern dramas usually revolve around [[psychological]], [[social]], and [[political]] affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[feminism]], and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as [[experimental theater]] or [[symbolic theater]].

==Audience Appeal==
Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue.
Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest.
Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.”
As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas.

==Text==
The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic.
The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinary') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “[[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also imply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show.
Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas.
The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.”

==Social expression==
Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6217">'''Face-ism''' or '''facial prominence''' is the relative prominence of the face in the portrayal of men and women; media tend to focus more on men's faces and women's bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Gary N., and Laura M. Graves (3rd Edition, SAGE 2003) ''Women and Men in Management'' (page 59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and evidence==

[[File:Face-ism Mona Lisa.svg|thumb|300px|Illustration of calculation of face-ism index on two crops of the Mona Lisa.]]

The term "face-ism" or "facial prominence" was initially defined in a 1983 study in which facial prominence was measured by a "Face-ism index", which is the ratio of two linear measurements, with the distance (in millimeters or any other unit) from the top of the head to the lowest visible point of the [[chin]] being the numerator and the distance from the top of the head to the lowest visible part of the subject's body the denominator. It was found that across societies and time, facial prominence of men has been much higher than that of women.&lt;ref name=archer1983&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.725 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=45 | issue=4 | pages=725–735 | last=Archer | first=Dane |author2=Iritani, Bonita |author3=Kimes, Debra D. |author4= Barrios, Michael  | title=Face-ism: Five studies of sex differences in facial prominence | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent studies have generated consistent findings and thus helped confirm the pervasive presence of face-ism. For instance, a prevalent face-ism phenomenon was observed in [[news magazine]]s and [[women's magazine]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1988.tb00938.x | issn=0361-6843 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=225–235 | last=Nigro | first=Georgia N. |author2=Hill, Dina E. |author3=Gelbein, Martha E. |author4= Clark, Catharine L.  | title=Changes in the Facial Prominence of Women and Men Over the Last Decade | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |date=1 June 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Face-ism has been documented in [[prime-time television]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/08838158909364075 | issn=1550-6878| volume=33 | issue=2 | pages=209–214 | last=Copeland | first=Gary A. | title=Face-ism and primetime television | journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has been shown that face-ism is still present in mainstream printed media from as recently as 2004, and showed that men in intellectually focused occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than women in similar professions, while women in physical occupations tend to have higher face-to-body ratios than men in similar professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9276-3 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=57 | issue=7-8 | pages=515–525 | last=Matthews | first=Justin L. | title=Hidden Sexism: Facial Prominence and Its Connections to Gender and Occupational Status in Popular Print Media | journal=Sex Roles | date=17 August 2007 | url=https://www.academia.edu/353822/Hidden_Sexism_Facial_Prominence_and_Its_Connections_to_Gender_and_Occupational_Status_in_Popular_Print_Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-cultural study on face-ism found that face-ism in photographs of politicians is more pronounced in gender-egalitarian societies compared to gender-unequal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/0361684312455317 | issn=0361-6843 | last=Konrath | first=Sara |author2=Au, Josephine |author3=Ramsey, Laura R.  | title=Cultural Differences in Face-ism: Male Politicians Have Bigger Heads in More Gender-Equal Cultures | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | date=8 August 2012 | url=http://www.sarakonrath.com/media/publications/konrath_au_ramsey_2012_in_press_faceism.pdf | volume=36 | pages=476–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no relation between face-ism and the perception of intellect.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994 /&gt;

==Implications==

It was found that regardless of gender difference, news photographs featuring high face prominence tend to generate more positive ratings with regard to intelligence, ambition and physical appearance than those with low face prominence.&lt;ref name=archer1983 /&gt;

Similarly, another study argued that as a series of mental life dimensions including intelligence, personality, and character, are closely associated with the face and head; higher face-ism of men may convey impressions of greater intelligence, dominance, and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00987481 | issn=0191-5886 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=215–229 | last=Zuckerman | first= Miron | title=On the meaning and implications of facial prominence | journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior | date=1 December 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the greater body-ism of women (analyzed in [[Alcohol advertising|television beer commercials]]) serves to reinforce the stereotypical images of women as trophies or [[sex object]]s without personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF01544592 | issn=0360-0025 | volume=31 | issue=5-6 | pages=329–337 | last=Hall | first=Christine C. Iijima |author2=Crum, Matthew J. | title=Women and "body-isms" in television beer commercials | journal=Sex Roles | date=1 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face-ism may not be merely restricted to gender difference but can apply to racial difference as well. For instance, the study revealed that Caucasians have higher face-ism than blacks across different media types.&lt;ref name=zuckerman1994&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.86 | issn=1939-1315 | volume=66 | issue=1 | pages=86–92 | last=Zuckerman | first=Miron |author2=Kieffer, Suzanne C. | title=Race differences in face-ism: Does facial prominence imply dominance? | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | year= 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fuzzy logic''' is a form of [[many-valued logic]] in which the [[truth value]]s of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Novák, V. |last2=Perfilieva, I. |last3=Močkoř, J.  |title=Mathematical principles of fuzzy logic |date=1999 |publisher=Kluwer Academic |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-7923-8595-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in [[Boolean algebra|Boolean logic]], the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

The term ''fuzzy logic'' was introduced with the 1965 proposal of [[fuzzy set theory]] by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Lotfi Zadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-fuzzy/ |title=Fuzzy Logic |accessdate=2008-09-30 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Bryant University |date=2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zadeh | first1 = L.A. | year = 1965 | title = Fuzzy sets | url = | journal = Information and Control | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(65)90241-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuzzy logic had however  been studied since the 1920s, as [[Łukasiewicz logic|infinite-valued logic]]—notably by [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelletier | first1 = Francis Jeffry | year = 2000 | title = Review of ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logics'' | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ReviewHajek.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–346 | jstor = 421060 | doi = 10.2307/421060 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172812/http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ReviewHajek.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information, fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information, hence the term fuzzy. These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and utilising data and information that are vague and lack certainty.&lt;ref&gt;What is Fuzzy Logic? [https://mechanicalsite.com/157/what-is-fuzzy-logic "Mechanical Engineering Discussion Forum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from [[control theory]] to [[artificial intelligence]].

==Overview==
[[Classical logic]] only permits conclusions which are either true or false. However, there are also propositions with variable answers, such as one might find when asking a group of people to identify a color.  In such instances, the truth appears as the result of reasoning from inexact or partial knowledge in which the sampled answers are mapped on a spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Both degrees of truth and [[probability|probabilities]] range between 0 and 1 and hence may seem similar at first, but fuzzy logic uses degrees of truth as a [[mathematical model]] of ''vagueness'', while [[probability]] is a mathematical model of ''ignorance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QBBADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA4-PA13&amp;lpg=SA4-PA13&amp;dq=Both+degrees+of+truth+and+probabilities+range+between+0+and+1+and+hence+may+seem+similar+at+first,+but+fuzzy+logic+uses+degrees+of+truth+as+a+mathematical+model+of+vagueness,+while+probability+is+a+mathematical+model+of+ignorance#v=onepage&amp;q=Both%20degrees%20of%20truth%20and%20probabilities%20range%20between%200%20and%201%20and%20hence%20may%20seem%20similar%20at%20first,%20but%20fuzzy%20logic%20uses%20degrees%20of%20truth%20as%20a%20mathematical%20model%20of%20vagueness,%20while%20probability%20is%20a%20mathematical%20model%20of%20ignorance&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Research for Fluid and Solid Mechanics: Theory, Simulation, and Experiment|last=Asli|first=Kaveh Hariri|last2=Aliyev|first2=Soltan Ali Ogli|last3=Thomas|first3=Sabu|last4=Gopakumar|first4=Deepu A.|date=2017-11-23|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781315341507|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applying truth values===
A basic application might characterize various sub-ranges of a [[Variable (mathematics)|continuous variable]].  For instance, a temperature measurement for [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] might have several separate membership functions defining particular temperature ranges needed to control the brakes properly. Each function maps the same temperature value to a truth value in the 0 to 1 range. These truth values can then be used to determine how the brakes should be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-ZXJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=For+instance,+a+temperature+measurement+for+anti-lock+brakes+might+have+several+separate+membership+functions+defining+particular+temperature+ranges+needed+to+control+the+brakes+properly.+Each+function+maps+the+same+temperature+value+to+a+truth+value+in+the+0+to+1+range.+These+truth+values+can+then+be+used+to+determine+how+the+brakes+should+be+controlled#v=onepage&amp;q=For%20instance%2C%20a%20temperature%20measurement%20for%20anti-lock%20brakes%20might%20have%20several%20separate%20membership%20functions%20defining%20particular%20temperature%20ranges%20needed%20to%20control%20the%20brakes%20properly.%20Each%20function%20maps%20the%20same%20temperature%20value%20to%20a%20truth%20value%20in%20the%200%20to%201%20range.%20These%20truth%20values%20can%20then%20be%20used%20to%20determine%20how%20the%20brakes%20should%20be%20controlled&amp;f=false|title=Optical Character Recognition Systems for Different Languages with Soft Computing|last=Chaudhuri|first=Arindam|last2=Mandaviya|first2=Krupa|last3=Badelia|first3=Pratixa|last4=Ghosh|first4=Soumya K.|date=2016-12-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319502526|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic variables===
While variables in mathematics usually take numerical values, in fuzzy logic applications, non-numeric values are often used to facilitate the expression of rules and facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zadeh |first1=L. A. |last2=et al. |title=Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Systems |date=1996 |publisher=World Scientific Press |isbn=978-981-02-2421-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A linguistic variable such as ''age'' may accept values such as ''young'' and its antonym ''old''.  Because natural languages do not always contain enough value terms to express a fuzzy value scale, it is common practice to modify linguistic values with [[adjectives]] or [[adverbs]].  For example, we can use the [[hedge (linguistics)|hedges]] ''rather'' and ''somewhat'' to construct the additional values ''rather old'' or ''somewhat young''.

Fuzzification operations can map mathematical input values into fuzzy membership functions. And the opposite de-fuzzifying operations can be used to map a fuzzy output membership functions into a "crisp" output value that can be then used for decision or control purposes.

==Process==

# Fuzzify all input values into fuzzy membership functions.
# Execute all applicable rules in the rulebase to compute the fuzzy output functions.
# De-fuzzify the fuzzy output functions to get "crisp" output values.

===Fuzzification===

{{Confusing|section|reason=this section does not give an explicit definition of what Fuzzification is or why it might need to be done|date=May 2018}}

[[Image:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|center|300px|Fuzzy logic temperature]]

In this image, the meanings of the expressions ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' are represented by functions mapping a temperature scale. A point on that scale has three "truth values"—one for each of the three functions. The vertical line in the image represents a particular temperature that the three arrows (truth values) gauge. Since the red arrow points to zero, this temperature may be interpreted as "not hot". The orange arrow (pointing at 0.2) may describe it as "slightly warm" and the blue arrow (pointing at 0.8) "fairly cold".

[[Fuzzy set]]s are often defined as triangle or trapezoid-shaped curves, as each value will have a slope where the value is increasing, a peak where the value is equal to 1 (which can have a length of 0 or greater) and a slope where the value is decreasing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} They can also be defined using a [[sigmoid function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wierman|first1=Mark J.|title=An Introduction to the Mathematics of Uncertainty: including Set Theory, Logic, Probability, Fuzzy Sets, Rough Sets, and Evidence Theory|url=https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|publisher=Creighton University|accessdate=16 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730155249/https://www.creighton.edu/fileadmin/user/CCAS/programs/fuzzy_math/docs/MOU.pdf|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common case is the [[Logistic function|standard logistic function]] defined as

: &lt;math&gt; S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} &lt;/math&gt;

which has the following symmetry property

: &lt;math display="block"&gt; S(x) + S(-x) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

From this it follows that

&lt;math display="block"&gt; (S(x) + S(-x)) \cdot (S(y) + S(-y)) \cdot (S(z) + S(-z)) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Fuzzy logic operators===

Fuzzy logic works with membership values in a way that mimics [[Boolean logic]]. To this end, replacements for basic [[operator (computer programming)|operator]]s AND, OR, NOT must be available. There are several ways to this. A common replacement is called the ''Zadeh operators'':

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Boolean
! Fuzzy
|-
| AND(x,y)
| MIN(x,y)
|-
| OR(x,y)
| MAX(x,y)
|-
| NOT(x)
| 1 – x
|-
|}

For TRUE/1 and FALSE/0, the fuzzy expressions produce the same result as the Boolean expressions.

There are also other operators, more linguistic in nature, called ''hedges'' that can be applied. These are generally adverbs such as ''very'', or ''somewhat'', which modify the meaning of a set using a [[mathematical formula]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

However, an arbitrary choice table does not always define a fuzzy logic function. In the paper,&lt;ref &gt; {{ Cite journal | last1 = Zaitsev | first1 = D.A. | author2 = Sarbei, V.G. | author3 = Sleptsov, A.I. | year = 1998 | title = Synthesis of continuous-valued logic functions defined in tabular form | journal = [[Cybernetics and Systems Analysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 190– 195 | doi = 10.1007/BF02742068 }} &lt;/ref&gt; a criterion has been formulated to recognize whether a given choice table defines a fuzzy logic function and a simple algorithm of fuzzy logic function synthesis has been proposed based on introduced concepts of constituents of minimum and maximum. A fuzzy logic function represents a disjunction of constituents of minimum, where a constituent of minimum is a conjunction of variables of the current area greater than or equal to the function value in this area (to the right of the function value in the inequality, including the function value).

Another set of AND/OR operators is based on multiplication

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
x AND y = x*y
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y) = x+y-x*y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

1-(1-x)*(1-y) comes from this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
x OR y = NOT( AND( NOT(x), NOT(y) ) )
x OR y = NOT( AND(1-x, 1-y) )
x OR y = NOT( (1-x)*(1-y) )
x OR y = 1-(1-x)*(1-y)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== IF-THEN rules ===
{{Main|Fuzzy rule}}
IF-THEN rules  map input or computed truth values to desired output truth values. Example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
IF temperature IS very cold THEN fan_speed is stopped
IF temperature IS cold THEN fan_speed is slow
IF temperature IS warm THEN fan_speed is moderate
IF temperature IS hot THEN fan_speed is high
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Given a certain temperature, the fuzzy variable ''hot'' has a certain truth value, which is copied to the ''high'' variable.

Should an output variable occur in several THEN parts, then the values from the respective IF parts are combined using the OR operator.

===Defuzzification===
{{Main|Defuzzification}}
The goal is to get a continuous variable from fuzzy truth values.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

This would be easy if the output truth values were exactly those obtained from fuzzification of a given number.
Since, however, all output truth values are computed independently, in most cases they do not represent such a set of numbers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
One has then to decide for a number that matches best the "intention" encoded in the truth value.
For example, for several truth values of fan_speed, an actual speed must be found that best fits the computed truth values of the variables 'slow', 'medium' and so on. {{Citation needed | date = September 2017 }}

There is no single algorithm for this purpose.

A common algorithm is
# For each truth value, cut the membership function at this value
# Combine the resulting curves using the OR operator
# Find the center-of-weight of the area under the curve
# The x position of this center is then the final output.

==Forming a consensus of inputs and fuzzy rules==

Since the fuzzy system output is a consensus of all of the inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate the degree to which a rule affects the output values. These rule weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each rule. These rule weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.

==Early applications==

Many of the early successful applications of fuzzy logic were implemented in Japan. The first notable application was on the subway train in [[Sendai]], in which fuzzy logic was able to improve the economy, comfort, and precision of the ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosko|first=B|date=June 1, 1994|title=Fuzzy Thinking:  The New Science of Fuzzy Logic|journal=Hyperion}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in recognition of hand written symbols in Sony pocket computers, flight aid for helicopters, controlling of subway systems in order to improve driving comfort, precision of halting, and power economy, improved fuel consumption for automobiles, single-button control for washing machines, automatic motor control for vacuum cleaners with recognition of surface condition and degree of soiling, and prediction systems for early recognition of earthquakes through the Institute of Seismology Bureau of Meteorology, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bansod |first1=Nitin A |last2=Kulkarni |first2=Marshall |last3=Patil |first3=S.H. |editor1-last=Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering |title=Soft Computing |date=2005 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-7764-632-0 |pages=73 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&amp;lr=&amp;id=IkajJC9iGxMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA73&amp;ots=wCguK3mg5U&amp;sig=s0AeSESut1p9dXQriXJG01oJ3ac |accessdate=9 November 2018 |ref=harv |chapter=Soft Computing- A Fuzzy Logic Approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical analysis ==
In [[mathematical logic]], there are several [[formal system]]s of "fuzzy logic", most of which are in the family of [[t-norm fuzzy logics]].

=== Propositional fuzzy logics ===
The most important propositional fuzzy logics are:
* [[MTL (logic)|Monoidal t-norm-based propositional fuzzy logic]] MTL is an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of logic where [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] is defined by a left continuous [[t-norm]] and implication is defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]s correspond to MTL-algebras that are pre-linear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.
* [[BL (logic)|Basic propositional fuzzy logic]] BL is an extension of MTL logic where conjunction is defined by a continuous t-norm, and implication is also defined as the residuum of the t-norm. Its models correspond to BL-algebras.
* [[Lukasiewicz fuzzy logic|Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]] is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where standard conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It has the axioms of basic fuzzy logic plus an axiom of double negation, and its models correspond to MV-algebras.
* Gödel fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is [[Gödel]] t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus an axiom of idempotence of conjunction, and its models are called G-algebras.
* Product fuzzy logic is the extension of basic fuzzy logic BL where conjunction is product t-norm. It has the axioms of BL plus another axiom for cancellativity of conjunction, and its models are called product algebras.
* Fuzzy logic with evaluated syntax (sometimes also called Pavelka's logic), denoted by EVŁ, is a further generalization of mathematical fuzzy logic. While the above kinds of fuzzy logic have traditional syntax and many-valued semantics, in EVŁ is evaluated also syntax. This means that each formula has an evaluation. Axiomatization of EVŁ stems from Łukasziewicz fuzzy logic. A generalization of classical Gödel completeness theorem is provable in EVŁ.

=== Predicate fuzzy logics ===
These extend the above-mentioned fuzzy logics by adding [[universal quantifier|universal]] and [[existential quantifier]]s in a manner similar to the way that [[predicate logic]] is created from [[propositional logic]]. The semantics of the universal (resp. existential) quantifier in [[t-norm fuzzy logics]] is the [[infimum]] (resp. [[supremum]]) of the truth degrees of the instances of the quantified subformula.

===Decidability issues for fuzzy logic===
The notions of a "decidable subset" and "[[recursively enumerable]] subset" are basic ones for [[classical mathematics]] and [[classical logic]]. Thus the question of a suitable extension of them to [[fuzzy set theory]] is a crucial one. A first proposal in such a direction was made by E.S. Santos by the notions of ''fuzzy [[Turing machine]]'', ''Markov normal fuzzy algorithm'' and ''fuzzy program'' (see Santos 1970). Successively, L. Biacino and G. Gerla argued that the proposed definitions are rather questionable. For example, in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerla|first=G.|year=2016|title=Comments on some theories of fuzzy computation|url=|journal= International Journal of General Systems|volume=45|issue=4|pages=372–392|doi=10.1080/03081079.2015.1076403}}&lt;/ref&gt; one shows that the fuzzy Turing machines are not  adequate for fuzzy language theory since there are natural fuzzy languages intuitively computable that cannot be recognized by a fuzzy Turing Machine.  Then, they proposed the following definitions. Denote by ''Ü''  the set of rational numbers in [0,1]. Then a fuzzy subset ''s'' : ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[0,1] of a set ''S'' is recursively enumerable if a recursive map ''h'' : ''S''×''N'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;''Ü'' exists such that, for every ''x'' in ''S'', the function ''h''(''x'',''n'') is increasing with respect to ''n'' and ''s''(''x'') = lim ''h''(''x'',''n'').
We say that ''s'' is ''decidable'' if both ''s'' and its complement –''s'' are recursively enumerable. An extension of such a theory to the general case of the L-subsets is possible (see Gerla 2006).
The proposed definitions are well related with fuzzy logic. Indeed, the following theorem holds true (provided that the deduction apparatus of the considered fuzzy logic satisfies some obvious effectiveness property).

Any "axiomatizable" fuzzy theory is recursively enumerable. In particular, the [[fuzzy set]] of logically true formulas is recursively enumerable in spite of the fact that the crisp set of valid formulas is not recursively enumerable, in general. Moreover, any axiomatizable and complete theory is decidable.

It is an open question to give supports for a "Church thesis" for [[fuzzy mathematics]], the proposed notion of recursive enumerability for fuzzy subsets is the adequate one. In order to solve this, an extension of the notions of fuzzy grammar and fuzzy [[Turing machine]] are necessary. Another open question is to start from this notion to find an extension of [[Gödel]]'s theorems to fuzzy logic.

==Fuzzy databases==
Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy [[relational database]]s. The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in [[Maria Zemankova]]'s dissertation (1983). Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al.

Fuzzy querying languages have been defined, such as the [[SQLf]] by P. Bosc et al. and the [[FSQL]] by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels etc.

==Comparison to probability==
Fuzzy logic and probability address different forms of uncertainty. While both fuzzy logic and probability theory can represent degrees of certain kinds of subjective belief, [[fuzzy set theory]] uses the concept of fuzzy set membership, i.e., how much an observation is within a vaguely defined set, and probability theory uses the concept of [[subjective probability]], i.e., likelihood of some event or condition. The concept of fuzzy sets was developed in the mid-twentieth century at Berkeley &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |title=Lofti Zadeh Berkeley |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080227/https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/zadeh.html |archivedate=2017-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a response to the lacking of probability theory for jointly modelling uncertainty and [[vagueness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Fuzzy_sets |title=Fuzzy Sets |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=2031 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413125658/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Fuzzy_sets |archivedate=2009-04-13 |df= |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2031 |year=2006 |last1=Mares |first1=Milan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bart Kosko]] claims in Fuzziness vs. Probability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kosko |first1=Bart |authorlink1=Bart Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |url=http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Fuzziness_Vs_Probability.pdf |publisher=University of South California |accessdate=9 November 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; that probability theory is a subtheory of fuzzy logic, as questions of degrees of belief in mutually-exclusive set membership in probability theory can be represented as certain cases of non-mutually-exclusive graded membership in fuzzy theory. In that context, he also derives [[Bayes' theorem]] from the concept of fuzzy subsethood. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] argues that fuzzy logic is different in character from probability, and is not a replacement for it. He fuzzified probability to fuzzy probability and also generalized it to [[possibility theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novák | first1 = V | year = 2005 | title = Are fuzzy sets a reasonable tool for modeling vague phenomena? | url = | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 156 | issue = 3| pages = 341–348 | doi=10.1016/j.fss.2005.05.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, fuzzy logic is one of many different extensions to classical logic intended to deal with issues of uncertainty outside of the scope of classical logic, the inapplicability of probability theory in many domains, and the paradoxes of [[Dempster-Shafer theory]].

==Relation to ecorithms==
Computational theorist [[Leslie Valiant]] uses the term ''ecorithms'' to describe how many less exact systems and techniques like fuzzy logic (and "less robust" logic) can be applied to [[learning algorithms]]. Valiant essentially redefines machine learning as evolutionary. In general use, ecorithms are algorithms that learn from their more complex environments (hence ''eco-'') to generalize, approximate and simplify solution logic. Like fuzzy logic, they are methods used to overcome continuous variables or systems too complex to completely enumerate or understand discretely or exactly. &lt;!-- See in particular p.&amp;nbsp;58 of the reference comparing induction/invariance, robust, mathematical and other logical limits in computing, where techniques including fuzzy logic and natural data selection (à la "computational Darwinism") can be used to short-cut computational complexity and limits in a "practical" way (such as the brake temperature example in this article). --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valiant, Leslie |title=Probably Approximately Correct: Nature's Algorithms for Learning and Prospering in a Complex World |date=2013 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0465032716 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecorithms and fuzzy logic also have the common property of dealing with possibilities more than probabilities, although feedback and [[feed forward (control)|feed forward]], basically stochastic weights, are a feature of both when dealing with, for example, dynamical systems.

== Compensatory fuzzy logic ==

Compensatory fuzzy logic (CFL) is a branch of fuzzy logic with modified rules for conjunction and disjunction. When the truth value of one component of a conjunction or disjunction is increased or decreased, the other component is decreased or increased to compensate. This increase or decrease in truth value may be offset by the increase or decrease in another component. An offset may be blocked when certain thresholds are met. Proponents{{who|date=July 2015}} claim that CFL allows for better computational semantic behaviors and mimic natural language.{{vague|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004060002/http://web.mit.edu/6.863/www/fall2012/projects/writeups/semantic-similarity-betweenverbs.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veri|first=Francesco|year=2017|title=Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Conditions in fsQCA: Problems and Solutions|url=|journal= Sociological Methods &amp; Research|pages=004912411772969|doi=10.1177/0049124117729693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensatory Fuzzy Logic consists of four continuous operators: conjunction (c); disjunction (d); fuzzy strict order (or); and negation (n). The conjunction is the geometric mean and its dual as conjunctive and disjunctive operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cejas |first1=Jesús |title=Compensatory Fuzzy Logic |journal=Revista de Ingeniería Industrial |date=2011 |issn=1815-5936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of FML, fuzzy logic practitioners could exchange information about their fuzzy algorithms by &amp;nbsp;adding to their software functions the ability to read, correctly parse, and store the results of their work in a &amp;nbsp;form compatible with the [[Fuzzy Control Language]] (FCL) described and specified by Part 7 of [[IEC 61131]].&lt;ref name="Di Stefano2013"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Di Stefano|first1=Bruno N.|title=On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|year=2013|pages=3–15|issn=1434-9922|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5_1|series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing|isbn=978-3-642-35487-8|chapter=On the Need of a Standard Language for Designing Fuzzy Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcamporaLoia2013"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Acampora|first1=Giovanni|last2=Loia|first2=Vincenzo|last3=Lee|first3=Chang-Shing|last4=Wang|first4=Mei-Hui| title= On the Power of Fuzzy Markup Language|volume=296|year=2013|issn=1434-9922|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35488-5|series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing|isbn=978-3-642-35487-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender sensitization''' precides over [[Gender Sensitivity|gender sensitivity]] which refers to the [[Behavior modification|modification of behavior]] by [[Consciousness raising|raising awareness]] of [[gender equality]] concerns.&lt;ref name="IJSR"/&gt; This can be achieved by conducting various [[sensitization]] campaigns, training centres, workshop, programs etc. Sensitization in the domain of [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]], is seen as an awareness informed propensity or disposition which aims at changing behavior so that it is sensitive to certain issues. Gender sensitization may be seen as "the awareness informed disposition or propensity to behave in a manner which is sensitive to gender justice and gender equality issues."&lt;ref name="IJSR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding the Concept of Sensitisation in Humanities and Social Sciences : An Exploration in Philosophy of Mind | author=Dr. Jatinder Kumar Sharma | journal=International Journal of Scientific Research | date=March 2016 | volume= 24| issue=90 | pages=380–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interlinked with [[gender empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/1931007/Gender_Sensitization_and_Police | title=Gender Sensitization and Police | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Bhowmick Soma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender sensitization theories claim that modification of the behavior of [[teaching|teachers]] and parents (etc.) towards children which can have a causal effect on gender equality.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Gender sensitizing "is about changing behavior and instilling [[empathy]] into the views that we hold about our own and the other genders."&lt;ref name=Aksornkool&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender sensitivity: a training manual for sensitizing education managers, curriculum and material developers and media professionals to gender concerns|first=Namtip|last=Aksornkool|editor1-first=Cindy|editor1-last=Joerger|editor2-first=Elaine|editor2-last=Taylor|page=VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps people in "examining their personal attitudes and beliefs and questioning the 'realities' they thought they know.

Gender Sensitization is one basic requirement for the normal development of an individual. Without being sensitive to the needs of a particular gender, an individual may refrain from understanding the opposite gender and in some acute cases even him or herself. The need for this sensitivity has been felt and realised through times immemorial and in almost all kinds of human existence, across the globe.

The '''Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation''' is a [[Gilding|gilt]]-[[bronze]] statue of [[Maitreya]] seated in meditation and is one of the best known and most highly regarded [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Judith Smith, ''Arts of Korea''. (1998) p. 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Korea]], it was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cha.go.kr/chaen/search/selectGeneralSearchDetail.do?sCcebKdcd=11&amp;ccebAsno=00780000&amp;sCcebCtcd=11 |title=Heritage Search - National Treasure 78 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is 83.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.  It was cast from bronze and gilded, probably in the middle or late 6th century.  The bronze is less than one centimeter in thickness (and as thin as 2 mm&lt;ref name="NMK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.go.kr/site/eng/relic/search/view?relicId=4358 |title=Collection Database - Pensive Bodhisattva |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2018-01-22 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which attests to the skills of bronze-workers during this time period.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

In 1912 a Japanese person acquired it, and donated it to the General Governing Department of Japan over [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]. Since 1916 it has been housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The maitreya is semi-seated on a stool with its right leg crossed over the left in deep meditation.  The face of the statue, has a hint of a smile, and exhibits a sense of serene concentration.  The right arm of the statue, at the elbow, rests on its lap while its delicate hand reaches towards its cheek giving the impression of deep thought.  One shoulder of the maitreya is slightly higher than the other and the upper body is slightly bent forward which also creates the impresses on the viewer an aura of deep thought.  The statue wears a crown which is rather elaborate with many prongs and parts of the crown rest on the shoulders of the maitreya.  The statue is also dressed in a complicated scarf-like vestment that curves around the body with wing-like projections.  The left foot rests on a base which is shaped like a lotus flower.  The statue is probably of [[Silla]] provenance because of the style is more formalized than realistic.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

At one point, the statue had a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], but only traces of it remain. It was designated as the 78th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. An X-ray analysis in 1963 showed that "it has no trace of defect or repair either inside or out, and that it was made of a rare material using unique techniques.".&lt;ref name="CHA"/&gt;

The '''glass sea creatures''' (alternately called the ''Blaschka sea creatures'', ''glass marine invertebrates'', and ''Blaschka invertebrate models'') are works of [[glass art]]ists [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]]. The spiritual predecessors of the [[Glass Flowers]], the sea creatures were the output of the Blaschkas' successful mail-order business of supplying museums and private collectors around the world with sets of [[glass]] models of [[marine invertebrates]].

Between 1863 and 1880, the Blaschkas – working in [[Dresden]] – executed at least 10,000 of these highly detailed glass models, representing some 700 different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Sarakas, [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/art/2016/08/06/corning-exhibit-peeks-undersea-world-glass/87749928/ Corning exhibit shows sea creatures in glass], ''[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]]'' (August 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of large collections of the models are held by museums and other academic institutions. [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] holds 430 items in its Blaschka Glass Invertebrate Collection and displays about 60 at any given time).&lt;ref name="dm.cmog.org"&gt;[http://mcz.harvard.edu/collections/blaschka_coll.html Blaschka Glass Invertebrate Collection], [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], [[Harvard University]] (2016),&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cornell University]] has about 570 items in its collection and has restored some 170 of these,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/ Out of the Teeming Sea: The Cornell Collection of Blaschka Invertebrate Models], [[Albert R.

==Inspiration==
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden.tif|thumb|Rudolf (standing), Caroline, and Leopold Blaschka in the garden of their Dresden home]]

In 1853, shortly after the death of his father and wife Caroline, the latter to a cholera epidemic, Leopold Blaschka – grief stricken and in need of a vacation – traveled to the United States. En route, however, and the ship was becalmed and lay still upon the sea for two weeks.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/article/blaschkas-glass-models-invertebrate-animals-1863-1890 Corning Museum of Glass: Blaschkas' Glass Models of Invertebrate Animals (1863–1890)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of forced idleness, Leopold studied and sketched the local marine [[invertebrate]] population, intrigued by the transparency of their bodies which was next of kin to the glass his family had long worked.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urania-dresden.de/Blaschka_engl.html |title=Förderverein "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst Blaschka-Haus e. V". (The Promotional Association "Scientific Glass Art – Blaschka-Haus e. V.") |publisher=Urania-dresden.de |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011548/http://www.urania-dresden.de/Blaschka_engl.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }} &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Short title: "Blaschka – English version". Translation by Peter Silbernagl. Lead sentence: "In September 2000, an association was founded in Dresden-Hosterwitz with the aim to establish a museum-type memorial for the work of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka and to treasure the memory of those two glass-artists." &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; Earliest English-language title: The Association "Naturwissenschaftliche Glaskunst – Blaschka-Haus e.V.". Johanna Dühning, Chairman of the Association; translation by Benjamin Pentzold ().&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Leopold felt a sense of quiet, inspirational, wonder at these luminescent ocean dwellers, a sense which he recorded and has been since translated by a Henri Reiling: ''"It is a beautiful night in May. Hopeful, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt;

This sense of wonder would fuel his later work but, in the meantime and upon his return to [[Dresden]], Leopold focused on his family business which was the production the glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master [[Lampworking|Lampworker]] could accomplish;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; plus the task of furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka. However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled ''Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants'' (otherwise known as the Glass Flowers), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Yet, unsurprisingly given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de [[House of Rohan|Rohan]] who, being something of a naturalist himself, commissioned the Blaschkas to craft 100 glass [[orchid]]s for his private collection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;"Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...}". Design Museum (designmuseum.org). Retrieved 2015-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally the Prince was more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, and "between 1860 and 1862, the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,"&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another – man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Professor [[Ludwig Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"&gt;[http://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/a-tale-of-two-glassworkers-and-their-marine-marvels/ A Tale of Two Glassworkers and Their Marine Marvels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reichenbach's request==
[[File:Reichenbach Ludwig 1793-1879.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Professor Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach]]
Director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach was faced with an annoying yet seemingly unsolvable problem in regards to showing marine life. Land-based flora and fauna was not an issue, for it was a relatively simple matter to exhibit mounted and stuffed creatures such as gorillas and elephants, there lifelike poses attracting and exciting the museums visitors. Invertebrates, however, and by their very nature, posed a problem.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/intro.php Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/research/library/collections/digital/blaschka The Blaschka Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, Prof. Reichenbach wanted something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; And, per remarkably coincidence, in 1863 "saw an exhibition of highly detailed, realistic glass flowers created by a Bohemian lampworker named Leopold Blaschka."&lt;ref name=blaschka_archive/&gt;

[[File:Blaschka 1.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of sea anemones]]

Enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own showcasing issue, in 1863&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencefriday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L. Blaschka, Dresden, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; These marine models, hailed as "an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,"&lt;ref&gt;https://museum.wales/articles/2007-05-15/Sea-creatures-of-the-deep---the-Blaschka-Glass-models/&lt;/ref&gt; were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and [[papier-mâché]] or wax models.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, Anne Collins, and Weitekamp, Margaret A. Analyzing Art and Aesthetics. Artefacts: Studies in the History of Science and Technology ; v. 9. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and exactly what Prof. Reichenbach needed. Moreover they, at last, provided an outlet for the wonder Leopold had felt all those years ago when observing the phosphorescent ocean life. The key fact, though, was that these glass marine models were, as would soon be acknowledged, "perfectly true to nature,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; and as such represented an extraordinary opportunity boh for the scientific community and the Blaschkas themselves. Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors.&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designmuseum.org/design/leopold-rudolf-blaschka |title=Leopold + Rudolf Blaschka {...} The Glass Aquarium {...} |publisher=[[Design Museum]] (designmuseum.org) |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advice which would prove wise and fateful both economically and scientifically, for Leopold did as the Dresden natural history museum director suggested.

==A successful business==
[[File:Blaschka 4.jpg|thumb|left|Blaschka model of jellyfish]]
Unlike the eventual Glass Flower, a private commission to a single University's museum, the Blaschka glass sea creatures were a global enterprise; and not just for museums and other such educational institutes, for "as popular interest in the history and sciences of the natural world burgeoned during the latter half of the 19th century, the sea became particularly alluring. The spread of home aquariums and the advent of deep-sea diving revealed a new frontier, filled with wondrous and unusual creatures."&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"&gt;[http://news.wisc.edu/glass-menagerie-museum-unearths-exotic-stash-of-glass-sea-creatures/ University of Wisconsin–Madison: ‘Glass menagerie:’ Museum unearths exotic stash of glass sea creatures]&lt;/ref&gt; In short, for the first time since [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], there was great universal interest in the natural world, and it became a sign of culture, of worldliness and sophistication, to exhibit examples of life in one's drawing rooms and parlors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence private individuals were after these extraordinary models as well, and the Blaschkas, knowing this and knowing that Reichenbach was correct in that many museums would want them, made a mail-order business out of it. This business was hugely successful and they ended up making and selling a believed 10,000 of glass invertebrates dispersed in a diaspora of shipments all across the globe.&lt;ref name="dm.cmog.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models"&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"&gt;http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-delicate-glass-sea-creatures-of-leopold-and-rudolf-blaschka&lt;/ref&gt; and yet they were available via so common a means as mail-order per one's local card catalog; for example, [[Ward's Natural Science]] would sell a small glass octopus for approximately $2.50.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had – for natural history museums directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem.&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; In short, Blaschka invertebrate models mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reason: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species,&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt; and his reputation quickly spread.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

As Leopold truthfully wrote in an English-language trade catalog (which the Rakow Research Library at The Corning Museum of Glass has thankfully preserved):''"[Models of invertebrate animals] have been purchased by... museums and scholastic establishments in all the quarters of the globe... in New Zealand... in Tokio [sic], Japan... for the Indian Museum in Calcutta... in the United States of America by Professor Ward's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York; for the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts; for the Boston Society of Natural History; the University of Cornell; the Wellesley Female College... In Great Britain, Scotland and Ireland, copies have been conveyed to London, Edinburgh and Dublin... In Austria, orders have not only been made for the Imperial Royal Court collection, but also for the universities in Innsbruck, Graz, Czernovitz, and so forth. In Germany, purchases have been made for the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Koenigsberg, Jena, Leipzig, Rostock and many other museums."''&lt;ref name="cmog.org"/&gt; Furthermore, Leopold gradually extended his range of work by studying marine animals from the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Mediterranean]],&lt;ref name="archived 2002-09-10"/&gt;  and later constructed an aquarium at his house, in order to keep live specimens from which to model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Yet the fate of the marine invertebrate mail-order business was ultimately to be tied to those bought by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. At some time after the museum's founding in 1859, a collection of 430 glass sea creatures were purchased by either Professor [[Louis Agassiz]], the first director, or his son and successor [[Alexander Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; This set was not the largest ever sold and the models were no different from any of the others made by the Blaschkas, but, again, their affect was to be greater than all the rest combined.

==From invertebrates to flowers==
{{main article|Glass Flowers}}
[[File:PSM V39 D594 George Lincoln Goodale.jpg|thumb|Professor George Lincoln Goodale|left|150px]]
Paradoxically and in historically circular twist, the reason that the glass sea creatures sold to Harvard were to prove so crucial was because the University would soon, and did, open its new [[Harvard University Herbaria|Botanical Museum]] in 1888. Given in effect a series of empty rooms and invited to make a museum for teaching botany, the first director, Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]], faced a familiar problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study and, as such, Prof. Goodale wanted the best for his students, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled botanical specimens – a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In fact, Goodale's problem was essentially the same as Reichenbach's had been, but applied to botany rather than marine biology for, in both cases, the practiced method of exhibition robbed the specimens of color and three-dimensional form.

[[File:GlassFlowers2HMNH.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A glass model of a cactus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History]]

Moreover and also like Prof. Reichenbach, Prof. Goodale first learned of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschkas' skill per an exhibition – that being the glass marine invertebrates belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. And, like Reichenbach, upon seeing the Blaschkas' work Goodale was instantly sure that they held the answer to his showcasing problem. Thus, in yet another direct historical parallel, in 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard. Naturally Leopold was initially unwilling as, again, his current business of selling glass marine invertebrates was booming; but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; the fragments convinced Goodale that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. Thus, with the generous sponsorship of Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter [[Mary Lee Ware|Mary]], the initial contract was signed and dictated that the Blaschkas need only work half-time on the models, thus allowing them to continue their production of the Glass sea creatures. However, in 1890, they and Goodale – acting on behalf of the Wares – signed an updated version that allowed Leopold and Rudolf to work on them (the Glass Flowers) full-time;&lt;ref name=schultes&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A.

Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas' Glass Models. Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the production and time of the Glass sea creatures was over, their fame as well as the attention of their makers shifting to the Glass Flowers – a project that, fifty years later, ended with the death of Rudolf Blaschka (Leopold having died thirty-nine years earlier).

==The models today==
Today, over a century after their making, the Glass sea creatures live in the shadow of their younger botanical cousins, so much so that many of those well aware of the Glass Flowers have never even heard of them. The fact is that, "gradually, these glass animals began to disappear, their habitats shifting into dusty closets and museum storage. People began to forget that these incredible glass creations had existed in the first place."&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"/&gt;

===Corning===
With a collection 700 models bought in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/blaschka Fragile Legacy: The Marine Invertebrate Glass Models of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; the Corning Museum of Glass boasts the largest known stash of Blaschka sea creatures. Displayed (at least in part) in an exhibition named ''Fragile Legacy'', "researchers at Cornell are using the collection as a time capsule for seeking out and documenting the creatures still living in our oceans today." In addition, Corning's exhibit allows visitors to try their own hands at crafting glass sea slugs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/fragile-legacy Fragile Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as view subsequent works inspired by the Blaschkas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/set/inspired-blaschka Inspired by Blaschka]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit is open through January 8, 2017. Finally, Corning Museum of Glass has produced a movie entitled [http://fragilelegacy.info/ Fragile Legacy] exploring the related topics of the Glass sea creatures and the living ones they represent.

Even those specimens purchased by Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) suffered a degree of neglect; they were not forgotten, but they were scattered much as the quote above describes, across several departments, and it was believed that the University only possessed 60-70 models (rather than the actual 430).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hmnh.harvard.edu/file/429666 Restoring Blaschka Sea Creatures in Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Harvard has restored and, to best of their abilities, repaired the Glass sea creatures with the hired and instrumental help of Preservation Specialist and Glass Worker Elizabeth R.

For a several month period beginning in 2015 and set to end in the early summer of 2016, the HMNH set up a "temporary display highlighting twenty-seven of the most popular plant models as well as some items from the Blaschka archives"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Glass Flowers Renovation Project Frequently Asked Questions (Harvard University Herbaria and Botany Libraries)&lt;/ref&gt; while the main Glass Flowers exhibit was under renovation. This exhibit was unique because it was the first recorded time that the Glass Flowers have been jointly exhibited with the Glass sea creatures in a major and equal display.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The renovation exhibit was dismantled when, on May 21, 2016, the main Glass Flowers exhibit reopened. The Glass sea creatures remained as a permanent exhibit.

===Cornell===
In 1885 Andrew Dixon White, first president of [[Cornell University]], authorized purchase of 570 glass marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"&gt;http://fragilelegacy.info/&lt;/ref&gt; "some of which are on exhibit at Corson Mudd Hall and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, making Cornell one of the few universities in the world where students and the public can view these wondrous creations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/history.php Cornell University: History of the Blaschka Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; However and like so many of their counterpart collections, they were neglected after a time and, in this case, remained forgotten under dust and grit until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="fragilelegacy.info"/&gt; Currently Cornell has restored approximately 170 of the models thus far and "restoration work will continue as funding allows."&lt;ref&gt;http://blaschkagallery.mannlib.cornell.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Museum of Ireland===
The [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural History Museum]] branch of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] was among the Blaschkas' "earliest customers and initially commissioned 85 glass models, paying the then significant sum of £15. It went on to purchase 530 models from the Blaschkas" – making it the largest collection of Blaschka Invertebrate Models in Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-glass-menagerie-1.1005588 The glass menagerie (The Irish Times)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Dead Zoo, as Ireland's Natural History Museum is sometimes called,&lt;ref name="archiseek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |title=Natural History Museum, Merrion Square, Dublin |last=Clerkin |first=Paul |work=Architecture of Ireland |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=2009-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035015/http://ireland.archiseek.com/buildings_ireland/dublin/southcity/merrion_square/naturalhistorymuseum.html |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/27/d605272103134.htm|title=Notes on Dublin|last=Hoque|first=Abeer|date=2006-05-27|work=The Daily Star|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; "has undertaken research on the conservation of these delicate objects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/The-Collections/Natural-History/The-Collections/Blaschka-Glass-Models Blaschka Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Noteworthy in that, like Corning, they have forever taken excellent care of the Sea Creatures, the National Museum of Ireland is another center of learning regarding the Blaschkas; a fact proven in that, in 2006, they hosted (alongside [[University College Dublin]]) the [[Dublin Blaschka Congress]], "conceived as a gathering to bring together the diverse scholarly disciplines that are uniquely, if eccentrically, joined in the study of scientific glass models."&lt;ref&gt;Sigwart, Julia D. "Crystal creatures: context for the Dublin Blaschka Congress." Historical Biology 20.1 (2008): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially and naturally, the Congress dealt with the Glass Flowers no less than their older maritime cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Dublin Blaschka Congress, special issue, Historical Biology 20 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Wisconsin–Madison===
In 2007 the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] Zoological Museum accidentally uncovered their hitherto forgotten 50-model collection in a "series of keyholes under the exhibit cases along a first-floor corridor&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt; Paula Holahan, one of the curators and the one who made the incredible discovery, correctly states that "It's not uncommon to find things packed away in any museum that is over 100 years old." But, regardless, the years have taken their toll and the specimens, currently too brittle to be publicly displayed, must remain in storage until conservation measures are funded and completed. Sadly though these funds are not materializing, so the museum hopes to one willing to sponsor the restoration before the effects of age become irreversible.&lt;ref name="news.wisc.edu"/&gt;

===Natural History Museum, Wollaston Hall, Nottingham, England===
There is a large display of marine invertebrates  and also two models of single cell animals living in fresh water.

==Lost works==
Many of the Glass sea creatures are yet to be located; the Leopolds' record books tell where many of the shipments went,&lt;ref&gt;https://dm.cmog.org/blaschka/blaschka_web.html&lt;/ref&gt; yet the condition and current whereabouts of the majority of these collections remains unknown. The original six glass sea anemones purchased by Professor Reichenbach in 1863 as well as the rest of that first collection were destroyed in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Natural History Berlin, Historical collection of pictures and writings – Katalog über Blaschka's Modelle, L.

[[Image:Decretals glossa.jpg|thumb|Decretals with Glossa ordinaria]]
The scholars of the 11th and 12th century legal schools in [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] are identified as '''glossators''' in a specific sense. They studied [[Roman law]] based on the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'', the ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' of [[Justinian I|Justinian]], the ''Authenticum'' (an abridged Latin translation of selected constitutions of Justinian, promulgated in Greek after the enactment of the ''Codex'' and therefore called ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]]''), and his law manual, the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones Iustiniani]]'', compiled together in the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]''. (This title is itself only a sixteenth-century printers' invention.) Their work transformed the inherited ancient texts into a living tradition of [[medieval Roman law]].

The glossators conducted detailed text studies that resulted in collections of explanations. For their work they used a method of study unknown to the Romans themselves, insisting that contradictions in the legal material were only apparent. They tried to harmonize the sources in the conviction that for every legal question only one binding rule exists. Thus they approached these legal sources in a [[dialectic]]al way, which is a characteristic of medieval [[scholasticism]]. They sometimes needed to invent new concepts not found in Roman law, such as [[half-proof]] (evidence short of full proof but of some force, such as a single witness). In other medieval disciplines, for example [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], glosses were also made on the main authoritative texts.

In the [[Greek language]], γλῶσσα (''glossa'') means "tongue" or "language." Originally, the word was used to denote an explanation of an unfamiliar word, but its scope gradually expanded to the more general sense of "commentary". The glossators used to write in the margins of the old texts (''glosa marginalis'') or between the lines (''glosa interlinearis'' - interlinear glosses). Later these were gathered into large collections, first copied as separate books, but also quickly written in the margins of the legal texts. The medieval copyists at [[Bologna]] developed a typical script to enhance the legibility of both the main text and the glosses. The typically Bolognese script is called the [[Littera Bononiensis]].

[[Accursius]]'s ''[[Glossa ordinaria]]'', the final standard redaction of these glosses, contains around 100,000 glosses. Accursius worked for decades on this task. There exists no critical edition of his glosses.

The medieval lawyers also wrote glosses on the medieval texts of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] such as the [[Decretum Gratiani]] (around 1140), the ''Liber Extra'' of [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]] (1234), the ''Liber Sextus'' of [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]] (1298) and later smaller collections of papal [[decretals]], verdicts in letter form sent to papal delegates. The decrets of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215, too, have received glosses.

In the older historiography of the medieval ''learned law'', the view developed that after the standard gloss had become fixed a generation of so-called ''[[commentator (historical)|commentators]]'' started to take over from the glossators. In fact, the early medieval legal scholars, too, wrote commentaries and lectures, but their main effort was indeed creating glosses.

Most of the older glosses are accessible only in medieval manuscripts: modern editions of only a few manuscripts exist. The main microfilm collections of glossed legal manuscripts are at the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History in Frankfurt am Main, at the universities of Munich, Würzburg, Milan, Leyden and Berkeley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35648">The '''history of calendars''', means that people creating and using methods for keeping track of days and larger divisions of time, covers a practice with ancient roots.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of [[timekeeping]] that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the [[Neolithic]]. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the [[day]], the [[solar year]] and the [[lunation]].
[[Calendar]]s are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the [[Bronze Age]], dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]]. The [[Sumerian calendar]] was the earliest, followed by the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]], [[Assyrian calendar|Assyrian]] and [[Elamite]] calendars.

A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in the [[Iron Age]] archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and [[Babylonian calendar]]s. This includes the calendar of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as well as the [[Hebrew calendar]].

Calendars in antiquity were usually [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]]. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in the Etruscan period" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman calendar was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BCE. The [[Julian calendar]] was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years.
This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].

In the 11th century in [[Iran|Persia]], a calendar reform led by [[Omar Khayyam|Khayyam]] was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html|title=Khayyam biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"/&gt;

The [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the ''de facto'' calendar for secular purposes.

==Etymology==
The term ''calendar'' itself is taken from the ''[[calends]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the [[Roman calendar]], related to the verb ''calare'' "to call out", referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin ''calendarium'' meant "account book, register", as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month.

The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century. The spelling ''calendar'' is from [[Early Modern English]].

An alternative hypothesis connects "calendar" with [[Koledari]] in Slavic, pre-Christian tradition, which was later incorporated into Christmas. ''Kolo'' means "circle, cycle" and ''dar'' means "a gift".

==Prehistory==
A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the [[solar year]]).
This includes many [[megalithic]] structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the [[Neolithic]] period.

A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the [[Slatino furnace model]], has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey D., 2000, Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity, London:Routledge p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mesolithic]] arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in [[Warren Field]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a [[lunar calendar]] and was dubbed the "world's oldest known calendar" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809125949/http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vučedol culture#Oldest European calendar|Oldest European calendar]] is found near to [[Vukovar]] in modern-day Croatia. It is a ceramic vessel bearing inscribed ideograms of celestial objects.

==Ancient Near East==

The ancient [[Sumer]]ian calendar divided a year into 12 [[lunar month]]s of 29 or 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mesopotamiancalander.htm|title=Mesopotamia, Calendar|publisher=International World History Project|website=History-world.org|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each month began with the sighting of a new moon. Sumerian months had no uniform name throughout Sumer because of the religious diversity.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89368/calendar/60208/Babylonian-calendars|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|entry=Calendar|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in scribes and scholars referring to them as "the first month", "the fifth month" etc. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} To keep the lunar year of 354 days in step with the solar year of 365.242 days an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra month]] was added periodically, much like a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] [[leap year]].&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There were no weeks in the Sumerian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1947|last=Yust|first=Walter|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|page=576|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holy days and time off from work were usually celebrated on the first, seventh and fifteenth of each month. In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city.

==Antiquity==

===Babylonia and Persia===
{{further|Babylonian calendar|Zoroastrian calendar}}

Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the [[second millennium BCE]], predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet [[Zoroaster]], the first fully preserved calendar is that of the [[Achaemenid]]s.  Throughout recorded history, [[Persian people|Persians]] have been keen on the idea and importance of having a [[calendar]]. They were among the first cultures to use a [[solar calendar]] and have long favoured a solar over [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in [[Iranian culture]] and is closely related to the folklore regarding [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name=EI-C-i&gt;{{harv|Panaino|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a [[360-day calendar]] based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the [[pastoral]] year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====
{{main|Zoroastrian calendar}}
The first calendars based on [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BCE). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified [[Achaemenid Empire]] required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in [[Egypt]]ian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a [[yazata]] (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to [[Ahura Mazda]] and seven were named after the six [[Amesha Spentas]]. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, [[Tiri, Estonia|Tiri]] and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, [[Sraosha]] (Soroush, yazata of prayer), [[Rashnu]] (the Judge), [[Fravashi]], [[Verethragna|Bahram]] (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and [[Vayu-Vata|Vata]], the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, [[Daena]] (yazata of religion and personified conscious), [[Ashi]] (yazata of fortune) and [[Arshtat]] (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to [[Asman]] (lord of sky or Heaven), [[Zam]] (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The [[Parthia]]ns (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the [[Middle Persian]] names used by the [[Sassanians]]. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, [[Ardashir I]], abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian.   This involved a correction to the places of the ''gahanbar'', which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed.   These were placed eight months later, as were the ''epagemonai'', the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name.   Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.

==== The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century ====

[[Toghril Beg]], the founder of the [[Seljuq dynasty]], had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to [[Khayyam]] from Malik-Shah and from his vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079.

Cowell quotes [[The Calcutta Review]] No 59:-
''When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, [[Omar Khayyam|Omar]] was one of the eight learned men employed to do it, the result was the Jalali era (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names) - 'a computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'''

Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greece===
The Greeks, as early as the time of [[Homer]], appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month ''Embolimos'' or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. 
Thus, the first day or new moon was called ''Noumenia''. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc.

The [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] was a [[lunisolar]] calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in every other year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ginzel: Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie |year=1911 |volume=2 |publisher=F.K. |location=Germany |pages= 335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In addition to their regular, "festival" calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This "conciliar" calendar divided the year into "[[prytanies]]", one for each of the "[[phylai]]", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the [[Julian calendar]].

The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the [[Olympic Games]] from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Davies267"&gt;Davies, p 267&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

===Hellenistic period===
{{further|Roman calendar}}

The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the [[Hellenistic period]], with separate traditions in every Greek state.
Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of [[Delphi]], because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

The Macedonian Era of the Seleucids, which began with the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Seleucus Nicator]] in 312 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It became widely used in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[Jews]] knew it as the "era of contracts", and used it in Europe until the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the [[List of Roman consuls|sitting consuls]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Romans from the same family often had the same ''praenomen'', which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;  The Romans had an [[Nundinae|eight-day week]], with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a ''nundinum'' or 'nine-day' in [[inclusive counting]].

Most of the regional [[Hindu calendar]]s are inherited  from a system standardized in classical [[Hindu astronomy]] 
as adopted via [[Indo-Greek]] transmission in the final centuries BCE, and  reformed by [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] astronomers such as [[Āryabhaṭa]] and [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]].

===China===
{{main|Chinese calendar}}
Before the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (before 770 BC), the Chinese Calendars were solar calendars.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the so-called  [[Wu Xing|five-phase]] calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. 
During the [[Warring States period]] (~475-220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In [[Qin China]], the Qin calendar ({{zh|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu's calendar, but the months order follows the Xia's calendar.

===Ancient India ===
{{main|Hindu calendar}} 
Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and ''Jyotisha'' was the Vedic era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHCe48QSZaUC|year=1860|publisher=Williams and Norgate|pages=210–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit–English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Jyotisha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as ''Panchanga'', is a collective term for the various [[lunisolar calendar]]s traditionally used in [[Hinduism]]. They adopt a similar underlying concept for timekeeping, but differ in their relative emphasis to moon cycle or the sun cycle, the names of months and when they consider the New Year to start.&lt;ref name=richmond80&gt;{{Cite book|title=Time Measurement and Calendar Construction|publisher= Brill Archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwEVAAAAIAAJ| accessdate=2011-09-18| year= 1956|author= B.

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remains in use by the [[Hindu]]s in India and Nepal particularly to set the Hindu festival dates. Early Buddhist and Jain communities of India adopted the ancient Hindu calendar, later Vikrami calendar and then local [[Buddhist calendar]]s. Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] festivals continue to be scheduled according to a lunar system in the luni-solar calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Ganeri|title=Buddhist Festivals Through the Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-EawToG-6YC&amp;pg=PT11|year=2003|publisher=BRB|isbn=978-1-58340-375-4|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-392-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

===Roman Empire===
{{main|Julian calendar}}
The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with [[Martius (month)|March]]. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]] for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[New Year]] in 709 AUC &lt;!--Book typo as 707 AUC--&gt; began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the "leap year" in 757 AUC (AD 4){{Fix|text=conversion is 1 year out}}.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The resultant [[Julian calendar]] remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582,&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] introduced the ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the [[Dionysian era]] in the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian period]].

In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]] and [[Publius Vatinius]] could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of [[Julius Caesar|Caius Julius Caesar]], with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC).&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The seven-day [[week]] has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the "planetary week" which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also [[names of the days of the week]]).

(British Library Add MS 42131, fol. 3r, early 15th century)]]

===Christian Europe===

{{main|Anno Domini}}
For the first six centuries since the birth of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], European countries used various local systems to count years, most usually [[regnal year]]s, modeled on the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In some cases, [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]] was also used. In the 6th century, the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] devised the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system, dating from the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] used another [[Latin]] term, "''ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus''" ("the time before the Lord's true incarnation", equivalent to the [[English language|English]] "before Christ"), to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |language=Latin | author=[[Bede]] |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml|publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], even Popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]], and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In 1267, the medieval scientist [[Roger Bacon]] stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (''horae'', ''minuta'', ''secunda'', ''tertia'', and ''quarta'') after noon on specified calendar dates.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Opus Majus]] of Roger Bacon'', tr. Robert Belle Burke (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928, reprinted 2000) table facing page 231, {{ISBN|978-1-85506-856-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a third for {{frac|1|60}} of a second remains in some languages, for example [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ثالثة, the modern second is further divided [[decimal]]ly.

Rival [[calendar era]]s to ''Anno Domini'' remained in use in Christian Europe.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In Spain, the "Era of the Caesars" was dated from Octavian's conquest of Iberia in 39 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was adopted by the [[Visigoths]] and remained in use in [[Catalonia]] until 1180, [[Crown of Castile|Castille]] until 1382 and Portugal until 1415.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For both Christians and [[Jews]], the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or ''[[Annus Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name="Davies268"&gt;Davies, p 268&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] world until modern times.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the [[Church of England]], under [[Archbishop Ussher]] in 1650, would pick 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt;

===Bulgar calendar===
The [[Bulgar calendar]] was a calendar system used by the [[Bulgars]], a seminomadic people, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the Eurasian steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga. In 681 part of the Bulgars settled in the Balkan peninsula and established Bulgaria. The main source of information used for reconstruction of the Bulgar calendar is a short 15th century transcript, which contains 10 pairs of calendar terms, the same dating system being found in a marginal note of a manuscript from the 10th c. According to the reconstructed calendar, the Bulgars used a 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the one adopted by Turkic peoples from the [[Chinese calendar]], with names and numbers that are deciphered as in Bulgar language.

===Islamic calendar===
The [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year.

===Icelandic calendar===
{{main|Icelandic calendar}}
In medieval Iceland, a calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient [[Germanic calendar]]s were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced  a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of "leap weeks" instead of the Julian leap days.

===Indo-Islamic calendars===
{{See also|Fasli calendar}} 
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] asked his royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar).&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amartya Sen]], Akbar's official calendar "Tarikh-ilahi" with the zero year of 1556 CE was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars. It was not used much in India outside of Akbar's Mughal court, and after his death the calendar he launched was abandoned. However, adds Sen, there are traces of the "Tarikh-ilahi" that survive in the Bengali calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amartya Sen|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bKvAAAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-10583-9|pages=319–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th century Hindu king [[Shashanka]].&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=meghna&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nitish K.

==Mesoamerica==
{{main|Mayan calendar}}
Of all the ancient calendar systems, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] systems are the most complex. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or ''tzolkin'', and the 365-day Vague Year, or ''haab''.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |title=Maya civilization |accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher=Civilization.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305074426/http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |archivedate=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D20-Ajaw.png|thumb|right|200px|A modern pictogram of the Mayan god [[Kinich Ahau|Ahau]], after which the 20th day of the ''tzolkin'' cycle was named]]
The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]], consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as [[Uayeb]], and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a "bundle" and was similar to a modern-day century.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

==Modern calendars==
{{further|List of calendars|Calendar reform}}
While the [[Gregorian calendar]] is  now in worldwide use for secular purposes, various medieval or ancient calendars remain in regional use for religious or social purposes, including the [[Julian calendar]], the [[Hebrew calendar]], the [[Islamic calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] etc.

There are also various modern calendars that see limited use, either created for the use of [[new religious movement]]s or reformed versions of older religious calendars, or calendars introduced by regionalist or nationalist movements.

The '''Institute for History of Musical Reception and Interpretation''' (IMRI) is a musicological research institute at the [[Mozarteum|University Mozarteum Salzburg]].

== Objectives ==
The institute was founded in June 2006 by Joachim Brügge, [[Wolfgang Gratzer]], and Thomas Hochradner and is concerned with selected topics on the interpretation and reception of music (in a project-related way). This should account for a [[self-concept]] of an [[Art school|Art University]] that sees musical practice and musicological reflection as equally creative activities that stimulate, correct and confirm each other.&lt;br /&gt;
Within the scope of a comprehensive music-historical approach, courses, projects, lectures, symposia, and publications of the institute’s members deal with exemplary and symptomatic processes of [[music#Performance|musical interpretation]] and reception. An emphasis is put on the examination of [[Mozart|Wolfgang Amadé Mozart’s]] effective history.
The institute’s name should reflect a distinction between forms of musical interpretation (artistic adaptations as performances or composed arrangements) and forms of musical reception (examination of music through science or press).

==Institute’s series ''klang-reden''==
* 2008
:''Mozart’s last three symphonies. Stations of their interpretational history'' (klang-reden 1), Joachim Brügge, Wolfgang Gratzer und Thomas Hochradner (eds.), Freiburg/Br.: Rombach

:''“Mozart” as challenge. Composing among the shades of canonical music'' (klang-reden 2), Wolfgang Gratzer (ed.), Freiburg/Br.: Rombach

'''Landscape planning''' is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing [[land use]]s while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and [[natural resources]]. [[park system|Park systems]] and [[greenway (landscape)|greenways]] of the type designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned [[mineral extraction]] was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

==In Asia==
In India, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the [[Vedas]] and to the [[Vaastu Shastra]]s. These ancient texts set forth principles for planning settlements, temples and other structures in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. Relationships with mountains (the home of the gods) and with rivers (regarded as goddesses) were of particular importance. A square form represented the earth and a circular form represented heaven. A [[mandala]] explained the relationship between heaven and earth. Square plans, for both secular and religious structures, were set out with their sides facing north, south, east and west. The earliest surviving stone temple set out in this way is [[Sanchi]].

In China, landscape planning originated with [[Feng Shui]], which is translated into English as 'wind and water' and is used to describe a set of general principles for the planning of development in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. The aim was to find the most auspicious environment possible, one sited in harmony with natural phenomena and the physical and psychological needs of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2T1mScdj8CYC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 0300095597|language = en|first = Nancy Shatzman|last = Steinhardt|first2 = Xinian|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
In [[Europe]], the history of landscape planning can be traced to the work of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|url = http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/garden_landscape_design_articles/landscape_theory/vitruvius|website = www.gardenvisit.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the planning of towns, he wrote about site planning with regard to microclimate, about the planning of streets and about the role of metaphor in design. Vitruvius' theories were revived during the renaissance and came to influence the planning of towns throughout Europe and the Americas. [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Public and Private Spaces of the City|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thmCAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2003-09-02|isbn = 1134519850|language = en|first = Ali|last = Madanipour}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the [[Place des Vosges]]. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space ([[public park]]s within towns). [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a [[park system]]s in Boston - the famous [[Emerald Necklace]]. [[Patrick Abercrombie]] took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London.

==In the US ==
In the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with [[urban planner|urban planners]]. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national [[land use planning]] system. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Ian McHarg]] are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of [[GIS]] and to the foundation of [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] by [[Jack Dangermond]].

==Legislation==
The principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] was influenced by the work of [[Ian McHarg]] on [[Environmental impact assessment]]. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the [[European Landscape Convention]] has wide-ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The [[Three Gorges Dam]], for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible.

==Theory==
{{Disputed-section|The Broads|date=December 2012}}
Landscape planners are concerned with the 'health' of the landscape, just as doctors are concerned with bodily health. This analogy can be taken further. Medical doctors advise both on the health of individuals and on matters of public health. When individuals take actions injurious to their own health this is regarded as a private matter. But if they take actions injurious to public health, these actions are properly regulated by law. The [[collective landscape]] is a [[public good]] which should be protected and enhanced by legislation and public administration. If, for example, mineral extraction has a damaging impact on the landscape, this is a proper field for intervention. Negative impacts on the landscape could include visual impacts, ecological impacts, hydrological impacts and recreational impacts. As well as protecting existing public goods, societies are responsible for the creation of new public goods. This can be done by positive landscape planning. There are, for example, many former mineral workings (e.g. the [[Norfolk Broads]]) which have become important public goods. Medical doctors are trained in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] etc. before becoming practitioners. Landscape doctors are trained in [[geomorphology]], [[hydrology]], [[ecology]] etc. before becoming practitioners in design and planning. When qualified, they can specialize in areas of landscape planning:
*[[Landscape of roads]] - The landscape treatment of roads is concerned with the planning and design of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s with regard to their [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] on the surrounding landscape. Sylvia Crowe wrote a pioneering book on the design of roads with regard to their impact on the landscape and Ian McHarg proposed an overlay system for highway route selection in his book on ''Design with nature''. In addition, the role of landscape, natural and ecological features and values especially natural and man-made infrastructure networks is hence quite important when planning strategic and macro policies, given that urban and inter-urban access networks are amongst the most important infrastructures in regional national and international levels. From the landscape point of view, ''general highway landscape frameworks'' must be formulated with respect to environmental needs ecological conditions and visual attractions, and particularly road edges. This can underlie quality-oriented planning and landscape design in many highways in regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=Taghvaei&gt;Taghvaei, S-Hassan "Importance of Highway and Expressway Landscape Design." ''Journal of The Urban Development and Organization: Haft Shahr'', '''4''', No. 55-56. Autumn, 2016. 10–30. [www.haftshahrjournal.ir/article_26567_aedaa43a6bea0c726a9f973112885ee1.pdf. Accessed 10 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Landscape of forestry]] - The '''landscape treatment of forests''' is concerned with the non-timber objectives which can be obtained by conserving and developing forests: scenic quality, water quality, recreation, [[wildlife management|wildlife conservation]] and other [[environmental good]]s. This work is done by foresters who also hold qualifications in [[landscape architecture]] and also by landscape architects and landscape planners with a specialization in forestry. The [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Forestry Commission|UK Forestry Commission]] and other forest agencies are also employers of landscape architects. They have mitigated criticism of [[plantation|plantation forestry]], [[monoculture]], and [[clear-cutting]].
*[[Landscape of energy]] - The generation of energy has become a major land use with consequent [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impacts]] upon the landscape. Landscape planning for energy is concerned with designs and plans to mitigate the impact of power generation upon the landscape. This includes landscape planning for:
** [[power stations]]
** [[Power transmission|power transmission lines]]
** [[hydroelectric power]]
** [[tidal power]]
** [[solar power]]
** [[wind power]]
*[[Landscape of urbanization]] - Most of the world's cities are expanding into agricultural land. Landscape planning for [[urbanization]] is concerned with the conservation and development of landscape resources as urbanization takes place. [[Ian McHarg|Ian McHarg's]] approach to this problem was to prepare a series of overlay maps showing the different types of quality in the land around settlements: agricultural value, property value, hydrological value, scenic value, recreational value, ecological value etc. The maps of value were then overlaid to produce a composite map which looked like an X-Ray photograph - with the dark areas having the most value and the white areas the least value. His belief was that the 'white land' should be urbanized in preference to the 'black land'. The overlay mapping system which McHarg proposed is now carried out using a [[Geographic Information System]]. Other landscape planners have proposed [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] and [[green belt]]s as a means of [[Growth management|urban growth management]].
*[[Landscape Urbanism]] is a theory of [[urbanism]] arguing that [[landscape]], rather than [[architecture]], is more capable of organizing the city and enhancing the urban experience.
*[[Landscape of recreation]] - Recreation has become a large-scale landuse. In the coastal regions of many countries (e.g. [[Spain]] and [[Denmark]]) it is the dominant land use and has had an enormous impact on the natural landscape. The landscape of [[recreation]] is concerned with mitigating the [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact]] of recreation on the landscape. [[Landscape architects]] and landscape planners work on the landscape of recreation to:
** reclaim landscapes which have been damaged by recreational use
** carry out [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessments]] of [[recreation resource planning|recreational development proposals]]
** prepare landscape plans and designs for recreation projects
*[[Landscape of mineral extraction]] - Mineral extraction has a long history of damaging the landscape. Harm has been caused to scenic quality, water quality, habitat quality and other [[environmental good]]s. The landscape treatment of mineral workings is concerned with:
** the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of abandoned [[mining|mines]] and [[quarry|quarries]]
** the planning and design of future mineral workings to minimize their harmful [[environmental impact analysis|environmental impact]] and achieve as many positive impacts on the environment as possible.
*[[Landscape of agriculture]] - The primary purpose of agriculture is food production but concern for other objectives (e.g. wildlife, conservation, biodiversity, recreation and scenery) have a long history and are of increasing importance in wealthy and urbanized countries. The European Union Set-Aside Policy was designed as a means of giving money to farmers to produce non-food environmental goods from farmland. Landscape planners are involved with the preparation of agricultural landscape plans for the achievement of non-food objectives from agricultural land.
*[[River reclamation|Landscape of rivers]] - The construction of new buildings and new roads accelerates the discharge of surface water runoff and raises flood peaks in the lower reachers of river catchments. River banks therefore have to be raised and flood channels have to be constructed. The adoption of [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] facilitates the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of rivers. When water is detained, infiltrated and transpired near to the where it falls, flood peaks are lowered and rivers can be reclaimed. The high concrete walls in which they were confined can be replaced by vegetated embankments. Water quality is improved and wildlife returns to the river. Projects to achieve these objectives are described as River Reclamation or River Restoration.

*[[Landscape of archaeology]] - The landscape of archaeology is concerned with the landscape treatment of archaeological sites. This involves analysis, discussion, the formulation of policies and the preparation of landscape designs relating a number of issues. In Britain the former Ministry of Public Works and Buildings (MPBW) (now [[English Heritage]], [[Cadw]], [[Historic Scotland]] and [[Environment and Heritage Service|Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service]]) had a policy of treating archaeological sites like highly manicured gardens. The grass was maintained almost to the quality of a bowling green. The standard of care was admirable but there was little or no regard to the former landscape character of the archaeological site. The development of the discipline of [[landscape archaeology]] has awakened interest in this question because the wider landscape is seen, correctly, as having archaeological value. Most historic societies earned their livelihood from working the land. Their buildings were an important accessory to the use of the land. In countries where the looting of archaeological sites is a problem, there is a tendency for them to be surrounded with chain links or other security fencing. This detracts from the relationship between the site and its landscape setting. In other countries, archaeological sites have become important visitor attractions and sources of revenue. This has led to the building of tourist facilities (visitor centres, hotels etc.) which can easily have a detrimental impact on the archaeological site and its landscape setting.

In each case, the aim is to take a specialist land use and make recommendations for what can be done to enhance its implact on the stock of [[environmental good]]s.

==Methodology==
The conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are:

*Identification of problems and opportunities.
*Establishment of goals.
*Inventory and analysis of the biophysical environment.
*Human community inventory and analysis.
*Development of concepts and the selection of options.
*Adoption of a plan.
*Community involvement and education.
*Detailed design.
*Plan implementation.
*Plan administration.

Landscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that "planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape". (Steiner, 1991)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11819">A '''law  degree''' is an academic degree conferred for studies in [[law]]. Such degrees are generally preparation for legal careers; but while their curricula may be reviewed by legal authority, they do not themselves confer a license. A legal license is granted (typically by examination) and exercised locally; while the law degree can have local, international, and world-wide aspects- e.g., in Britain the [[Legal Practice Course]] is required to become a British [[solicitor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/becomingasolicitor.law|title=Becoming a Solicitor|publisher=The Law Society (UK)|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sra.org.uk/students/students.page|title=Solicitor's Regulation Authority Student and Training information|publisher=Solicitor's Regulation Authority|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) to become a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |title=How to Become a Barrister |publisher=The Bar Council (UK) |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134750/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/trainingandeducation/howtobecomeabarrister/ |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees-and the first law degrees were [[doctorate]]s. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the [[glossators]] of the 11th century, which were schools of law.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, et al. (1915). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]. New York: Encyclopedia Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European university, that of [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the [[glossator]] school in that city. It is from this history that it is said that the first academic title of doctor applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; And at the [[University of Bologna]] from its founding in the 12th century until the end of the 20th century the only degree conferred was the doctorate, usually earned after five years of intensive study after secondary school. The rising of the doctor of philosophy to its present level is a modern novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, A. (1921). "Training for the Public Profession of the Law, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin 15." Boston: Merrymount Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its origins, a doctorate was simply a qualification for a [[guild]]—that of teaching law.&lt;ref&gt;van Ditzhuyzen, R. (2005). [http://ugle.svf.uib.no/svfweb1/filer/1309.pdf The 'creatio doctoris': Diversity or convergence of ceremonial forms]? Unknown publisher. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Bologna]] served as the model for other law schools of the [[medieval]] age.&lt;ref&gt;García y García, A. (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA399&amp;lpg=RA1-PA399&amp;dq=bologna+doctor+title&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ov98N_ekq2&amp;sig=nAvm4JUEZJg389NCdSNfX1Gc-7s&amp;hl=en#PPP1,M1 "The Faculties of Law,"] [[A History of the University in Europe]], London: Cambridge University Press. Accessed May 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of [[Roman law]] (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court) and although the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]] did teach [[canon law]] until the [[English Reformation]], its importance was always superior to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;García y García (1992), 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval Islamic [[madrasah]]s, there was a doctorate in the Islamic law of the [[Sharia]], called the ''[[Ijazah|ijazat attadris wa 'l-ifta']]'' ("license to teach and issue legal opinions").&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, G. (1989). "Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West," Journal of the American Oriental Society 109, 2, pp. 175–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of degrees==
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction.  Some examples include;

[[Image:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|right|thumb|A typical Juris Doctor diploma from the United States, here from [[Suffolk University Law School]] in 2008.]]

* ''[[Bacharel em Direito]]'' (Bachelor of Laws) or ''[[Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais]]'' (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in [[Brazil]], is an undergraduate degree. The abbreviation for Bachelor is ''Bel.''. To be a Lawyer and be admitted at the [[Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil]] (Brazilian Bar Association), the Bachelor must be approved at the Brazilian Bar Exam, if the Selection and Registration Committee accept the new member he/she will be consider an [[Advogado]] (Attorney at Law/Advocate).
* [[Bachelor of Laws]] also referred to as a B.A. in Law (B.L.) or an LL.B. (Hons) in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.  It is an [[undergraduate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Langbein, “Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons,” Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?, Oxford University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] (B.C.L.) degree is similar in nature, historically distinguished from [[canon law]].
* [[Master of Laws]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and various current or former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister. It is an advanced academic degree pursued by those holding a professional law degree or a degree in a relevant field.
* ''[[Laurea]] di Dottore in Giurisprudenza'' for graduates before the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, or ''[[Laurea Magistrale]] in  Giurisprudenza'' after the [[Bologna Process]] reforms, in [[Italy]].  It is a masters level degree,&lt;ref&gt;See University of Ferrarra. [http://www.unife.it/giurisprudenza/ls.giurisprudenza Faculty of Law] (in Italian). Accessed January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however all graduates of Italian universities, even of the undergraduate degree, are authorized to use the title of "dottore" (Italian for doctor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/lexs/1938/lexs_112065.html Regio Decreto 4 giugno 1938, n.1269] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809170627/http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/nir/lexs/1938/lexs_112065.html |date=2009-08-09 }}, Art. 48. (in Italian). Accessed February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Erstes Juristisches [[Staatsexamen]]'' is the equivalent to the law degree, since the second part ''(Zweites Juristisches Staatsexamen)'' is the German equivalent to the [[Bar exam]] in the U.S. At some universities you either become a "Lizentiat des Rechts (Licentiatus iuris)", a ''Magister iuris'' or a ''Diplom-Jurist''.  It is a master's-level degree.&lt;ref&gt;Free University of Berlin. [http://www.fu-berlin.de/studium/infoseite/abschluesse.html#exam Bachelor, Diploma and Staatsexamen] (in German). Accessed January 5, 2008.  See also [[Staatsexamen]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Juris Doctor]]'' (J.D.) in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] (also offered at some schools in [[Juris Doctor#Canada|Canada]], [[Juris Doctor#Australia|Australia]], and [[Juris Doctor#Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]).  It is a professional doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;Association of American Universities Data Exchange. [http://www.pb.uillinois.edu/aaude/documents/graded_glossary.doc Glossary of Terms for Graduate Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304031242/http://www.pb.uillinois.edu/aaude/documents/graded_glossary.doc |date=2009-03-04 }}.

* ''[[Legum Doctor]]'' (known as the LL.D., or in some jurisdictions [[Doctor of Laws]]) is in some jurisdictions the highest academic degree in law and is equivalent to a Ph.D., and in others is an honorary degree only.
* ''[[Doctor of Juridical Science]]'' (S.J.D.) is a research doctorate in law awarded mostly in the United States and Canada.
* ''[[Licentiate (degree)|Licenciado]] en Derecho'' ("[[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] in Law") in [[Spain]]. 
* ''[[Licenciatura#Mexico|Licenciatura]] en Derecho'' ("Bachelor in Law") in [[Mexico]].  
* ''[[Licentiate (degree)|Lizentiat]] der Rechtswissenschaften'' ([[German language|German]]) / ''Licence en droit'' ([[French language|French]]) until 2004 and ''Master of Law (MLaw)'' since 2004 (as a result of the [[Bologna Process]]) in [[Switzerland]].  It is a masters level degree.
* ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]] iuris (Mag. iur.)'' ("Master of Law") in [[Austria]] and [[Croatia]].  It is a masters level degree and the first academic title within both systems. After three years of practice you can take the "Anwaltsprüfung" (in Austria) or "Pravosudni ispit" (in Croatia), an equivalent of the bar exam.
* [[Specialist degree|Specialist]] in law or [[Jurist]] in [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]].  It is a graduate degree which allows doing a PhD research after admission to the PhD department (aspirantura), though formally it is not at the masters level.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Pogodina and Ruslan Sadovnikov.

Northwestern University School of Law, Career Center. Accessed January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Finnish title of ''[[varatuomari]]'' is the basic qualification for the legal profession. It is obtained by an one-year [[externship]] at a district court after completing a Master's degree in law in a university.

'''Liudmila Grigorievna Kovnatskaya''' (born 5 February 1941) is a Russian musicologist. She is a professor at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov]] (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.

==Education==
She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.

==Professional experience==
Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers’ Union]], and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).

In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for "The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.

Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about [[Benjamin Britten]] (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and [[Saint Cecilia]], patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.

Prof Kovnatskaya’s research fields include [[Music of Russia|History of Russian Music]]; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on [[Dmitri Shostakovich|D. Shostakovich]]. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).

Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.

A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

The '''National Endowment for the Humanities''' ('''NEH''') is an independent federal agency of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;government]], established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 ({{USPL|89|209}}), dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the [[humanities]]. The NEH is housed at 400 7th St SW, [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/visiting-neh | title=Visiting NEH | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 2014, NEH was at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[Old Post Office Pavilion|Nancy Hanks Center at the Old Post Office]].

==History and overview==
The NEH provides grants for high-quality humanities projects to cultural institutions such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, public television, and radio stations, and to individual scholars.

NEH was created in 1965 under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, which included the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and later the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services|Institute for Museum Services]], as a move to provide greater investment in culture by the federal government.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/history | title=How NEH Got Its Start | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEH was based upon recommendation of the National Commission on the Humanities, convened in 1963 with representatives from three US scholarly and educational associations.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"/&gt;

The agency creates incentives for excellent work in the humanities by awarding grants that strengthen teaching and learning in the humanities in schools and colleges across the nation, facilitate research and original scholarship, provide opportunities for lifelong learning, preserve and provide access to cultural and educational resources and to strengthen the institutional base of the humanities. As part of its mandate to support humanities programs in every US state and territory, the agency supports a network of private, nonprofit affiliates, the [[list of state humanities councils|56 humanities councils in the states and territories of the United States]].

The ninth NEH Chair was [[Jim Leach]]. President Obama nominated the former Iowa congressman, a Republican, to chair the NEH on June 3, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/arts/04neh.html "Obama Names a Republican to Lead the Humanities Endowment"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Senate confirmed his appointment in August 2009.&lt;ref name="Landesman"&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/rocco-landesman-confirmed-as-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-arts/ "Rocco Landesman Confirmed as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts"], ''New York Times'', August 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach began his term as the NEH Chair on August 12, 2009 and stepped down in May 2013. Between November 2009 and May 2011, Leach conducted the American "Civility Tour" to call attention to the need to restore reason and civility back into politics, a goal that in his words was "central to the humanities." Leach visited each of the 50 states, speaking at venues ranging from university and museum lecture halls to hospitals for veterans, to support the return of non-emotive, civil exchange and rational consideration of other viewpoints. According to Leach, "Little is more important...than establishing an ethos of thoughtfulness and decency of expression in the public square. Words reflect emotion as well as meaning. They clarify—or cloud—thought and energize action, sometimes bringing out the better angels in our nature, sometimes lesser instincts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/29/AR2009112902014.html | title=E.J. Dionne Welcomes Jim Leach's Call for Civility | publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 November 2009 | accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the completion of Leach's Civility Tour, rallies for reasoning politics like [[Jon Stewart]]'s [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity]] and grassroots initiatives for [[Pluralistic Rationalism|pluralistic rationalism]] in public discourse, have reflected Leach's call for civil, non-emotive and reasoning language between those with disparate religious or political ideologies.&lt;ref name="ICC3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202190225/http://www.twincities.com/2014/08/03/st-pauls-atheists-are-coming-out-of-the-closet/ "St. Paul's atheists are coming out of the closet," Bob Shaw, ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', August 4, 2014]. Retrieved August 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth Chair of the NEH was [[William Drea Adams|William 'Bro' Adams]], who served from 2014 to 2017. President Obama nominated Adams on April 4, 2014;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2014-04-10 | title=President Obama Announces his Intent to Nominate Dr. William "Bro" Adams as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/254802741.html | title=Obama nominates William 'Bro' Adams to be next head of National Endowment for the Humanities | work=Minneapolis Star Tribune | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colby.edu/news/2014/04/10/adams-tapped-by-president-obama/ | title=Adams Tapped by President Obama | publisher=Colby College | accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on July 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/senate-confirms-head-of-us-humanities-endowment/2014/07/09/133baaf6-0796-11e4-9ae6-0519a2bd5dfa_story.html | title=Senate confirms head of US Humanities Endowment | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams appointed Margaret (Peggy) Plympton as the Deputy NEH Chair in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman | title=Deputy Chair | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=25 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314183912/http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman | archivedate=14 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before Adams's appointment, the NEH was headed by Acting Chair [[Carole M. Watson]]. Adams resigned his appointment on May 23, 2017, when he cited accomplishments under the "Common Good" initiative and the appointment of new administration officials.&lt;ref name="Adams-resignation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2017-05-22 |title=NEH Chairman William D. Adams Announces Resignation |date=May 22, 2017  |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Endowment is directed by the [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH Chair]]. Advising the Chair is the National Council on the Humanities, a board of 26&amp;nbsp;distinguished private citizens who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="nch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-on-the-humanities | title=National Council on the Humanities | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council members serve staggered six-year terms.

===The NEH Chair===
The Endowment is directed by a [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|Chair]], who has legal authority to approve all recommendations and award grants and cooperative agreements. The Chair is nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The Chair's decisions are informed by recommendations from the National Council on the Humanities, peer-reviewers who are selected to read each project proposal submitted to the Endowment, as well as by the Endowment's staff.

===Major program offices===
The NEH has seven grant-making divisions and offices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions | title=Information about the Divisions and Offices that Administer NEH Grant Programs | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Division of Preservation and Access''' awards grants to preserve, maintain, and improve access to primary sources in the humanities, in both digital and analog form.
* '''The Division of Public Programs''' supports projects that bring the humanities to large audiences through libraries and museums, television and radio, historic sites, and digital media.
* '''The Division of Research''' makes awards to support the publication of books in and outside the humanities.
* '''The Division of Education''' works to support and strengthen teaching of the humanities.
* '''The Office of Federal/State Partnership''' collaborates with 56 state and territory humanities councils to strengthen local programs.
* '''The Office of Challenge Grants''' administers grants intended to support centers and endowments through fundraising by humanities institutions to further long-term stability. This Office was abolished by the Trump Administration in 2017.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* '''The Office of Digital Humanities''' advises on use of technology in the humanities and coordinates.

===Special initiatives===
These are special priorities of the endowment that indicate critical areas of the humanities as identified by the NEH Chair. They differ from the divisions of the endowment in that they do not sponsor or coordinate specific grant programs.

====Bridging Cultures initiative====
Bridging Cultures is an NEH initiative that explores ways the humanities promote understanding and mutual respect for people with diverse histories, cultures, and perspectives. Projects supported through this initiative focus on cultures globally as well as within the United States.&lt;ref name="bridging.cultures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/bridging-cultures | title=About the Bridging Cultures Initiative | accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International projects might seek to enlarge Americans' understanding of other places and times, as well as other perspectives and intellectual traditions. American projects might explore the great variety of cultural influences on, and myriad subcultures within, American society. 

These projects might investigate how Americans have approached and attempted to surmount seemingly unbridgeable cultural divides or examine the ideals of civility and civic discourse. In connection with a focus on civic discourse, projects might explore the role of women in America's civic life as well as the civic role of women in other cultures and regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

====Standing Together====
This initiative, launched in 2014, marks a priority to make awards that promote understanding of the military experience and to support returning veterans.&lt;ref name="neh.standing.together"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/veterans/standing-together | title=NEH Veterans Initiative | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====We the People====
''We the People'' was an NEH special funding stream initiated by NEH Chair Coles, using dedicated funds available to each Chair of the NEH, which was designed to encourage and enhance the teaching, study, and understanding of American history, culture, and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wethepeople.gov/ | title=We the People | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative supports projects and programs that explore significant events and themes in American nation's history, which advance knowledge of the principles that define America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |archivedate=2010-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302174451/http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |date=March 2, 2010 |title=The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NEH, the initiative led a renaissance in knowledge about American history and principles among all US citizens. The initiative was launched on Constitution Day, September 17, 2002 and active through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |title=About We the People |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185208/http://wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |archivedate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy projects==
Since 1965, the NEH has sponsored many projects, including:

==Awards==

===Jefferson Lecture===
{{Main article|Jefferson Lecture}}
Since 1972 the NEH has sponsored the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in the Humanities, which it describes as "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities." The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities. The honoree delivers a lecture in Washington, D.C., during the spring, and receives an honorarium of $10,000. The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Humanities Medal and Charles Frankel Prize===
{{Main article|National Humanities Medal}}
The National Humanities Medal, inaugurated in 1997, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities. Up to 12&amp;nbsp;medals can be awarded each year. From 1989 to 1996 the NEH awarded a similar prize known as the [[Charles Frankel]] Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html Awards and Honors] at NEH Website (retrieved January 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The new award, a bronze medallion, was designed by David Macaulay, the 1995 winner of the Frankel Prize.

==''Humanities'' magazine==
Starting in 1969, the NEH published a periodical called ''Humanities''; that original incarnation was discontinued in 1978. In 1980, ''Humanities'' magazine was relaunched ({{ISSN|0018-7526}}). It is published six times per year, with one cover article each year dedicated to profiling that year's Jefferson Lecturer. Most of its articles have some connection to NEH activities. The magazine's editor since 2007 has been journalist and author [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/septemberoctober/ednote/editor%25E2%2580%2599s-note-septemberoctober-2007|title=Editor’s Note, September/October 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 until her death in 2007, ''Humanities'' was edited by Mary Lou Beatty (who had previously been a high-ranking editor at the [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/marchapril/ednote/editors-note-marchapril-2007|title=Editor&amp;#039;s Note, March/April 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020802132.html|title=Mary Lou Beatty; Editor at NEH, Post|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=2007-02-09|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ottonian art''' is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was re-established under the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.  Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church.  However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 81–86; Lasko, 82; Dodwell, 123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from [[Byzantine art]] and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as "a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277"&gt;Honour and Fleming, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 004.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|"Roma", "Gallia", "Germania" and "Sclavinia" pay homage to Otto III, from the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], one of the "Liuthar group"]]

Following late Carolingian styles, "[[presentation miniature|presentation portraits]]" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art,&lt;ref&gt;in contrast, there are no surviving contemporary portraits of [[Charlemagne]] in manuscripts&lt;/ref&gt; and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of [[Late Antiquity]], such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic]], and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]]. This goal was accomplished in various ways.  For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 123; Imperial portraiture is a major subject in Garrison&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of [[spolia]] from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity.  This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and other building materials from the [[Palace of Theoderic]] in [[Ravenna]] and reused them in his new cathedral at [[Magdeburg]].  The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features.

In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain [[presentation miniature]]s depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St [[Pirmin]], founder of [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the "command structure" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solothurn]] Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89–90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140-141; Dodwell, 134; the [[Egbert Psalter]] also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byzantine art]] also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess [[Theophanu]] to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers.  However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times.  The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills,&lt;ref&gt;Or so it is usually assumed, but see Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt; some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen,&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and some [[lay brother]]s and lay assistants employed by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;An area where evidence is generally thin across Europe, see Cherry, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  While secular [[medieval jewelry|jewellery]] supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, [[ivory carving]] at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.

==Manuscripts==
[[File:CodexEgberti-Fol052v-ResurrectionOfLazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Egberti]], ''Resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'', "Ruodprecht group"]]
Ottonian monasteries produced most if not all of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.  The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;

In contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] devoted to "strips" in three tiers with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' and his [[Parables of Jesus|parables]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, throughout; Dodwell, 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich [[treasure binding]]s and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the "[[Eburnant group]]" were made, perhaps at [[Lorsch]], as several miniatures in the [[Gero Codex]] (now [[Darmstadt]]), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian [[Lorsch Gospels]].  This is the first stylistic group of the traditional "'''Reichenau school'''".  The two other major manuscripts of the group are the [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]] named for [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] and [[Petershausen Sacramentary|Petershausen]].  In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above "we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134, quoted; Beckwith, 92–93; compare the St John portraits in [[:File:Gero Codex Evangelist Johannes.jpg|the Gero Codex]] and [[:File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|the Lorsch Gospels]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 005.jpg|thumb|left|the ''[[Annunciation to the shepherds]]'' from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], "Liuthar group" of the "Reichenau school"]]
A number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the [[Reichenau Island|island monastery of Reichenau]] in [[Lake Constance]], despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there.  C.R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at [[Lorsch]] and Trier instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130, with his full views in: C.R. Dodwell et [[D. H. Turner]] (eds.), ''Reichenau reconsidered. A Re-assessment of the Place of Reichenau in Ottonian Art'', 1965, Warburg Surveys, 2, of which Backhouse is a review.  See Backhouse, 98 for German scholars dubious about the traditional Reichenau school.  Garrison, 15, supports the traditional view.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wherever it was located, the "Reichenau school" specialized in [[gospel book]]s and other [[liturgical book]]s, many of them, such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]] (c. 1000) and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001–1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World]] International Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/illuminated-manuscripts-from-the-ottonian-period-produced-in-the-monastery-of-reichenau-lake-constance/ |title=Illuminated manuscripts from the Ottonian period produced in the monastery of Reichenau (Lake Constance) |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important "Reichenau school" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books.&lt;ref&gt;Or at any rate, monks depicted and named in them. Whether these would actually have been the main scribes of the text is discussed by Mayr-Harting, 229&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Eburnant group" covered above was followed by the "Ruodprecht group" named after the scribe of the [[Egbert Psalter]]; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The [[Liuthar Gospels|Aachen Gospels of Otto III]], also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third "'''Liuthar group'''" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–144; Backhouse, throughout, is rather sceptical about Trier as a major centre; Beckwith, 96–104 stresses the mobility of illuminators.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding miniaturist of the "Ruodprecht group" was the so-called Master of the ''[[Registrum Gregorii]]'', or [[Gregory Master]], whose work looked back in some respects to [[Late Antique]] manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for "their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 141–142, 141 quoted; Lasko, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; He worked chiefly in [[Trier]] in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential ''[[Codex Egberti]]'', a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop [[Egbert of Trier]], probably in the 980s.  However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–142&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the "Liuthar group" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it "carried transcendentalism to an extreme", with "marked schematization of the forms and colours", "flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 104, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them  "emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance", with narrative scenes "presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 108–110, both quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This gestural "dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277" /&gt;

The group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], the best known and most extreme of the group, where "the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 112&lt;/ref&gt; The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.

[[File:CodexAureusEpternacensisf76fDetail.jpg|thumb|Labourers in the vineyard, from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]]]]

Two dedication miniatures added to the [[Egmond Gospels]] around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style.  In [[Regensburg]] [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] held the major Carolingian [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which probably influenced a style with "an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page", giving in the [[Uta Codex]] of c. 1020 complex schemes where "bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism.  This style was to be very influential on [[Romanesque art]] in several media.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 151–153; Garrison, 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echternach Abbey]] became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] were produced there, followed by the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III]] in 1045–46, which Henry presented to [[Speyer Cathedral]] (now [[Escorial]]), the major work of the school.  Henry also commissioned the [[Uppsala Gospels]] for the cathedral there (now in the university library).&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at [[Salzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 153–15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hildesheim]], [[Corvey]], [[Fulda]], and [[Cologne]], where the [[Hitda Codex]] was made.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130–156 covers the whole period, as does Beckwith, 92–124; Legner's three volumes have catalogue entries on considerable numbers of manuscripts made in Cologne, or now located there.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork and enamels==
[[File:Nürnberg — GNM 2013-09-07 Mattes (101).JPG|thumb|A corner of the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], [[Trier]], 980s]]

Objects for decorating churches such as crosses, [[reliquaries]], altar frontals and [[treasure binding]]s for books were all made of or covered by gold, embellished with gems, enamels, crystals, and cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, Part Two (pp. 77–142), gives a very comprehensive account.  Beckwith, 138–145&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by "beehive" projections in gold wire, and figurative [[relief]]s in [[repoussé]] gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration.  Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94–95; Henderson, 15, 202–214; see Head for an analysis of the political significance of reliquaries commissioned by Egbert of Trier.&lt;/ref&gt; In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the [[Celestial city]], and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various "scientific", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular [[lapidary (text)|lapidary books]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] after he outgrew it.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94-95; also this [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/465119 brooch] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|[[Curmsun Disc]] - Obverse, Jomsborg, 980s]]
Examples of ''[[crux gemmata]]'' or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]; several abbesses of [[Essen Abbey]] were Ottonian princesses. The [[Cross of Otto and Mathilde]], [[Cross of Mathilde]] and the [[Essen cross with large enamels]] were probably all given by [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen]] (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the [[Theophanu Cross]] came some fifty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 99–109; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Lothair]] ([[Aachen]]) and [[Imperial Cross]] ([[Vienna]]) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]. The book cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] ([[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]]) is in a very comparable style.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 59–60; Lasko, 98; Beckwith, 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in [[Trier]],&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 15; Lasko, 96–98; Head.&lt;/ref&gt; and gold altar frontals for the [[Palace Chapel, Aachen]] and [[Basel Cathedral]] (now in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 129–131; Beckwith, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or [[Ambon of Henry II]]. The late Carolingian upper cover of the  [[Lindau Gospels]] ([[Morgan Library]], New York) and the [[Arnulf Ciborium]] in [[Munich]] were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64–66; Beckwith, 50, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christussäule 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wedding at Cana]] on the [[Bernward Column]]]]

Large objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving [[wheel chandelier]]s from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]] from the period of Bishop [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]] (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach "the peaks of perfection".  The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the [[Bernward Doors]], with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 111–123, 119 quoted; Beckwith, 145–149&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a bronze columnm the [[Bernward Column]], over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the [[ministry of Jesus]] in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of [[Trajan's Column]] and other Roman examples.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 120-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing [[cloisonné]] enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to [[Essen]].  During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the ''[[senkschmelz]]'' or "sunk enamel" technique in addition to the ''[[vollschmelz]]'' one already used.  Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use ''vollschmelz'', with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in ''senkschmelz'', surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed.  The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 95–106; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Christ Magdeburg Cathedral Met 41.100.157.jpg|thumb|The "dedication" [[Magdeburg]] plaque]]

Much very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites.  There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 126–138; Lasko, 78–79, 94, 106–108, 112, 131, as well as the passages cited below&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of four Ottonian ivory [[situla (vessel)|situlae]] appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period.  Situlae were [[liturgy|liturgical]] vessels used to hold [[holy water]], and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An [[aspergillum]] was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects.  However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of [[elephant]] tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops.  All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the [[Basilewsky]] Situla of 920 in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], decorated with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' on two levels,&lt;ref&gt;Basilewsky Situla [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93850/situla-the-basilewsky-situla/ V&amp;A Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Situla of Gotofredo" of c. 980 in [[Milan Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/56/m_483a78b657804fbaa6842929d8126c39.jpg image of Milan situla]&lt;/ref&gt; one in the [[Aachen Cathedral]] Treasury,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |title=Image of Aachen situla |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722075610/http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/euwf/ho_17.190.45.htm Metropolitan Museum example]&lt;/ref&gt;  All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop [[Gotofredo I (archbishop of Milan)|Gotfredus]] presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, 26, though Lasko, 92 disagrees with this.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops.  This was probably made in [[Trier]] about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;All except the New York situla are illustrated and discussed in Beckwith, pp. 129–130, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Among various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] and two [[diptych]] wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with "an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 133-136, 135-136 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important group of [[plaquette|plaques]], now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] and are called the "Magdeburg plaques", the "plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium" or similar names.  They were probably made in [[Milan]] in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an [[antependium]] or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed.  Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York has a "dedication" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral.  Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set.  The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold.  Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 87–91; Williamson, 12; Beckwith, 126–129. On the function of the original object, Williamson favours a door, Lasko leans towards a pulpit, and Beckwith an antependium, but none seem emphatic in their preference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style of the figures is described by [[Peter Lasko]] as "very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions".&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall painting==
[[File:Reichenau Oberzell Fresko1.jpeg|thumb|Jesus and the [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|Gadarene swine]], nave fresco in St George, [[Oberzell]]]]

Although it is clear from documentary records that many churches were decorated with extensive cycles of wall-painting, survivals are extremely rare, and more often than not fragmentary and in poor condition. Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around [[Fulda]] in [[Hesse]]; though there are also important examples from north Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 127–128; Beckwith, 88–92&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a record of bishop [[Gebhard of Constance]] hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of [[Petershausen Abbey]], and laymen may have dominated the art of wall-painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators.  The artists seem to have been rather mobile: "at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130; the Italian was "Johannes Italicus", who one scholar has identified with the Gregory Master, see Beckwith, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of St George at Oberzell on [[Reichenau Island]] has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration.  The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]]; they are therefore usually dated around 980–1000.  Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 128–130; Beckwith, 88–92; Backhouse, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Larger sculpture==
[[File:Gerokreuz full 20050903.jpg|thumb|[[Gero Cross]], c. 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]]]

Very little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the [[Gero Cross]] (around 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 142; Lauer, Rolf, in Legner, III, 142 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] (about 1000, [[Essen Cathedral]], which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the [[Virgin and Child]], which is in wood which was covered with [[gesso]] and then thin gold sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 150–152 Lasko, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Monumental sculpture]] remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the [[stucco]] reliefs on the [[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] of [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]], and also on that in [[San Pietro al Monte]], [[Civate]], which relate to ivory carving of the same period,&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 132&lt;/ref&gt; and some stone sculpture.

==Survival and historiography==
Surviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements.  As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Legner, Vol 2 pp. 238-240, no. E32, where a largely rubbed-down 6th-century Byzantine bookcover plaque has on the original back a Cologne relief of c. 1000 ([[Schnütgen Museum]], Inv. B 98).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;  A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods.  Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above.  Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries.

The term "Ottonian art" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524–525&lt;/ref&gt; apart from [[Adolph Goldschmidt]]'s studies of ivories and sculpture in general.  A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations.  The 1950 Munich exhibition ''Ars Sacra'' ("sacred art" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by [[Peter Lasko]] in his book for the ''[[Penguin Books#Pelican History of Art|Pelican History of Art]]'', the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the "minor arts", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524; Lasko, xxii lists a number of the exhibitions up to 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field "that is still significantly under-represented in English-language art-historical research".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Page layout''' is the part of [[graphic design]] that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a [[Page (paper)|page]]. It generally involves organizational principles of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] to achieve specific communication objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Z|title=Elements and principles of design: Tools for digital imagery, art and design|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium.  It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize.  Low-level [[pagination]] and [[typesetting]] are more mechanical processes.  Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way.  Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always [[automation|automated]].  The result might be published as-is (as for a residential [[telephone directory|phone book]] interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a [[Magazine]].

Beginning from early [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] pages in hand-copied books of the [[Middle Ages]] and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

== History and layout technologies ==

==={{anchor|Direct physical layout|Page setting}}Direct physical page setting===

With [[manuscript]]s, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.

With ancient [[woodblock printing]], all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.

With the Renaissance invention of [[letterpress printing]] and cold-metal [[moveable type]], [[typesetting]] was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a [[composing stick]] into a galley—a long tray.  Any images would be created by [[engraving]].

The original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, [[markup language|markup]] would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called "manuscripts" and the markup process was the same.)

After the first round of typesetting, a [[galley proof]] might be printed in order for [[proofreading]] to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup.  The final layout would be constructed in a "form" or "forme" using pieces of wood or metal ("[[Furniture (typesetting)|furniture]]") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a [[Chase (typesetting)|chase]], and objects which lock down the frame known as [[quoins]].  This process is called [[imposition]], and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed.  An "imposition proof" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.

The invention of [[hot metal typesetting]] in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce [[Slug (typesetting)|slugs]]—entire lines of text—using a keyboard.  The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine.  The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.

===Paste-up era===
[[File:Editorial_office_of_Bild_newspaper,_West_Berlin,_1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Editor#Print media|Editors]] work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]],'' 1977 in [[West Berlin]]. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them. ]]
[[Offset lithography]] allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press.  This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed.  Type could be set with a [[typewriter]], or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine.  The [[IBM Selectric Composer]], for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including [[proportional font]]s), and with [[text justification]].  With [[photoengraving]] and [[halftone]], physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.

The layout process then became the task of creating the [[paste up]], so named because [[rubber cement]] or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper.  Completed pages become known as [[camera-ready]], "mechanical" or "mechanical art".

[[Phototypesetting]] was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up.  These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.

=== Computer-aided publishing ===

As the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set.  In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, [[cathode ray tube]]s were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of "flat screen" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Flat panel display]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

[[Printer (computing)|Printers]] attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a [[ditto machine]] or [[photocopier]]. [[WYSIWYG]] [[word processor]]s made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters.  Early [[dot matrix printing]] was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. [[Inkjet printing]] and [[laser printing]] did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.

With modern [[desktop publishing]] software such as flagship software [[Adobe Indesign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html|title=Buy Adobe InDesign CC - Desktop publishing software and online publisher|author=|date=|website=www.adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cloud-based [[Lucidpress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/tour/free-page-layout-software|title=Free Page Layout Software|author=|date=26 May 2015|website=lucidpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the layout process can occur entirely on-screen.  (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, "word processing" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.)  A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer).  Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas.  Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use [[computer to plate]] technology to skip the physical original entirely. [[PostScript]] and [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.

===Digital media (non-paper)===

Since the advent of [[personal computing]], page layout skills have expanded to [[electronic media]] as well as print media. [[E-book]]s, PDF documents, and static [[web page]]s mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add [[multimedia]] animation, and interactivity.  Page layout for [[interactive media]] overlaps with [[interface design]] and [[user experience]] design; an interactive "page" is better known as a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).

Modern web pages are typically produced using [[HTML]] for content and general structure, [[cascading style sheet]]s to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and [[JavaScript]] for interactivity.  Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a [[text editor]], or a special [[HTML editor]] which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids.  Additional technologies such as [[Macromedia Flash]] may be used for multimedia content. [[Web developer]]s are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate [[web designer]] may be responsible for establishing the layout.  A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.

===Projected pages===

Projected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.

The [[magic lantern]] and [[opaque projector]] were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of [[photographic film]] (one negative and one positive) or one [[reversal film]] can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. [[Intertitle]]s were used extensively in the earliest [[motion picture]]s when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous [[vanity card]]s and [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]].

It became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using [[overhead projector]]s in the 1940s, and [[slide projector]]s in the 1950s. [[Transparency (projection)|Transparencies]] for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers.  Computer [[presentation program]]s became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally.  Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using [[LCD]] overhead projectors.  Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a [[video projector]], [[computer monitor]], or [[Large-screen television technology|large-screen television]].

Laying out a [[presentation]] presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages.  Consideration might be given to:
* Sizing text and graphics so they can be seen from the back of the room, which limits the amount of information that can be presented on a single slide
* Using headers, footers, or repeated elements to make all pages similar so they feel cohesive, or indicate progress
* Using titles to introduce new topics or segments
* Pacing, so slides are changed at comfortable intervals, fit the length of the talk, and content order matches the speaker's expectation
* Providing a way for the speaker to refer to specific items on the page, such as with color, verbal labels, or a [[laser pointer]]
* Editing the information presented so it either repeats what the speaker is saying (so the audience can pay attention to either) or only presents information that cannot be conveyed verbally (to avoid dividing audience attention or simply reading slides directly)
* Use of animation to add emphasis, introduce information slowly, or be entertaining
* Making the slides useful for later reference if printed as handouts or posted online

== Grids versus templates ==
[[Grid (page layout)|Grid]]s and templates are page layout design patterns used in [[advertising campaign]]s and multiple-page publications, including [[website]]s.

A '''grid''' is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.

In contrast, a '''template''' is more rigid.  A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.

Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with [[Desktop publishing#Terminology|master page]] features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.

==Static versus dynamic layouts==
Static layouts allow for more control over the [[aesthetics]], and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In [[web design]], this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All [[Image file formats#Raster formats|raster image formats]] are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.

In contrast, electronic pages allow for [[dynamic publishing|dynamic layouts]] with swapping content, [[personalization]] of styles, text scaling, [[image scaling]], or [[reflowable document|reflowable]] content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to [[separation of presentation and content|separate presentation from content]], which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.

Static layout design may involve more graphic design and [[visual art]] skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more [[interactive design]] and [[content management]] skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.

[[Motion graphics]] don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants [[motion graphic design]] more than static graphic design or interactive design.

Electronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a [[web banner]] may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]] and flow content around contours.

==Front-end versus back-end==
With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between [[visual communication]]s ('''front-end''') and [[information technology]] ('''back-end'''). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require [[meta data]] for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data ([[meta tags]]) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.

More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the [[front and back ends|front-end]], and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as [[image editing software]] or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a "What You See Is What You Get" ([[WYSIWYG]]) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.

==Design elements and choices==

Page layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a [[Style guide|house style]] which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template.  There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).

Typical page layout decisions include:
* Size of page [[Margin (typography)|margins]]
* Size and position of images and figures
* Deciding on the number and size of [[Column (typography)|columns]] and gutters (gaps between columns)
* Placement of intentional [[White space (visual arts)|whitespace]]
* Use of special effects like overlaying text on an image, [[Runaround (typography)|runaround]] and intrusions, or [[Bleed (printing)|bleeding]] an image over the page margin
* Use of [[color printing]] or [[spot color]] for emphasis

Specific elements to be laid out might include:
* Chapter or section titles, or [[headline]]s and [[subhead]]s
* [[Photo caption|Image captions]]
* [[Pull quote]]s and [[nut graph]]s which might be added out of course or to make a short story fit the layout
* [[Boxout]]s and [[Sidebar (publishing)|sidebars]], which present information as asides from the main text flow
* [[Page header]]s and [[page footer]]s, the contents of which are usually uniform across content pages and thus automatically duplicated by layout software.  The [[page number]] is usually included in the header or footer, and software automatically increments it for each page.
* [[Table of contents]]
* [[Note (typography)|Notes]] like footnotes and end notes; [[bibliography]], for example in academic journals or textbooks

In newspaper production, final selection and [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor.  Likewise, [[headline]]s might be written by the layout editor, a [[copy editor]], or the original author.

To make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to [[typography]] elements like [[font size]] or [[leading]].

===Floating block===
A floating block in [[writing]] and [[publishing]] is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and [[table (information)|table]]s is a typical feature of [[academic writing]] and [[technical writing]], including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled ''figure'' (for pictures, diagrams, [[Plot (graphics)|plots]], etc.) and ''table''.  An alternative name for figure is '''image''' or '''graphic'''.

Floating blocks are said to be ''floating'' because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page.  By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA2 ''New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX, Comprehensive'']. p. VS-B2.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, [[typesetting]] is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.

For example, an article on [[geography]] might have "Figure 1: Map of the world", "Figure 2: Map of Europe", "Table 1: Population of continents", "Table 2: Population of European countries", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures—in addition to the [[table of contents]]—that lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.

Other kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:

: Sidebar:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-I0_7Utu58C&amp;pg=PT406 ''Sams Teach Yourself Dreamweaver CS5 in 24 Hours'']. p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; For digressions from the main narrative. For example, a technical manual on usage of a product might include examples of how various people have employed the product in their work in sidebars. Also called an ''intermezzo''. See [[sidebar (publishing)]].
: Program: Articles and books on [[computer programming]] often place code and [[algorithms]] in a figure.
: Equation: Writing on [[mathematics]] may place large blocks of mathematical notation in numbered blocks set apart from the main text.

==Presenting layouts under development==

A [[mockup]] of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready.  Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch.  A [[comprehensive layout]] for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue.  A [[website wireframe]] is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.

[[Lorem ipsum]] text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published.  Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled "[[for position only]]".

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

===Awards===
Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

'''Peace education''' is the process of acquiring the ''values'', the ''knowledge'' and developing the ''attitudes, skills, and behaviors'' to live in harmony with oneself, with others, and with the natural environment.

There are numerous [[United Nations]] declarations on the importance of peace education.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Chapter 1. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]; and Page, James S.

[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12720/ Further information]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ban Ki Moon]], U.N. Secretary General, has dedicated the [[International Day of Peace]] 2013 to peace education in an effort to refocus minds and financing on the preeminence of peace education as the means to bring about a [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|culture of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/peaceday/2013/sgmessage_countdown.shtml Peace Day 2013 Countdown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples include:
* Constitution of [[UNESCO]], adopted 16 November 1945.
* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Section 26.
* Recommendation Concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Section 18.
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], Article 29.1(d).
* [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] – [[World Conference on Human Rights]], Part 2, Paragraphs 78–82, which identify peace education as part of [[human rights education]], and which identifies this education as vital for world peace
* Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, Articles 1 and 4.
* Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, Articles 1/4 and B/9.
* A World Fit for Children, Articles 5 and 20
* United Study on Disarmament and Non-proliferation Education, Article 20.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koichiro Matsuura]], the immediate past Director-General of [[UNESCO]], has written of peace education as being of "fundamental importance to the mission of UNESCO and the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;Matsuura, Koichiro. (2008) 'Foreword'. In: J.S.Page ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations.'' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Peace education as a right is something which is now increasingly emphasized by peace researchers such as [[Betty Reardon]]&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Betty. (1997). 'Human Rights as Education for Peace'. In: G.J. Andrepoulos and R.P. Claude (eds.) ''Human Rights Education for the Twenty-First Century.'' (255-261). Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Douglas Roche]].&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Douglas. (1993). ''The Human Right to Peace''. Toronto: Novalis.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a recent meshing of peace education and [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly. (1993) ''Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (World Conference on Human Rights).'' New York: United Nations. (A/CONF. 157/23 on June 25, 1993). Part 2, Paragraphs 78-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Ian Harris and John Synott have described peace education as a series of "teaching encounters" that draw from people:&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ian and Synott, John. (2002) 'Peace Education for a New Century' ''Social Alternatives'' 21(1):3-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*their desire for peace,
*nonviolent alternatives for managing conflict, and
*skills for critical analysis of structural arrangements that produce and legitimize [[social injustice|injustice]] and [[social inequality|inequality]].
[[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] suggests peace education be thought of as "encouraging a commitment to peace as a settled disposition and enhancing the confidence of the individual as an individual agent of peace; as informing the student on the consequences of war and social injustice; as informing the student on the value of peaceful and just social structures and working to uphold or develop such social structures; as encouraging the student to love the world and to imagine a peaceful future; and as caring for the student and encouraging the student to care for others".&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the theory or philosophy of peace education has been assumed and not articulated. [[Johan Galtung]] suggested in 1975 that no theory for peace education existed and that there was clearly an urgent need for [[peace and conflict studies|such theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan (1975) ''Essays in Peace Research, Volume 1''. Copenhagen: Eljers. pp. 334-339.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been attempts to establish such a theory. Joachim James Calleja has suggested  that a philosophical basis for peace education might be located in the [[categorical imperative|Kantian notion of duty]].&lt;ref&gt;Calleja, Joachim James (1991) 'A Kantian Epistemology of Education and Peace: An Examination of Concepts and Values'. Unpublishd PhD Thesis. Bradford University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] has suggested that a rationale for peace education might be located in virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, conservative [[political ethics]], aesthetic ethics and the ethics of care.&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) ''Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations''. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/ Chapter details]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early decades of the 20th century, "peace education" programs around the world have represented a spectrum of focal themes, including [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclearism]], international understanding, environmental responsibility, communication skills, [[nonviolence]], conflict resolution techniques, democracy, human rights awareness, tolerance of diversity, coexistence and [[gender equality]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;See Groff, L., and Smoker, P. (1996). Creating global-local cultures of peace. Peace and Conflict
Studies Journal, 3, (June); Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal
(Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-
Bass Publishers; Johnson, M.L. (1998). Trends in peace education. ERIC Digest. ED417123; Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. “Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being”. Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=January 2011}} have also addressed spiritual dimensions of inner harmony, or synthesized a number of the foregoing issues into programs on world citizenship. While academic discourse on the subject has increasingly recognized the need for a broader, more holistic approach to peace education, a review of field-based projects reveals that three variations of peace education are most common: conflict resolution training, democracy education, and [[human rights education]]. New approaches are emerging and calling into question some of theoretical foundations of the models just mentioned. The most significant of these new approaches focuses on peace education as a process of worldview transformation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Forms==

===Conflict resolution training===
Peace education programs centered on conflict resolution typically focus on the social-behavioural symptoms of conflict, training individuals to resolve inter-personal disputes through techniques of negotiation and (peer) mediation. Learning to manage anger, "fight fair" and improve communication through skills such as listening, turn-taking, identifying needs, and separating facts from emotions, constitute the main elements of these programs. Participants are also encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to brainstorm together on compromises&lt;ref&gt;See Deutsch, M. (1993). Educating for a peaceful world. American Psychologist, 48, 510-517; Hakvoort, I. and Oppenheimer, L. (1993). Children and adolescents' conceptions of peace, war, and strategies to attain peace: A Dutch case study. Journal of Peace Research, 30, 65-77; Harris, I.M. (1999). Types of peace education. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 299-317). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, approaches of this type aim to "alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S. (1999). Adolescents' beliefs about their conflict behaviour. In A. Raviv, L. Oppenheimer, and D. Bar-Tal (Eds.), How Children Understand War and Peace (pp. 208-230). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training ([[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]], [[Verbal Aikido]], [[Non-violent communication|NVC]]) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: "Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy education===
Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence
and war decreases. At the same time, "a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of [[critical thinking]], debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, [[toleration|tolerance]] of [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], compromise and [[conscientious objection]]. Their aim is to produce "responsible citizens" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students "assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others":&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; skills that a multi-party democracy are
based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace.

===Human rights education===
Peace education programs centered on raising [[awareness]] of [[human rights]] typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights education "faces continual elaboration, a significant theory-practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity".&lt;ref&gt;Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. "Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being". Paper
for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and
Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In one practitioner's view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can increase the potential for conflict"''&lt;ref&gt;Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, D. (2002). Human rights education in diverse, developing nations: A case in point – South Africa. Issues of Democracy, 7 (March). Retrieved January 12, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldview transformation===
Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78.

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes an "Integrative Theory of Peace" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community.

===Critical peace education===
Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj &amp; Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas &amp; Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty &amp; Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2004). "Comment: what is peace education?" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Ginty, R. &amp; Richmond, O. (2007). "Myth or Reality: Opposing Views on the Liberal Peace and Post-War Reconstruction,", Global Society 21: 491-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding, D. (2017). "Border Cosmopolitanism in Critical Peace Education,", Journal of Peace Education 14(2): 155-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2008). Encyclopedia of Peace Education. Charlotte: Information Age Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. (2015). 'Pedagogies of Resistance' and critical peace education praxis. Journal of Peace Education 12(2): 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bajaj, M. &amp; Hantzopooulos, M. (Eds) (2016). Introduction: Theory, Research, and Praxis of Peace Education in Peace Education: International Perspectives. New York: Bloomsbury (1-16).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trifonas, P. P. &amp; Wright, B. (2013). "Introduction," in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx).&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Yogic peace education===
Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish &amp; Joyce 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Standish, K. &amp; Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; in concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilised to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society.

== Criticism ==
Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education "inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice". "Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, G. (2002). "The Nature of Peace Education: Not All Programs Are Created Equal" in G. Salomon and B. Nevo (eds.) Peace education: The concept, principles and practices in the world. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Quoted in Nelson, Linden L. (2000). "Peace Education from a Psychological Perspective: Contributions of the Peace and Education Working Group of the American Psychological Association Div. 48."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salomon (2002) raises the problem and its consequences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Imagine that medical practitioners would not distinguish between invasive surgery to remove malignant tumors and surgery to correct one's vision. Imagine also that while surgeries are practiced, no research and no evaluation of their differential effectiveness accompany them. The field would be considered neither very serious nor very trustworthy. Luckily enough, such a
state of affairs does not describe the field of medicine, but it comes pretty close to describing the field of peace education. First, too many profoundly different kinds of activities taking place in an exceedingly wide array of contexts are all lumped under the same category label of "peace education" as if they belong together. Second, for whatever reason, the field's scholarship in the form of theorizing, research and program evaluation badly lags behind practice… In the absence of clarity of what peace education really is, or how its different varieties relate to each other, it is unclear how experience with one variant of peace education in one region can usefully inform programs in another region."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Clarke-Habibi (2005), "A general or integrated theory of peace is needed: one that can holistically account for the intrapersonal, inter-personal, inter-group and international dynamics of peace, as well as its main principles and pre-requisites. An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke-Habibi, Sara. (2005) "Transforming Worldviews: The Case of Education for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina". Journal of Transformative Education, Vol. 3 No. 1, pp. 33-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Round About a Pound a Week''''' was an influential&lt;ref name=Oren&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oren|first=Laura |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Winter–Spring 1973 |title=The Welfare of Women in Laboring Families:England, 1860-1950 |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |pages=107 |id= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1913 survey of poverty and [[infant mortality]] in London, by feminist and socialist [[Maud Pember Reeves]], co-authored by anarchist activist [[Charlotte Wilson]].  The project was conceived and carried out under the auspices of the [[Fabian Society]]'s Women's Group, which she co-founded in 1908. The report was originally published as a political pamphlet or tract, arguing for specific reforms, but is still in print and considered relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzine.co.nz/views/maud_reeves.html nzine review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/30/round-about-pound-maud-pember-reeves] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review of 2008 reissue&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
[[Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09|A Royal Commission]] was gathering evidence on the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]]; [[Beatrice Webb]] was a commissioner, and contributed to [[Minority report (Poor Law)|the Minority Report]], but she could see that most of the commission had a [[Majority report (Poor Law)|different vision to implement]].  Webb was also a member of the Fabian Society, a precursor to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as was Pember Reeves. They wanted to understand and alleviate poverty, so they focussed their attention on a few dozen families in [[Lambeth]], a poor borough in [[South London]] and still one of the poorest parts of Britain,&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; and recorded their attempt at [[social reform]] over the four years just before the [[Great War]], i.e. 1909–1913. The families they selected were ''not'' the poorest; they were the "respectable poor" of the working class, with the menfolk in relatively stable employment, earning "about a [[pound (sterling)|pound]] a week"; nonetheless, one in five of the [[infant mortality|children died at birth]], and another one in ten before they reached adulthood. The project targeted pregnant women, and offered them money for extra food from a few months before the birth until several months afterwards. The families kept detailed budgets of their income and expenditure. 

The book contains details of the division of food within the family, with the breadwinner being given a much greater share of the food than the rest of the family. This was because the other family members were completely dependent on the breadwinner. Nonetheless, this was rarely a sufficient amount.&lt;ref name=Oren /&gt; The conditions in the book have been described as "appalling",&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;Rose, Sonya O, 1993, "Limited Livelihoods. Gender and Class in nineteenth-Century England". University of California Press. p.79&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the daily struggle these women faced to feed their families without being "forced to pawn their own boots".&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;

It has also been noted that Reeves avoided the "sense of moral superiority" common in outside observers of these people, seeing them as "independent, resourceful, hard-working, respectable, but poor".&lt;ref name=Perkin&gt;Perkin, Joan, 1989. "Women and Marriage in nineteenth-Century England". Routledge, London. p 131&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Fabian pamphlet argued for government reforms, including [[child benefit]], [[school dinner]]s, and free [[primary health care|health clinics]]. It also noted the role of poor housing conditions in child mortality, and how prenatal nutrition could help.

'''High salt marsh dieback''', or salt marsh browning, is the primary force in [[salt marsh]] degradation in the high marsh. The general effect is that the plants in the marsh die off and brown, leaving dead [[organic matter]], and ultimately open [[sediment]].  Without strong plant roots holding the sediment, these open areas of land [[erosion|erode]], causing the salt marsh to retreat back to the mainland.&lt;ref name=Webetal&gt;Webb E.C., Mendelssohn I.A., Wilsey B.J. (1995) "Causes for vegetation dieback in a Louisiana salt marsh: a bioassay approach". ''[[Aquatic Botany]]'' 51: 281–289&lt;/ref&gt; Dieback zones lack their main producers, such as the salt marsh cord grass, or ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'', and ultimately become completely unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Bertness M, Silliman B.R., Jefferies R. (2004) "Salt marshes under siege". ''American Scientist'' 92(1): 54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of hypotheses ==

Scientists have studied salt marsh dieback for decades, and they still argue about its causes.  One of the main ideas suggests that salt marsh dieback is caused by [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] in ''S. alterniflora'' from increased submersion within the tides, increased sediment, and [[oxygen]] deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman P.J, Williams W.T. (1961) "Investigations into 'die-back' in ''Spartina townsendii'' agg." ''Journal of Ecology'' 49(2): 391–398&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have researched the possibility of increased [[soil salinity]] and decreased soil water as the causes for dieback.&lt;ref&gt;Brown C.E., Pezeshki S.R. (2007) "Threshold for recovery in the marsh halophyte ''Spartina alterniflora'' grown under the combined effects of salinity and soil drying". ''Journal of Plant Physiology'' 164: 274–282&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of salt marshes ===

Salt marshes are important in preserving the brooding and nursery habitats of shellfish, fish, and insects.

== Waterlogging hypothesis ==

Waterlogging is the result of too much water in a plant's [[root]] system and the surrounding soil, and usually occurs in the inland areas of the marsh.  With the increase of surface water, waterlogged soils contain many reduced molecules, which can induce the accumulation of sulfide and other toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L. (1988) "''Spartina alterniflora'' die-back in Louisiana: Time-course investigation of soil waterlogging effects". ''Journal of Ecology'' 76: 509–521&lt;/ref&gt; Current studies suggest that increased waterlogging is caused by [[sea level rise]], a possible effect of [[global warming]], which has many natural and anthropologic causes of its own.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., Kuhn N.L. (2003) "Sediment subsidy: effects on soil-plant responses in a rapidly submerging coastal salt marsh". ''Ecological Engineering'' 21: 115–128&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduced aerobic respiration ===

Salt marsh dieback results in the death of marsh-specific plants and the erosion of the landscape. One of the causes of waterlogging is the reduced [[cellular respiration|aerobic respiration]] by the roots of ''S. alterniflora''.  It occurs  mainly in the  inland zones, though the streamside plants show partial anaerobic respiration.

Aerobic respiration takes sugars and oxygen to create carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

As aerobic respiration decreases, the plants become oxygen deficient, since the roots are unable to produce enough oxygen in the reduced soil conditions.  Decreased oxygen uptake can also decrease plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L., Patrick, W.H. (1981) "Oxygen deficiency in ''Spartina alterniflora'' roots: Metabolic adaptation to anoxia". ''Science'' 214: 439–441&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain energy, these plants then go through a process of alcoholic [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] (Mendelssohn et al. 1981).  This fermentation process has an end product of carbon in the form of ethanol, which is diffused from the roots.  Therefore, the plants are unable to use the diffused carbon, so the available plant energy decreases.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee/&gt;

=== Increased soil sulfide ===

Another product of waterlogging is the increase of [[sulfide]] in soil.  The increase of sulfide is caused by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and aerobic bacteria, which are mainly seen in reduced soils.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn/&gt;

Increased sulfide has been shown to inhibit NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N (ammoniacal nitrogen, an ammonium salt) uptake within the plant.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnMcKee/&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N is the most available form of [[nitrogen]] within the soil and it is a limiting nutrient in ''S. alterniflora'' productivity.

A higher concentration of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N in the soil may show that the plant's uptake of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N has decreased, leaving excess molecules in the soil.  In addition, reduced soils can cause plant nitrification to decrease, leading to a greater lack of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N uptake.&lt;ref name=Webetal/&gt;

=== Possible solutions ===

Some scientists have found solutions to this problem.  Mendelssohn and Kuhn set up an experiment with plants and soils in a Louisiana salt marsh in 2003.  They found that when sediment deposits are increased within an unhealthy salt marsh area, the plants and soils are in better conditions. 

The experiment showed that the plants with the greater sediment levels had more plant cover, with higher plants and a greater bulk density.  The surface elevation increased with the increase of sediment, therefore reducing flooding.  The roots could respire aerobically, so they did not have to rely on fermentation for energy.  The plants with more sediment also showed a decrease in sulfide and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N concentrations in the soil.  Mendelssohn postulates that since the concentration of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N decreased after the addition of sediment, more of the nitrogen was used by the plants.&lt;ref name=MendelssohnKuhn/&gt;

== Salinity hypothesis ==

A second hypothesis of salt marsh dieback focuses on increased salinity and lack of soil water being the main causes of salt marsh dieback.  Some scientists see this hypothesis as relevant, since global warming suggests that increased global temperatures may lead to increased [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]].

Brown and Pezeshki devised an experiment in which many ''S. alterniflora'' individuals were put under situations of increased salinity, increased water stress, and then a combined treatment.  They found that those plants that experienced the combined treatment exhibited an increase in water stress, where plants are unable to get a sufficient amount of water from the soil, a decrease in photosynthetic activity, and ultimately death (Brown &amp; Pezeshki 2007).

A '''social edition''' is a form of textual scholarship that utilizes social media like Wikimedia or blogs to create annotated editions of texts. [[Constance Crompton|Crompton]], [[Alyssa Arbuckle|Arbuckle]] and [[Ray Siemens|Siemens]] describe that "Using social media allows us to integrate a new stage into the editorial process — a stage that fills the gap between an edition’s initial planning stages and its concluding blind peer review, which capitalizes on the engaged knowledge communities inside and outside the academy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-online.ca/index.php/src/article/viewFile/118/268 "Understanding the Social Edition Through Iterative Implementation: The Case of the Devonshire MS (BL Add MS 17492),"] with Constance Crompton, Alyssa Arbuckle, and the Devonshire MS Editorial Group. ''Scholarly and Research Communication'' 4.2 (2013). 9 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Sulfur water''' (or '''sulphur water''') is a condition where the running water contains a high amount of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas that escapes into the air when the plumbing line is opened, giving a distinct "rotten egg" smell.  

==Cause and treatment==
The condition indicates a high level of [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] in the water supply. This may be due to the use of well water, poorly treated city water, or water heater contamination.

Various methods exist to treat sulfur in water. These methods include
# Use of a [[Carbon_filtering|Carbon Filter]] (useful for very small amounts of hydrogen sulfide)
# Filtering the water through a canister of manganese oxide coated [[Greensand]]
# [[Water_aeration|Aeration]] of the water
# Treating the water with [[Water_chlorination|chlorine]] (can be used to treat large amounts of hydrogen sulfide)

==Health==
Bathing in water high in sulfur or other minerals for its presumed health benefits is known as [[balneotherapy]].

===Concerns===
According to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking water with high levels of sulfate can cause diarrhea, especially in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cervin|first1=Michael|title=Sulfur Springs: To Soak or not to Soak?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/08/sulfur-springs-to-soak-or-not-to-soak/|accessdate=24 February 2015|agency=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ethos Effect''''' (2003) is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]], a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Parafaith War]]''. It is set in a future where humanity has spread to the stars and divided into several factions. Many factions including the [[Eco-Tech Coalition]], the [[Revenants of the Prophet]] ("revs") and the Taran Empire are engaged in escalating conflict over territory and their competing social philosophies. Against this background, former Taran Empire officer Van C. Albert is recruited by the mysterious [[Trystin Desoll]] to work for the equally mysterious [[Integrated Information Systems]].

While this novel shares many themes that can be found in other novels by Modesitt, ''Ethos'' adds elements of Societal Ethics rather than only involving personal ethics.  This is one of the only books written by Modesitt where a person enacts major political and structural changes in the culture into which the protagonist was raised.

==Literary significance and reception==
Jackie Cassada in her review for ''[[The Library Journal]]'' called this novel a "fast-paced yet complexly plotted work of military sf portrays three-dimensional characters caught up in internal and external battles as they search for ways to combine personal integrity with their professional duties. A thoughtfully written, hard-hitting tale that belongs in most collections."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie|date=September 15, 2003|title=The Ethos Effect (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 15|pages=95|issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Cannon in his review for [[Publishers Weekly]] said that "despite some expository lumps and wooden characterization, thoughtful SF readers will appreciate this weighty tale of humanitarian intentions and social speculations."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=October 6, 2003|title=The Ethos Effect (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 40|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frieda Murray reviewing for [[Booklist]] said "Modesitt knows well how to
keep this kind of soup at a boil."&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Frieda|date=September 15, 2003|title=The Ethos Effect (Book)|journal=Booklist|volume= 100|issue= 2|pages=218|issn=0006-7385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blavatsky.003.jpg|thumb|180px|&lt;center&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky]] ([[Theosophist]]).&lt;/center&gt;]]
Modern [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is classified by prominent representatives of [[Western philosophy]] as a "[[pantheistic]]{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=294}} [[Religious syncretism|philosophical-religious system]]."{{sfn|Britannica}}{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=302}}{{sfn|Крашкина|1999}}{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=11}} A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Trefilov]] claimed that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] doctrine was formed from the beginning as a synthesis of philosophical views and [[Religion|religious]] forms of the various ages and peoples with modern scientific ideas.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} An author of [[The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] Michael Wakoff stated that Blavatskian Theosophy was based on [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], and fragments of the [[Western esotericism]] with using an "absolutist [[metaphysics]]."{{sfn|Wakoff|2016}} In ''[[:ru:Новая философская энциклопедия|The New Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' it is said Blavatsky's Theosophy is an attempt to merge into a universal doctrine all religions by revealing their "common deep essence" and detection of "identity meanings of symbols," all philosophies (including [[esoteric]]), and all [[science]]s (including [[occult]]).{{sfn|Митюгова|2010}}{{refn|group=note|Professor James McClenon wrote that philosophy "used as one source of inspiration" by Blavatsky.{{sfn|McClenon|1998}} In professor Julia Shabanova's opinion, philosophy as the "sphere of spiritual culture" is the closest one to Theosophy.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=22}}}}

== Philosophers about Theosophy ==
=== One point of view ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] wrote that "the theories of the [[Theosophical Society]] are so strangely similar to those of [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] that one may wonder whether they do not both derive from a common source."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|He referred here a magazine author Georges Pécoul.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=29}} According to Julia Shabanova, the Theosophical [[epistemology]] is based on [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]] and principle of analogies.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=93}}}} He stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Concerning of the "so-called highly secret Tibetan texts" used by Blavatsky in writing her books ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and ''[[The Voice of the Silence]],'' Guénon stated that she has had a "translation of extracts from the [[Kangyur|Kandjur]] and [[Tengyur|Tandjur]]," published in 1836 by [[Alexander Csoma de Koros]].{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=85–6}}{{refn|group=note|It is needed to note Guénon was a hard opponent of the Theosophists, for example, he wrote, "The best way to fight Theosophy is, in our opinion, to display its history for what it is."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=291}}}}

=== Other point of view ===
An Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} wrote that, in modern interpretations of the Theosophical doctrine, one can come across the concept of "philosophy of Theosophy." In accordance with this logic, Theosophy should contain, in addition to philosophy, other aspects and manifestations. The specificity of Theosophy is "integrality of the theoretical &amp; practical [approach], metaphysical &amp; existential [points of view], [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] &amp; [[immanence]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] &amp; [[particular]], [[epistemology]] &amp; [[ontology]]." The Theosophical object of knowledge, as well as philosophical one, is "universal, essential, ultimate" one. But, according to Shabanova, [Western] philosophy, striving for the essential, although it allows in its space [[irrationality]], [[mysticism]], or intuitionism, rationally explains the features of the world picture.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=22}}

In Shabanova's opinion, the term "Theosophy" is often applied to the Theosophical teachings, which can be considered the "body of Theosophy." It is necessary, she wrote, to distinguish, first, the transcendental basis of Theosophy as its "universal core," secondly, Theosophy as a "state of consciousness," and thirdly, Theosophy as a systematically formulated teaching. If "Divine wisdom" is the absolute Truth, then "''the Theosophical doctrine''" reflects the facets of this Truth, represented through "enlightened consciousness" and framed in certain knowledge and representations. Thus, the Theosophical teaching is not Truth, but only a "description" of it. To be proficient in the Theosophical knowledge does not yet mean reaching the "Theosophical state of consciousness," because the accumulation of knowledge is not sufficient for the attainment of "Wisdom." She claimed that the Theosophical teaching gets meaning through the [[self-realization]] of man, which is a "way of awakening the Divine wisdom."{{refn|group=note|Professor [[I. K. Taimni|Iqbal Taimni]] stated, "Hindu religious teachers called [[Rishi]]s were philosophers, and the great philosophers were generally [[Yogi]]s."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=xxvii}}}} Shabanova noted a "synthetic character" of the Theosophical teachings, which conditioned by the syncretic nature of the "transcendental nucleus" of Theosophy. For this reason, Theosophy can not be expressed in the form of an "ultimate doctrine," and its various interpretations lead to contradictions both within the Theosophical Society and in external assessments.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|pp=19–21}}

Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy is quoted in a book by Shabanova:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Theosophy is... the archaic ''Wisdom-Religion,'' the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization. This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian [[Budha]], the Babylonian [[Nabu|Nebo]], the [[Thoth]] of Memphis, the [[Hermes]] of Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses—[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Neith]]a, [[Athena]], the [[Gnostic]] ''[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]],'' and finally the [[Vedas]], from the word 'to know.' Under this designation, all the ancient philosophers of the East and West, the [[Hierophant]]s of old Egypt, the [[Rishi]]s of [[Aryavarta]], the [[Theodidaktos|Theodidaktoi]] of Greece, included all knowledge of things occult and essentially divine."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967|1p=89|Шабанова|2016|2p=24}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that, according to the explanation of Blavatsky, her Theosophy "is not a religion, but it is divine knowledge or science," and the very term applies not to God, but to the gods or to any divine being, and it is not God's wisdom, but the divine wisdom, i. e. that belongs to the gods at all.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911a|p=287}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shabanova wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself—the very essence of philosophical and theistic enquiry." And the genuine Theosophists should have faith in the intangible, omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible Cause, which "is '''All''', and '''Nothing'''; ubiquitous yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1pp=5–6|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}

In 1879, the originator of modern Theosophy first presented the statement on "a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and ''Unknowable''" which was the "central idea of the [[Eclecticism|Eclectic]] Theosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967|1p=90|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}} This statement was later developed by Blavatsky in the proem to ''The Secret Doctrine'' where it is said that there is "an Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable '''Principle''' on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888|1p=14|Percival|1905|2p=205|Santucci|2012|3p=234|Шабанова|2016|4p=91}}{{refn|group=note|As professor Taimni said, "Wisdom can come only from true religion and philosophy."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=xxiv}}}}

== Blavatsky about philosophy ==
=== "Philosophers and Philosophicules" ===
A religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in Blavatsky's article "Philosophers and Philosophicules"{{sfn|Blavatsky|1973}} it is about "the issues of philosophy from the Theosophical perspective."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=147}}{{refn|group=note|This article was first published in 1889 in the Theosophical magazine ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]].'' Later it was included in the 11th volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1973}}}} The article author believes that Theosophy deserves respect as a serious intellectual activity, basing on publicly voiced philosophical principles.{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] claimed, "Philosophy, not less than religion, bears the stamp of theosophical ideology."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=6}}}} According to Kalnitsky, to avoid confusion, she says Theosophy cannot be reduced to a single form of knowledge or intellectual activity, "Theosophy is certainly not a philosophy, simply because it includes every philosophy as every science and religion."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=434|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=148}}

Kalnitsky wrote that the article author fully convinced that Theosophy should be "life blood" of philosophy, which is defined as "the science of things divine and human, and the causes in which they are contained." Also she believes that only Theosophy has the "keys" to these causes.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=149}} Blavatsky claims that philosophy was "crystallization point" of various forms of knowledge, and he quoted in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When applied to [[god]] or gods, it became in every country [[theology]]; when to material nature, it was called [[physics]] and natural history; concerned with man, it appeared as [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]; and when raised to the higher regions it becomes known as [[metaphysics]]. Such is philosophy—'the science of effects by their causes'—the very spirit of the doctrine of [[Karma]], the most important teaching under various names of every religious philosophy, and a theosophical tenet that belongs to no one religion but explains them all. Philosophy is also called 'the science of things possible, inasmuch as they are possible'."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=434|Kalnitsky|2003|2pр=149–50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theosophy and Hegelianism ===
In Kalnitsky's opinion, in hers article Blavatsky trying apparently to get a "legitimation" her Theosophical ideas, arguing that they are not at variance with the views of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] on the essence of philosophy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hegel regards it as 'the contemplation of the self-development of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|'''Absolute''']]', or in other words as 'the representation of the Idea' ({{lang-de|Darstellung der Idee}}). The whole of the [[Esoteric|Secret]] [[Philosophy|Doctrine]]—of which the work bearing that name is but an atom—is such a contemplation and record, as far as finite language and limited thought can record the processes of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Infinite]]."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=435|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=151}}{{refn|group=note|A Russian philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that for the Theosophical [[gnosticism]], just like for [[Hegelianism]], God and the world are "in principle cognizable."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Vladimir Solovyov, philosophy, as a revelation of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] in its absolute form, was adopted by Hegel not as a collection of various systems but as the gradual implementation of a true single system.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1914|p=317}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, according to Blavatsky, the Theosophical Secret Doctrine is the most complete and "mature" expression "of philosophical activity", which is carried out as "such a contemplation and record" of the Absolute.{{refn|group=note|"The Absolute is the Ultimate Reality or [[Parabrahman]] of Hindu philosophy."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=67}}}} Kalnitsky wrote that, turning to the Hegelian theory and trying to find herein "substantial doctrinal parallels," she aims to consolidate her philosophical authority. Hegel's system, like most other idealist trends in philosophy, gave many useful concepts Theosophists, but in most cases, the Theosophical views differed with them due to a number of distinctions in basic positions.{{refn|group=note|Abbott Clark wrote that Blavatskian Theosophy, "considered as a philosophy, is an [[objective idealism]], because it postulates the Cosmos as the product of Cosmic Ideation and the imbodiment of consciousness."{{sfn|Clark|1942}} However, professor [[Robert Ellwood]] claimed that Theosophy "is not some form of [[metaphysical idealism]] or mentalism which says that consciousness is ''prior'' to matter." He wrote, "What is prior is not consciousness as we know it but the Unknown Root from which both consciousness and matter stem."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=28}}}} In terms of Theosophists, philosophical activity was considered barren without occult and [[Mysticism|mystical]] assumptions, and intelligent searches have been justified only if they have provided evidence of their beliefs.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=151–2}}

Kalnitsky wrote that, defining "Theosophical speculation" as an act of true philosophy, Blavatsky states that the commonality of purposes eliminates traditional religious restrictions, "Thus it becomes evident that Theosophy cannot be a 'religion', still less 'a sect', but it is indeed the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=435|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=152}} In his opinion, Blavatsky's statement that Theosophy is the "synthesis" and something "big" compared to any discipline or type of knowledge is inevitably present certain amount of linguistic confusion and contradictions. She claims that her Theosophy should be regarded as "the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects" and that it "cannot be a religion." Trying to preserve the religious, philosophical and scientific tradition, she insists on prevailing over all synthetic and inclusive status of Theosophy, using a rhetorical technique, when '''a''' seems minor compared to '''the'''. Thus, Theosophy is not simply '''a''' religion, philosophy or science, but '''the''' more authoritative and reliable source that covers and synthesizes them. In this case, Theosophy seems "'''the''' quintessence of the highest philosophy." He wrote that it should be noted "continual irritation" of the article author against any attempt to interpret Theosophy as a privileged religion or sect, which is for her a challenge, requiring immediate transition to protection by the proclamation that Theosophy avoids dogmatism and aims to be inclusive.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=152}}

According to Kalnitsky, Blavatsky was sure that she was able to prove Theosophy can match with any definition of philosophy, and there is a general philosophical principles which the Theosophy does not contradict. She quotes [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], who said that philosophy is "a search for principles, sensible and abstract truths," as well as the use of reason "to its legitimate objects." She believes that Theosophy is completely legitimate and reliable means of achieving these goals, especially relating to the nature of "the [[Soul|Ego]], or mental Self" and the relationship between "the ideal and the real." That is why in theory she perceive Theosophy, albeit with some limitations, as the equivalent of philosophy. Blavatsky believes that "he who studies Theosophy, studies the highest [[transcendental philosophy]]." In Kalnitsky's opinion, linking the Theosophical system with the tradition of philosophical reasoning, and assuming similar purposes, she trying to achieve for herself greater respectability and authority.{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=436|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=153}}

=== Versus unspiritual philosophism ===
At the end of hers article Blavatsky resorts to accusatory rhetoric, trying once again to show that Theosophy often is beyond the horizon of the people who might recognize it. Kalnitsky noted, "She compares her situation to that of [[Socrates]]," claiming that if his teachings was would rejected because of the charges against him, then knowledge, which was transmitted through [[Plato]] and philosophers-[[Neoplatonism|neoplatonists]] would never came up to us. Blavatsky, again turning her attention to modern philosophical mood, contemptuously speaks of those, who engage in unspiritual philosophizing. Speaking about the "true philosophers," she makes the following observation, and Kalnitsky quoted it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A [[Skepticism|sceptic]] can never aspire to that title. He who is capable of imagining the universe with its handmaiden Nature fortuitous, and hatched like the [[Black Pullet|black hen]] of the fable, out of a self-created egg hanging in space, has neither the power of thinking nor the spiritual faculty of perceiving abstract truths; which power and faculty are the first requisites of a philosophical mind. We see the entire realm of modern Science honeycombed with such [[Materialism|materialists]], who yet claim to be regarded as philosophers. They either believe in naught as do the [[Secularism|Secularists]], or doubt according to the manner of the [[Agnosticism|Agnostics]]."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1pp=438–9|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=153–4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Blavatsky believed that a priori assumption about the spiritual basis of reality determines the truth of any philosophy.{{refn|group=note|According to Indian philosophy's teachings, the world "open to the senses is not the whole world of nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2010|loc=Chap. 5/16}} Ellwood stated that, according to Theosophy: "Our ultimate environment is infinite Reality itself. It is also our closest environment, for it is manifested in everything, including ourselves."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=8}}}} Kalnitsky wrote that in the final part of hers article she "exalts" [[deductive reasoning]] of Plato,{{refn|group=note|Alvin Kuhn noted, "It is significant that Madame Blavatsky's occult philosophy aims to restore to scientific method the deductive procedure."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=264}}}} comparing it with [[inductive reasoning]] of modern thinkers: "None of our present [[Darwinism|Darwinians]], and materialists and their admirers, our critics, could have studied philosophy otherwise than very 'superficially'. Hence while Theosophists have a legitimate right to the title of ''philosophers''—true 'lovers of Wisdom'—their critics and slanderers are at best '''Philosophicules'''—the progeny of modern '''Philosophism'''."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=439|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=154}}{{refn|group=note|According to Clark, Blavatsky has humorously called the modern inductive philosophers, "philosophicules."{{sfn|Clark|1942}}}}

== Philosophers' criticism ==
;René Guénon
He called Blavatskian Theosophy a "theosophism" ({{lang-fr|théosophisme}}) and described it in his book as a "pseudo-religion." He wrote that presented by the Theosophical Society's leaders assertion about the alleged the "Eastern origin" of their doctrine was false, and its initial tendency was overtly anti-Christian. According to him, between the doctrine of the Theosophical Society, or, at least, that ones was proclaimed and Theosophy in the true sense of the word, there is absolutely no affinity:{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=3}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is after all only a confused mixture of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, [[Jewish Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], and [[occultism]], the whole of it being gathered as well as can be expressed around two or three ideas which, whether one likes it or not, are of completely modern and purely Western origin."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=91–2}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his opinion, the Theosophical conceptions of evolution "are basically only an absurd caricature of the Hindu theory of cosmic cycles."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=100}} He wrote that Theosophy "must be placed quite simply, along with [[spiritism]] and the different occultist schools to which it is obviously related, in the collection of bizarre productions of the contemporary mentality to which may be given the general name of '[[René Guénon#Contemporary "neo-spiritualism"|neo-spiritualism]].'"{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=108}}

;Vladimir Solovyov, and other 
A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that the main theories and doctrines of the Theosophical Society "seem to us very shaky and vague."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911a|p=291}} Blavatsky created, he explained, a "pseudo-Theosophical" Society, because hers teaching "is untenable and false." Thus, modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious" and "anti-scientific," but also "antiphilosophic."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911b|pp=395– 8}}

A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}} In [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]'s opinion, "contemporary 'theosophical' movements" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and "have made us forget" the existence of a genuine "Christian theosophy". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|pp=270, 299}} Also besides he stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is difficult to find creative thinkers among the Theosophists. The median level of the Theosophical books is not very high. Theosophists fight independent thoughts and are little interested by the multiplicity of creative processes, that occur outside their circle. The seclusive closed-in circle is very characteristic for the Theosophical... setting."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A Russian philosopher [[:ru:Лесевич, Владимир Викторович|Vladimir Lesevich]], firmly believing philosophical ignorance of Blavatsky, tartly noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What kind of audience they [the Theosophists] will snared, you can see from the witty expose the charlatanical tricks of Mme Blavatsky, who began a discuss the philosophy of Plato and talked a lot of all kinds of nonsense. Exposing all this nonsense shows full justice to the characteristics of the logical methods unscrupulous author of ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', who, appears, imagines itself that if she said anything a three-fold, the sentence has to be considered proven."{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An employee of the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy]] Lydia Fesenkova also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis, "From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2004|p=93}}

The '''Violins of Hope''' collection is a collection of [[Holocaust]] related [[string instruments]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. The instruments serve to educate and memorialize the lives of prisoners in [[concentration camps]] through concerts, exhibitions and other projects. The collection is owned by father and son team [[Amnon Weinstein|Amnon]] and Avshalom Weinstein, who are both [[luthiers|violin makers]].

==Concerts and exhibitions==
In the first decade of the new millennium, Weinstein started to use the instruments of the Violins of Hope collection to initiate concerts combined with educational events teaching about the Holocaust.

'''Visual art of the United States''' or '''American art''' is [[visual art]] made in the United States or by U.S. artists. Before colonization there were many flourishing traditions of [[Native American art]], and where the Spanish colonized [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] and the accompanying styles in other media were quickly in place. Early colonial art on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] initially relied on artists from Europe, with [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] (1540-c. 1593) the earliest example.  In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, artists primarily painted portraits, and some landscapes in a style based mainly on [[Art of the United Kingdom|English painting]].  Furniture-makers imitating English styles and similar craftsmen were also established in the major cities, but in the English colonies, locally made pottery remained [[American Stoneware|resolutely utilitarian]] until the 19th century, with fancy products imported.

But in the later 18th century two U.S. artists, [[Benjamin West]] and [[John Singleton Copley]], became the most successful painters in London of [[history painting]], then regarded as the highest form of art, giving the first sign of an emerging force in [[Western art]].  American artists who remained at home became increasingly skilled, although there was little awareness of them in Europe.  In the early 19th century the infrastructure to train artists began to be established, and from 1820 the [[Hudson River School]] began to produce [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[landscape painting]] that was original and matched the huge scale of U.S. landscapes.  The [[American Revolution]] produced a demand for patriotic art, especially history painting, while other artists recorded the frontier country.  A parallel development taking shape in rural U.S. was the [[American craft]] movement, which began as a reaction to the [[industrial revolution]].

After 1850 [[Academic art]] in the European style flourished, and as richer Americans became very wealthy, the flow of European art, new and old, to the US began; this has continued ever since.  Museums began to be opened to display much of this. Developments in modern art in Europe came to the U.S. from exhibitions in New York City such as the [[Armory Show]] in 1913. After World War II, New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world. Since then many U.S. movements have shaped [[Modern art|Modern]] and [[Postmodern art]]. Art in the United States today covers a huge range of styles.

==Beginnings==

{{See also|Painting in the Americas before European colonization}}
One of the first painters to visit British America was [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] (c. 1540 – c. 1606), who made important [[watercolor]] records of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life on the Eastern seaboard (now [[British Museum]]).  White first visited America as the artist and map-maker for an expedition of exploration, and in the early years of the Colonial period most other artists trained in Western styles were officers in the army and navy, whose training included sketching landscapes.  Eventually the English settlements grew large enough to support professional artists, mostly portrait-painters, often largely self-taught.  Among the earliest was [[John Smybert]] (1688–1751), a trained artist from London who emigrated in 1728 intending to be a professor of fine art, but instead became a portrait painter and printseller in Boston.  His friend [[Peter Pelham]] was a painter and printmaker.  Both needed other sources of income and had shops.  Meanwhile, the Spanish territories later to be American could see mostly religious art in the late [[Baroque]] style, mostly by native artists, and [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures continued to produce art in their various traditions.

==Eighteenth century==

After the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, which marked the official beginning of the American national identity, the new nation needed a history, and part of that history would be expressed visually. Most of early American art (from the late 18th century through the early 19th century) consists of [[history painting]] and especially [[Portrait painting|portraits]]. As in Colonial America, many of the painters who specialized in portraits were essentially self-taught; notable among them are [[Joseph Badger]], [[John Brewster, Jr.]], and [[William Jennys]]. The young nation's artists generally emulated the style of British art, which they knew through [[Old master prints|print]]s and the paintings of English-trained immigrants such as John Smibert (1688–1751) and [[John Wollaston (painter)|John Wollaston]] (active 1742–75).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1981 National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512111352/http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1981 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Feke]] (1707–52), an untrained painter of the colonial period, achieved a sophisticated style based on Smibert's example.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, James Thomas. ''John Singleton Copley''. Fordham University Press. 1948. p. 20. {{ISBN|0823215237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Willson Peale]], who gained much of his earliest art training by studying Smibert's copies of European paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Booker Wright, Louis, ''The Arts in America: the colonial period''. Schocken. 1975. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; painted portraits of many of the important figures of the [[American Revolution]]. Peale's younger brother [[James Peale]] and four of Peale's sons—[[Raphaelle Peale]], [[Rembrandt Peale]], [[Rubens Peale]] and [[Titian Peale]]—were also artists. Painters such as [[Gilbert Stuart]] made portraits of the newly elected government officials,&lt;ref name=gsm&gt;[http://www.gilbertstuartmuseum.com/ Gilbert Stuart Birthplace and Museum]. ''Gilbert Stuart Biography''. Accessed July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which became iconic after being reproduced on various U.S. Postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027665 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Singleton Copley]] painted [[emblem]]atic [[Portrait painting|portraits]] for the increasingly prosperous merchant class, including a portrait of ''[[Paul Revere]]'' (ca. 1768–70). The original version of his most famous painting, ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778), is in the collection of [[The National Gallery of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/watson/watsonhome.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art |access-date=2012-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232844/http://www.nga.gov/feature/watson/watsonhome.shtm |archive-date=2012-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while there is another version in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] and a third version in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. [[Benjamin West]] painted portraits as well as history paintings of the [[French and Indian War]]. West also worked in London where many American artists studied under him, including [[Washington Allston]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bwst/hd_bwst.htm Barratt, Carrie Rebora.

When [[Landscape art|landscape]] was painted it was most often done to show how much property a subject owned, or as a picturesque background for a portrait.

The first well-known U.S. school of painting—the [[Hudson River School]]—appeared in 1820. [[Thomas Cole]] pioneered the movement which included [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Thomas Doughty (artist)|Thomas Doughty]] and several others. As with music and literature, this development was delayed until artists perceived that the New World offered subjects unique to itself; in this case the westward expansion of settlement brought the transcendent beauty of frontier landscapes to painters' attention.

The Hudson River painters' directness and simplicity of vision influenced and inspired such later artists as [[John Kensett]] and the ''[[Luminism (American art style)|Luminists]]''; as well as [[George Inness]] and the ''[[Tonalism|tonalists]]'' (which included [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] among others), and [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), who depicted the rural U.S.—the sea, the mountains, and the people who lived near them.

The Hudson River School landscape painter [[Robert S. Duncanson]] was one of the first important [[African American art|African American painters]]. [[John James Audubon]], an [[ornothology|ornothologist]] whose paintings documented birds, was one of the most important naturalist artists in the early U.S. His major work, a set of colored prints entitled ''[[The Birds of America]]'' (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. [[Edward Hicks]] was a U.S. [[Folk art|folk painter]] and distinguished [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] of the [[Society of Friends]]. He became a Quaker [[Cultural icon|icon]] because of his paintings.

Paintings of the Great West, many of which emphasized the sheer size of the land and the cultures of the native people living on it, became a distinct genre as well. [[George Catlin]] depicted the West and its people as honestly as possible. [[George Caleb Bingham]], and later [[Frederick Remington]], [[Charles M. Russell]], the photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]], and others recorded the U.S. Western heritage and the [[Old American West]] through their art.

[[History painting]] was a less popular genre in U.S. art during the 19th century, although ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', painted by the German-born [[Emanuel Leutze]], is among the best-known U.S. paintings. The historical and military paintings of [[William B. T. Trego]] were widely published after his death (according to Edwin A. Peeples, "There is probably not an American History book which doesn't have (a) Trego picture in it").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 |title=James A. Michener Art Museum: Bucks County Artists |work=Michenermuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portrait painters in the U.S. in the 19th century included untrained limners such as [[Ammi Phillips]], and painters schooled in the European tradition, such as Thomas Sully and [[George Peter Alexander Healy|G.P.A. Healy]]. Middle-class city life found its painter in [[Thomas Eakins]] (1844–1916), an uncompromising realist whose unflinching honesty undercut the genteel preference for romantic sentimentalism. As a result, he was not notably successful in his lifetime, although he has since been recognized as one of the most significant U.S. artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa94.htm TFAOI.com]. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved July 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students was [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], the first African-American painter to achieve international acclaim.

A [[trompe-l'oeil]] style of [[still-life]] painting, originating mainly in Philadelphia, included Raphaelle Peale (one of several artists of the Peale family), [[William Michael Harnett]], and [[John F. Peto]].

The most successful U.S. sculptor of his era, [[Hiram Powers]], left the U.S. in his early thirties to spend the rest of his life in Europe, where he adopted a conventional style for his idealized female nudes such as ''Eve Tempted''.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of American Art (U.S.), &amp; Kloss, W. ''Treasures from the National Museum of American Art''. Washington: National Museum of American Art. 1985. pp. 189–190. {{ISBN|0874745950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several important painters who are considered American spent much of their lives in Europe, notably [[Mary Cassatt]], [[James McNeill Whistler]], and [[John Singer Sargent]], all of whom were influenced by French [[Impressionism]]. [[Theodore Robinson]] visited France in 1887, befriended [[Claude Monet|Monet]], and became one of the first U.S. painters to adopt the new technique. In the last decades of the century [[American Impressionism]], as practiced by artists such as [[Childe Hassam]] and [[Frank Weston Benson|Frank W. Benson]], became a popular style.

Controversy soon became a way of life for American artists. In fact, much of American painting and sculpture since 1900 has been a series of revolts against tradition. "To hell with the artistic values," announced [[Robert Henri]] (1865–1929). He was the leader of what critics called the [[Ashcan school]] of painting, after the group's portrayals of the squalid aspects of city life.

[[American realism]] became the new direction for American visual artists at the turn of the 20th century. The Ashcan painters [[George Bellows]], [[Everett Shinn]], [[George Benjamin Luks]], [[William Glackens]], and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] were among those who developed socially conscious imagery in their works. The photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946) led the [[Photo-Secession]] movement, which created pathways for photography as an emerging art form.

Soon the Ashcan school artists gave way to [[Modernism|modernists]] arriving from Europe—the cubists and abstract painters promoted by Stieglitz at his [[291 Gallery]] in New York City. [[John Marin]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Arthur B. Carles]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Henrietta Shore]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong|Wilhelmina Weber]], [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Gerald Murphy]] were some important early American modernist painters. Early modernist sculptors in America include [[William Zorach]], [[Elie Nadelman]], and [[Paul Manship]]. [[Florine Stettheimer]] developed an extremely personal faux-naif style.

After [[World War I]] many American artists rejected the [[modern art|modern]] trends emanating from the [[Armory Show]] and European influences such as those from the [[School of Paris]]. Instead they chose to adopt various—in some cases [[Academic art|academic]]—styles of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in depicting American urban and rural scenes. [[Grant Wood]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Guy Pène du Bois]], and [[Charles Sheeler]] exemplify the realist tendency in different ways. Sheeler and the modernists [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Ralston Crawford]] were referred to as [[Precisionism|Precisionists]] for their sharply defined renderings of machines and architectural forms. [[Edward Hopper]], who studied under Henri, developed an individual style of realism by concentrating on light and form, and avoiding overt social content.

===The American Southwest===
[[File:O'Keeffe Georgia Ram's Head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills,'' 1935, the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
{{Main article|Art of the American Southwest|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas#Southwest}}

Following the [[first World War]], the completion of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] enabled American settlers to travel across the west, as far as the [[California]] coast. New artists' colonies started growing up around [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], the artists' primary subject matter being the native people and landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].

Images of the Southwest became a popular form of advertising, used most significantly by the Santa Fe Railroad to entice settlers to come west and enjoy the "unsullied landscapes." [[Walter Ufer]], [[Bert Geer Phillips]], [[E. Irving Couse]], [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Andrew Dasburg]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] were some of the more prolific artists of the Southwest. Georgia O'Keeffe, who was born in the late 19th century, became known for her paintings featuring flowers, bones, and landscapes of [[New Mexico]] as seen in ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills''. O'Keeffe visited the Southwest in 1929 and moved there permanently in 1949; she lived and painted there until she died in 1986.

===Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s)===
{{See also|African American art|List of African American visual artists}}
The [[Harlem Renaissance]] was another significant development in American art. In the 1920s and 30s a new generation of educated and politically astute African-American men and women emerged who sponsored literary societies and art and industrial exhibitions to combat racist stereotypes. The movement, which showcased the range of talents within African-American communities, included artists from across America, but was centered in [[Harlem]]. The work of the Harlem painter and [[graphic art]]ist [[Aaron Douglas]] and the photographer [[James VanDerZee]] became emblematic of the movement. Artists associated with the Harlem Renaissance include [[Romare Bearden]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Charles Alston]], [[Augusta Savage]], [[Archibald Motley]], [[Lois Mailou Jones]], [[Palmer Hayden]] and [[Sargent Johnson]].

===New Deal art (1930s)===
{{see also|Federal Art Project|Section of Painting and Sculpture}}
[[File:People-of-Chilmark-Benton-1920-lrg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], ''People of Chilmark (Figure Composition),''  1920, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

When the [[Great Depression]] hit, president [[Franklin D Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] created several public arts programs. The purpose of the programs was to give work to artists and decorate public buildings, usually with a national theme. The first of these projects, the [[Public Works of Art Project]] (PWAP), was created after successful lobbying by the unemployed artists of the [[Artists Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpamurals.com/history.html History of the New Deal Art Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; The PWAP lasted less than one year, and produced nearly 15,000 works of art. It was followed by the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (FAP/WPA) in 1935, which funded some of the most well-known [[List of American artists|American artists]].&lt;ref name = "arnesen"&gt;Eric Arnesen, ed. ''Encyclopedia of U.S. labor and working-class history'' (2007) vol. 1 p. 1540&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of much of the public art commissioned by the WPA was influenced by the work of [[Diego Rivera]] and other artists of the contemporary [[Mexican muralism]] movement. Several separate and related movements began and developed during the [[Great Depression]] including [[American scene painting]], [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]], and [[Social Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10195 MoMA, The Collection, Social Realism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Grant Wood]], [[Maxine Albro]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Joseph Stella]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Isaac Soyer]], [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Spencer Baird Nichols]] and [[Jack Levine]] were some of the best-known artists.

Not all of the artists who emerged in the years between the wars were Regionalists or Social Realists; [[Milton Avery]]'s paintings, often nearly abstract, had a significant influence on several of the younger artists who would soon become known as Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, Bert. ''Milton Avery: a singular vision: [exhibition], Center for the Fine Arts, Miami.'' Miami, Florida: Trustees of the Center for the Fine Arts Association. 1987. p. 8. {{OCLC|19128732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Cornell]], inspired by [[Surrealism]], created boxed assemblages incorporating found objects and [[collage]].

===Abstract expressionism===

[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]] Number 11'', 1952, enamel and aluminium paint with glass on canvas, 212.1 x 488.9 cm, [[National Gallery of Australia]].

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists formed the first American movement to exert major influence internationally: [[abstract expressionism]].
This term, which had first been used in 1919 in Berlin, was used again in 1946 by [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and was taken up by the two major art critics of that time, [[Harold Rosenberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. It has always been criticized as too large and paradoxical, yet the common definition implies the use of [[abstract art]] to express feelings, emotions, what is within the artist, and not what stands without.

The first generation of abstract expressionists included [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], [[Theodoros Stamos]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and [[Hans Hofmann]], among others. [[Milton Avery]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Morris Graves]] and others were also related, important and influential artists during that period.

Though the numerous artists encompassed by this label had widely different styles, contemporary critics found several common points between them. Gorky, Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, Hofmann, Motherwell, Gottlieb, Rothko, Still, Guston, and others were an American painters associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] movement and in most cases [[Action painting]] (as seen in Kline's ''Painting Number 2'', 1954); as part of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] in the 1940s and 1950s.

Many first generation abstract expressionists were influenced both by the [[Cubist]]s' works (which they knew from photographs in art reviews and by seeing the works at the 291 Gallery or the Armory Show), by the European [[Surrealist]]s, and by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Henri Matisse]] as well as the Americans [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], and [[Hans Hofmann]]. Most of them abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects. Often the abstract expressionists decided to try instinctual, intuitive, spontaneous arrangements of space, line, shape and color. Abstract Expressionism can be characterized by two major elements: the large size of the canvases used (partially inspired by Mexican frescoes and the works they made for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] in the 1930s), and the strong and unusual use of brushstrokes and experimental paint application with a new understanding of process.

====Color Field painting====
The emphasis and intensification of color and large open expanses of surface were two of the principles applied to the movement called [[Color Field]] painting. Ad Reinhardt, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Barnett Newman were categorized as such. Another movement was called [[Action Painting]], characterized by spontaneous reaction, powerful brushstrokes, dripped and splashed paint and the strong physical movements used in the production of a painting. Jackson Pollock is an example of an Action Painter: his ''creative process'', incorporating thrown and dripped paint from a stick or poured directly from the can, revolutionized painting methods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 1'', Grolier Incorporated, Jan 1, 1999, p. 56, {{ISBN|0717201317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willem de Kooning]] famously said about Pollock "he broke the ice for the rest of us."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=cQBt2GVDQTcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=de+Kooning,+Pollock+he+broke+the+ice+for+the+rest+of+us&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7_9aziJ_bAhUB3iwKHe65BiYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20Kooning%2C%20Pollock%20he%20broke%20the%20ice%20for%20the%20rest%20of%20us&amp;f=false Carolyn Lanchner, ''Jasper Johns'', The Museum of Modern Art], New York, N.Y., 2009, p. 20, {{ISBN|087070768X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically Pollock's large repetitious expanses of linear fields are characteristic of Color Field painting as well, as [[art critic]] [[Michael Fried]] wrote in his essay for the catalog of ''Three American painters: [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Frank Stella]]'' at the [[Fogg Art Museum]] in 1965.
Despite the disagreements between art critics, Abstract Expressionism marks a turning-point in the history of American art: the 1940s and 1950s saw international attention shift from European (Parisian) art, to American (New York) art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=DABQAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+1940s+and+1950s+saw+international+attention+shift+from+European+(Parisian)+art,+to+American+(New+York)+art&amp;dq=the+1940s+and+1950s+saw+international+attention+shift+from+European+(Parisian)+art,+to+American+(New+York)+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUiaq0iZ_bAhWCFywKHcx8AOgQ6AEIMzAC Paul Cummings, ''American Drawings: the 20th Century''], Viking Press, University of Michigan, 1976, {{ISBN|0670117846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color field painting continued as a movement in the 1960s, as Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Gene Davis, [[Helen Frankenthaler]], and others sought to make paintings which would eliminate superfluous rhetoric with repetition, stripes and large, flat areas of color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1945_300299009.pdf William S. Rubin, ''Frank Stella''], The Museum of Modern Art, Distributed by New York Graphic Society, Greenwich, CT, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===After abstract expressionism===
[[File:RothkoBlackGray.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[Untitled (Black on Grey)]],'' 1970, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[New York City]]. One of Rothko's final paintings which relate closely to both [[Minimal art]] and [[Color Field painting]].]]

During the 1950s abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op Art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[Shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements like [[Pop Art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]].

Lyrical Abstraction along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to [[Dada]] and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, [[Color Field]] Painting, Hard-edge painting, [[Minimal Art]], Op art, [[Pop Art]], [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, [[Newsweek]] July 29, 1968: pp.3,55-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction shares similarities with Color Field Painting and Abstract Expressionism, especially in the freewheeling usage of paint texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting. However the styles are markedly different.&lt;ref name="Aldrich, Larry 1969, pp.104–113"&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qOYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 Thomas B. Hess on Larry Aldrich], Retrieved June 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s painters as powerful and influential as Adolph Gottlieb, [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], [[Paul Jenkins (painter)|Paul Jenkins]] and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Eric Fischl]] and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Other modern American movements===

[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) by [[Edward Hopper]] is one of his best-known works, [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
Members of the next artistic generation favored a different form of abstraction: works of mixed media. Among them were [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) and [[Jasper Johns]] (1930- ), who used photos, newsprint, and discarded objects in their compositions. [[Pop art]]ists, such as [[Andy Warhol]] (1928–1987), [[Larry Rivers]] (1923–2002), and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] (1923–1997), reproduced, with satiric care, everyday objects and images of American popular culture—Coca-Cola bottles, soup cans, comic strips.

Realism has also been continually popular in the United States, despite modernism's impact; the realist tendency is evident in the city scenes of [[Edward Hopper]], the rural imagery of [[Andrew Wyeth]], and the illustrations of [[Norman Rockwell]]. In certain places Abstract Expressionism never caught on; for example, in Chicago, the dominant art style was grotesque, symbolic realism, as exemplified by the [[Chicago Imagists]] [[Cosmo Campoli]] (1923–1997), [[Jim Nutt]] (1938- ), [[Ed Paschke]] (1939–2004), and [[Nancy Spero]] (1926–2009).

===Contemporary art into the 21st century===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
{{Main article|Contemporary art|Postmodern art|Late Modernism|Neo-conceptual art}}

At the beginning of the 21st century, contemporary art in the United States in general continues in several contiguous modes, characterized by the idea of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. The "crisis" in painting and current art and current [[art criticism]] today is brought about by [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]]. There is no consensus, nor need there be, as to a representative style of the age. There is an ''anything goes'' attitude that prevails; an "everything going on" syndrome; with no firm and clear direction and yet with every lane on the artistic [[superhighway]] filled to capacity. Consequently, magnificent and important works of art continue to be made in the United States albeit in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments, the marketplace being left to judge merit.

[[Hard-edge painting]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[Appropriation (art)|Appropriation]], [[Hyperrealism]], [[Photorealism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Minimalism]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], Pop art, Op art, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, [[Monochrome painting]], [[Neo-expressionism]], [[Collage]], [[Intermedia]] painting, [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] painting, [[Digital painting]], [[Postmodern]] painting, Neo-Dada painting, [[Shaped canvas]] painting, environmental [[mural painting]], [[Graffiti]], traditional [[figure painting]], [[Landscape painting]], [[Portrait painting]], are a few continuing and current directions in painting at the beginning of the 21st century.

'''Saint Vitus''' ({{IPAc-en|v|aɪ|t|ə|s}}), according to Christian legend, was a [[Christian]] [[saint]] from [[Sicily]]. He died as a [[martyr]] during the [[persecution of Christians]] by co-ruling [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperors]] [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in 303. Vitus is counted as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]] of medieval Roman Catholicism. 
Saint Vitus' Day is celebrated on 15 June. In places where the [[Julian Calendar]] is used, this date coincides, in the 20th and 21st centuries, with 28 June on the [[Gregorian Calendar]].

In the late [[Middle Ages]], people in [[Germany]] and countries such as [[Latvia]] celebrated the feast of Vitus by dancing before his statue. This dancing became popular and the name "Saint Vitus Dance" was given to the [[neurological disorder]] [[Sydenham's chorea]]. It also led to Vitus being considered the patron saint of dancers and of entertainers in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |title=Saint Vitus |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808173149/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |archive-date=2012-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitus is considered the [[patron saint]] of [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, and [[epileptic]]s, similarly to [[Genesius of Rome]]. He is also said to protect against [[lightning]] strikes, animal attacks and oversleeping. Vitus is the patron saint of the city of [[Rijeka]] in [[Croatia]]; the towns of [[Ciminna]] &amp; [[Vita, Sicily|Vita]] in [[Sicily]], [[Forio]] on the Island of [[Ischia]], in [[Campania]], [[Italy]]; the contrada of San Vito, in [[Torella dei Lombardi]], in [[Avellino]], [[Italy]]; the town of [[Winschoten]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in the [[Netherlands]], the italian colony of [[San Vito (Costa Rica)]] in Costa Rica, and the town of [[St. Vith]] located in [[Belgium]].  

Various places in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] are named [[Sankt Veit (disambiguation)|Sankt Veit]] in his honour.

==Martyrdom of Saints Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia==
[[File:Vitusmodestuscrescentia.jpg|thumb|left|The martyrdom of Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, from a fourteenth-century manuscript]]

According to the legend, Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia were martyrs under [[Diocletian]]. The earliest testimony for their veneration is offered by the "[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]" (ed. [[G. B. de Rossi]]-[[Louis Duchesne]], 78: "In Sicilia, Viti, Modesti et Crescentiae"). The fact that the note is in the three most important manuscripts indicates that it was also in the common exemplar of these, which appeared in the fifth century. The same ''Martyrologium'' has under the same day another mention of a Vitus at the head of a list of nine martyrs, with the statement of the place, in [[Eboli]], "In [[Lucania]]", that is, in the Roman province of that name in [[southern Italy]] between the Tuscan Sea and the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. It is easily possible that it is the same martyr Vitus in both cases.

According to J. P. Kirsch,&lt;ref&gt;The author of [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15490b.htm the article] in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] from which the information in this section is drawn&lt;/ref&gt; the testimony to the public veneration of the three saints in the fifth century proves that they are historical martyrs. There are, nevertheless, no historical accounts of them, nor of the time or the details of their martyrdom.

During the sixth and seventh centuries a purely legendary [[narrative]] of their martyrdom appeared which appears to be based upon other [[legend]]s, especially on the legend of [[Saint Potitus]], and ornamented with accounts of fantastic miracles. According to this legend, which has no apparent historical value, Vitus was a 7-year-old son of a senator of Lucania (some versions make him 12 years old). He resisted his father's attempts, which included various forms of torture, to make him turn away from his faith. He fled with his tutor Modestus and Modestus's wife Crescentia, who was Vitus's nanny, to Lucania. He was taken from there to Rome to [[exorcism|drive out a demon]] which had taken possession of a son of the Emperor Diocletian. This he did, and yet, because he remained steadfast in the Christian faith, he was [[tortured]] together with his tutors. By a [[miracle]] an [[angel]] brought back the three to Lucania, where they died from the tortures they had endured. Three days later Vitus appeared to a distinguished matron named Florentia, who then found the bodies and buried them in the spot where they were.

==Veneration==
[[File:St Vitus Cathedral from south.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Vitus Cathedral]] is the main church of the former imperial capital, [[Prague]].]]

The veneration of the martyrs spread rapidly in Southern Italy and Sicily, as is shown by the note in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". Pope [[Gregory the Great]] mentions a monastery dedicated to Vitus in Sicily ("Epist.", I, xlviii, P.L., LXXXVII, 511).

The veneration of St. Vitus, the chief saint of the group, also appeared very early at Rome. [[Pope Gelasius I]] (492-496) mentions a shrine dedicated to him (Jaffé, "Reg. Rom. Pont.", 2nd ed., I, 6 79), and at Rome in the seventh century the chapel of a deaconry was dedicated to him ("Liber Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 470 sq.).

In 756 AD, it is said that the [[relics]] of St. Vitus were brought to the [[Saint-Denis Abbey|monastery of St-Denis]] by [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. They were later presented to Abbot Warin of [[Corvey]] in Germany, who solemnly transferred some of them to this abbey in 836. From Corvey the veneration of St Vitus spread throughout Westphalia and in the districts of eastern and northern Germany. His cult grew in [[Prague]], Bohemia when, in 925 A.D., king [[Henry I of Germany]] presented as a gift the bones of one hand of St. Vitus to [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], Duke of Bohemia. Since then, this relic has been a sacred treasure in the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague.

The cult of St. Vitus became very popular in Slavic lands, where his name (Sveti Vid) may have replaced the old cult of the god of light [[Svetovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |title=SVIBOR - The Meaning and the Origin of the Word |publisher=Mzos.hr |date=1996-06-14 |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305105129/http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |archive-date=2012-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Serbia]] his feast day, known as '''[[Vidovdan]]''', is of particular historical importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Đorđević|first=Dimitrije |title=The role of St. Vitus Day in modern Serbian history|journal=Serbian Studies|volume=5|issue=3|date=Spring 1990|publisher=[[North American Society for Serbian Studies]]|url=http://www.serbianstudies.org/publications/pdf/Vol5_3_1990-%20DimitrijeDjordjevic-TheRoleofSt_VitusDayinModernSerbianHistory.pdf|pages=33–40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day is part of the [[Kosovo Myth]] — the [[Battle of Kosovo]] occurred on that day; several events have symbolically occurred on that day, such as the 1914 [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of the Austrian royal couple]]; Vitus was the patron saint of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].&lt;ref name="CoveWestwell2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dennis Cove|author2=Ian Westwell|title=History of World War I.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7DR_fheHdCAC&amp;pg=PA72|date=January 2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7231-5|page=72|quote=... was scheduled for June 28. This was a significant date for both Princip and the archduke. It was the day of St. Vitus, the patron saint of Serbia,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Croatia]], 123 churches are dedicated to St. Vitus. In [[Hungary]] he has been venerated as ''Szent Vid'' since the early Middle Ages. In [[Bulgaria]], it is called Vidovden (Видовден) or Vidov Den (Видов ден) and is particularly well known among the [[Shopi]], in the western part of the country.

Saint Vitus is one of the [[Fourteen Martyrs]] who give aid in times of trouble. He is specifically invoked against [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea]], which is called ''St. Vitus Dance''. 

He is represented as a young man with a palm-leaf, in a cauldron, sometimes with a raven and a lion, his [[Saint symbology|iconographic attribute]] because according to the legend he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling tar and molten lead, but miraculously escaped unscathed.

The names of Saints Modestus and Crescentia were added in the 11th century to the Roman Calendar,&lt;ref name=CR&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; so that from then on all three names were celebrated together until 1969, when their feast was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]]. Saint Vitus is still recognized as a saint of the [[Catholic Church]], being included in the [[Roman Martyrology]] under June 15,&lt;ref&gt;"Martyrologium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] may be celebrated in his honor on that day wherever the [[Roman Rite]] is celebrated,&lt;ref&gt;[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], [http://www.salesianer.de/liturgie/igmr2002.htm 355]&lt;/ref&gt; while Modestus and Crescentia, who are associated with Vitus in legend, have been omitted, because they appear to be merely fictitious personages.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

The saint's feast day is also the subject of a popular weather rhyme: "If St. Vitus' Day be rainy weather, it shall rain for thirty days together". This rhyme often appears in such publications as [[almanac]]s; its origin is uncertain.

Michael J. Towsend writes that "the phrase 'The patron saint of [[Methodism]] is St Vitus' summed up with reasonable accuracy many people's impressions of the Methodist Church. Methodists, surely, are supremely busy people, always rushing around organizing things and setting up committees to do good works. They can generally be relied upon to play their part in running [[Christian Aid Week]], the sponsored walk for the local hospice or the group protesting about homelessness, and they are known, even now, to be activists in trades unions and political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sacramental spirituality for  Methodism|last=Townsend|first=Michael J.|work=The Way|publisher=[[Society of Jesus]]|page=100|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water quality modeling''' involves the prediction of [[water pollution]] using [[mathematical model|mathematical simulation]] techniques. A typical [[water quality]] model consists of a collection of formulations representing physical mechanisms that determine position and momentum of [[pollutants]] in a water body.  Models are available for individual components of the hydrological system such as [[surface runoff]]; there also exist basinwide models addressing [[hydrologic transport model|hydrologic transport]] and for ocean and estuarine applications.  Often [[finite difference]] methods are used to analyse these phenomena, and, almost always, large complex [[computer model]]s are required.

==Formulations and  associated Constants==
Water quality is modeled by one or more of the following formulations:
* [[Advective Transport formulation]]
* [[Dispersive Transport formulation]]
* [[Surface Heat Budget formulation]]
* [[Dissolved Oxygen Saturation formulation]]
* [[Reaeration formulation]]
* [[Carbonaceous Deoxygenation formulation]]
* [[Nitrogenous Biochemical Oxygen Demand formulation]]
* [[Sediment oxygen demand formulation]] (SOD)
* [[Photosynthesis and Respiration formulation]]
* [[pH and Alkalinity formulation]]
* [[Nutrients formulation]] (fertilizers)
* [[Algae formulation]]
* [[Zooplankton formulation]]
* [[Coliform bacteria formulation]] (e.g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'')
