'''Autonomic Networking''' follows the concept of [[Autonomic Computing]], an initiative started by [[IBM]] in 2001. Its ultimate aim is to create self-managing networks to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of the [[Internet]] and other networks and to enable their further growth, far beyond the size of today.

== Increasing size and complexity ==

The ever-growing management complexity of the [[Internet]] caused by its rapid growth is seen by some experts as a major problem that limits its usability in the future.

What's more, increasingly popular [[smartphones]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], networked audio and video equipment,  and [[game consoles]] need to be interconnected. [[Pervasive Computing]] not only adds features, but also burdens existing networking infrastructure with more and more tasks that sooner or later will not be manageable by human intervention alone.

Another important aspect is the price of manually controlling huge numbers of vitally important devices of current network infrastructures.

== Autonomic nervous system ==

The [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS) is the part of the nervous system of the higher life forms that is not consciously controlled. It regulates bodily functions and the activity of specific organs. As proposed by [[IBM]], future communication systems might be designed in a similar way to the ANS. 

== Components of autonomic networking ==
As autonomics conceptually derives from biological entities such as the human autonomic nervous system, each of the areas can be metaphorically related to functional and structural aspects of a living being. In the human body, the autonomic system facilitates and regulates a variety of functions including respiration, blood pressure and circulation, and emotive response. The autonomic nervous system is the interconnecting fabric that supports feedback loops between internal states and various sources by which internal and external conditions are monitored.

=== Autognostics ===
[[Autognostics]] includes a range of self-discovery, awareness, and analysis capabilities that provide the autonomic system with a view on high-level state. In metaphor, this represents the perceptual sub-systems that gather, analyze, and report on internal and external states and conditions – for example, this might be viewed as the eyes, visual cortex and perceptual organs of the system. [[Autognostics]], or literally "self-knowledge", provides the autonomic system with a basis for response and validation.

A rich autognostic capability may include many different "perceptual senses". For example, the human body gathers information via the usual five senses, the so-called sixth sense of proprioception (sense of body position and orientation), and through emotive states that represent the gross wellness of the body. As conditions and states change, they are detected by the sensory monitors and provide the basis for adaptation of related systems. Implicit in such a system are imbedded models of both internal and external environments such that relative value can be assigned to any perceived state - perceived physical threat (e.g. a snake) can result in rapid shallow breathing related to fight-flight response, a phylogenetically effective model of interaction with recognizable threats.

In the case of autonomic networking, the state of the network may be defined by inputs from:
* individual network elements such as switches and network interfaces including
** specification and configuration
** historical records and current state
* traffic flows
* end-hosts
* application performance data
* logical diagrams and design specifications

Most of these sources represent relatively raw and unprocessed views that have limited relevance. Post-processing and various forms of analysis must be applied to generate meaningful measurements and assessments against which current state can be derived.

The autognostic system interoperates with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - to control network elements and interfaces
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - to define performance objectives and constraints
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - to identify attacks and accommodate the impact of defensive responses

=== Configuration management ===
Configuration management is responsible for the interaction with network elements and interfaces. It includes an accounting capability with historical perspective that provides for the tracking of configurations over time, with respect to various circumstances. In the biological metaphor, these are the hands and, to some degree, the memory of the autonomic system.

On a network, remediation and provisioning are applied via configuration setting of specific devices. Implementation affecting access and selective performance with respect to role and relationship are also applied. Almost all the "actions" that are currently taken by human engineers fall under this area. With only a few exceptions, interfaces are set by hand, or by extension of the hand, through automated scripts.

Implicit in the configuration process is the maintenance of a dynamic population of devices under management, a historical record of changes and the directives which invoked change. Typical to many accounting functions, configuration management should be capable of operating on devices and then rolling back changes to recover previous configurations. Where change may lead to unrecoverable states, the sub-system should be able to qualify the consequences of changes prior to issuing them.

As directives for change must originate from other sub-systems, the shared language for such directives must be abstracted from the details of the devices involved. The configuration management sub-system must be able to translate unambiguously between directives and hard actions or to be able to signal the need for further detail on a directive. An inferential capacity may be appropriate to support sufficient flexibility (i.e. configuration never takes place because there is no unique one-to-one mapping between directive and configuration settings). Where standards are not sufficient, a learning capacity may also be required to acquire new knowledge of devices and their configuration.

Configuration management interoperates with all of the other sub-systems including:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - receives direction for and validation of changes
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - implements policy models through mapping to underlying resources
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - applies access and authorization constraints for particular policy targets
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - receives direction for changes

=== Policy management ===
Policy management includes policy specification, deployment, reasoning over policies, updating and maintaining policies, and enforcement. [[Policy-based management]] is required for:
* constraining different kinds of behavior including security, privacy, resource access, and collaboration
* configuration management
* describing business processes and defining performance
* defining role and relationship, and establishing trust and reputation

It provides the models of environment and behavior that represent effective interaction according to specific goals. In the human nervous system metaphor, these models are implicit in the evolutionary "design" of biological entities and specific to the goals of survival and procreation. Definition of what constitutes a policy is necessary to consider what is involved in managing it. A relatively flexible and abstract framework of values, relationships, roles, interactions, resources, and other components of the network environment is required. This sub-system extends far beyond the physical network to the applications in use and the processes and end-users that employ the network to achieve specific goals. It must express the relative values of various resources, outcomes, and processes and include a basis for assessing states and conditions.

Unless embodied in some system outside the autonomic network or implicit to the specific policy implementation, the framework must also accommodate the definition of process, objectives and goals. Business process definitions and descriptions are then an integral part of the policy implementation. Further, as policy management represents the ultimate basis for the operation of the autonomic system, it must be able to report on its operation with respect to the details of its implementation.

The policy management sub-system interoperates (at least) indirectly with all other sub-systems but primarily interacts with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - providing the definition of performance and accepting reports on conditions
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - providing constraints on device configuration
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - providing definitions of roles, access and permissions

=== Autodefense ===
Autodefense represents a dynamic and adaptive mechanism that responds to malicious and intentional attacks on the network infrastructure, or use of the network infrastructure to attack IT resources. As defensive measures tend to impede the operation of IT, it is optimally capable of balancing performance objectives with typically over-riding threat management actions. In the biological metaphor, this sub-system offers mechanisms comparable to the immune system.

This sub-system must proactively assess network and application infrastructure for risks, detect and identify threats, and define effective both proactive and reactive defensive responses. It has the role of the warrior and the security guard insofar as it has roles for both maintenance and corrective activities. Its relationship with security is close but not identical – security is more concerned with appropriately defined and implemented access and authorization controls to maintain legitimate roles and process. Autodefense deals with forces and processes, typically malicious, outside the normal operation of the system that offer some risk to successful execution.

Autodefense requires high-level and detailed knowledge of the entire network as well as imbedded models of risk that allow it to analyze dynamically the current status. Corrections to decrease risk must be considered in balance with performance objectives and value of process goals – an overzealous defensive response can immobilize the system (like the immune system inappropriately invoking an allergic reaction). The detection of network or application behaviors that signal possible attack or abuse is followed by the generation of an appropriate response – for example, ports might be temporarily closed or packets with a specific source or destination might be filtered out. Further assessment generates subsequent changes either relaxing the defensive measures or strengthening them.

Autodefense interoperates closely with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Security|security]] - receives definition of roles and security constraints, and defines risk for proactive mitigation
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - receives details of network for analysis and directs changes in elements in response to anticipated or detected attack
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autognostics|autognostics]] - receives notification of detected behaviors

It also may receive definition of relative value of various resources and processes from policy management in order to develop responses consistent with policy.

=== Security ===
Security provides the structure that defines and enforces the relationships between roles, content, and resources, particularly with respect to access. It includes the framework for definitions as well as the means to implement them. In metaphor, security parallels the complex mechanisms underlying social interactions, defining friends, foes, mates and allies and offering access to limited resources on the basis of assessed benefit.

Several key means are employed by security – they include the well-known 3 As of authentication, authorization, and access (control). The basis for applying these means requires the definition of roles and their relationships to resources, processes and each other. High-level concepts like privacy, anonymity and verification are likely imbedded in the form of the role definitions and derive from policy. Successful security reliably supports and enforces roles and relationships.

Autodefense has a close association with security – maintaining the assigned roles in balance with performance exposes the system to potential violations in security. In those cases, the system must compensate by making changes that may sacrifice balance on a temporary basis and indeed may violate the operational terms of security itself. Typically the two are viewed as inextricably intertwined – effective security somewhat hopefully negating any need for a defensive response. Security’s revised role is to mediate between the competing demands from policy for maximized performance and minimized risk with auto defense recovering the balance when inevitable risk translates to threat. Federation represents one of the key challenges to be solved by effective security.

The security sub-system interoperates directly with:
* [[Autonomic Networking#Policy management|policy management]] - receiving high-level directives related to access and priority
* [[Autonomic Networking#Configuration management|configuration management]] - sending specifics for access and admission control
* [[Autonomic Networking#Autodefense|autodefense]] - receiving over-riding directives under threat and sending security constraint details for risk assessment

=== Connection fabric ===
The connection fabric supports the interaction with all the elements and sub-systems of the autonomic system. It may be composed of a variety of means and mechanisms, or may be a single central framework. The biological equivalent is the central nervous system itself – although referred to as the autonomic system, it actually is only the communication conduit between the human body’s faculties.

== Principles of autonomic networking ==

Consequently, it is currently under research by many [[Autonomic Networking#Research projects|research projects]], how principles and paradigms of mother nature might be applied to [[Computer networking|networking]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
Instead of a [[protocol stack|layering approach]], autonomic networking targets a more flexible structure termed [[Network Compartment|compartmentalization]].

=== Function re-composition ===
The goal is to produce an architectural design that enables flexible, dynamic, and fully autonomic formation of large-scale networks in which the functionalities of each constituent network node are also composed in an autonomic fashion

=== Atomization ===
Functions should be divided into atomic units to allow for maximal re-composition freedom.

=== Closed control loop ===
A fundamental concept of [[Control theory]], the [[closed control loop]], is among the fundamental principles of autonomic networking. A closed control loop maintains the properties of the controlled system within desired bounds by constantly monitoring target parameters.

'''Balseiro Institute''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Balseiro}}) is an academic institution chartered by the [[Universidad Nacional de Cuyo|National University of Cuyo]] and the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. It is located in [[Bariloche]], [[Río Negro province]], [[Argentina]]. Notable alumni of this institute include [[Marcela Carena]], [[Juan Maldacena]], and [[Jorge Pullin]].

==Overview==

[[File:Balseiro institute.jpg|thumb|One of the Classroom Buildings at the Instituto Balseiro.]]
[[File:Newtons apple.jpg|thumb|A reputed descendant of Newton's apple tree, found in the Instituto Balseiro library garden.]]

The Balseiro Institute teaches [[Physics]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Telecommunications Engineering]] at undergraduate and graduate levels. The institute admits students who have completed two years of university studies (either in Physics or Engineering) and undergoes a rigorous admission procedure.

It's considered the best Experimental Physics and Nuclear Engineering study centre of Latin America, as well as a very prestigious one worldwide. In fact, in 2012 the Balseiro institute was recognized among the best levels of education of the world displacing Princeton, Stanford and Columbia &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitemosmisiones.com/noticias/noticias/instituto-balseiro-bariloche-entre-los-10-mejores-del-mundo/ visitemos Misiones website – “Instituto Balseiro Bariloche entre los 10 mejores del Mundo” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a free public institution with a number of features that make it unique. It was created in 1955 and it was formalized in the agreement signed between the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and the National University of Cuyo (UNCuyo). Its objectives are reflected in the Resolution of the Rectorate 0445 of 1999, where both parties reiterate their willingness to jointly formulate the academic policy of the Balseiro Institute, joining forces in order to contribute jointly to the training of specialists in Sciences and Engineering and renew their objective to contribute to the research and development of activities that meet the interests of the country, through UNIVERSITY and CNEA. At the same time, the Balseiro Institute is an academic unit integrated to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB), which has state-of-the-art research and development laboratories to which IB students have access to practice.
It is noteworthy that all IB students receive full scholarships, allowing them a full dedication to the study. This, among other distinctive aspects, allows students of IB degree, master and postgraduate degrees to gain advanced training in both theoretical aspects as well as laboratory practice and technological innovation.

The students of the Balseiro Institute receive personalized education given the relationship, in quantity and quality, teacher-student. At the same time, these teachers are active researchers and technologists who are continuously linked both to scientific and technological centers and to technology companies in the country and the world. In this way, the acquired experience is transmitted to the students who are formed in a stimulating field of scientific research and technological development of vanguard; Face the challenge of growing professionally in a critical attitude and able to solve novel and highly complex problems. On the other hand, and following the original premise of Dr. José Balseiro, students practice in the first level laboratories of the CAB as an indissoluble part of their respective curricula. The training is completed with various optional subjects and special courses.

Thus, at the high academic level, there is the benefit of having a scholarship, which allows students to develop their career in a full way, with an innovative, inquisitive look and with a view to the challenges in science and technology that the present poses.
At the Balseiro Institute, degrees are given in Physics, Nuclear Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Telecommunications Engineering. It should be noted that the IB is the only institution in the country where Nuclear Engineering is taught at the undergraduate level. Also, they offer masters in Physics, Medical Physics and Engineering and PhDs in Physics, Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Sciences.

Other academic activities include the Specialization Course in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy (CEATEN), as well as the IB-CAB Solid Physics School, Summer Internships, Internship Internships with National and Foreign Universities and Summer Scholarships, Specialization, Workshops, Congresses, Conferences, Colloquia and Workshops.

Since the creation of the Balseiro Institute to date (April 2013) 963 graduates and engineers, 234 masters, 460 doctorates and 112 specialists graduated from CEATEN (Specialization in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy) graduated. Most of these professionals achieved a successful job placement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib.edu.ar/index.php/sobre-el-ib.html Balseiro Institute website – “Sobre el IB” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balseiro Institute works on a permanent basis with the mission of making a substantial contribution to the country's growth in science and technology through the training of scientists and technologists in both the nuclear area for peaceful and non-nuclear purposes. These achievements are achieved through the promotion and realization of high-level academic activities

== History ==
Nuclear research in the province of Rio Negro began as the [[Huemul Project]] in the Perón era. Nuclear facilities were organized as the [[Bariloche Atomic Centre]], under the direction of [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

An educational institution was established as the ''Instituto de Física de Bariloche'' on April 22, 1955, as a joint project of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[National University of Cuyo]]; the former administers the Bariloche Atomic Centre, whose work led to the first [[research reactor]] in Latin America (1957), as well as the region's first [[Generation II reactor|commercial reactor]], [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]], in 1974. The institute was renamed in 1962 to honor José Antonio Balseiro, who was its first director.

The first graduates were members of the Physics class of 1958. In the 1970s, Balseiro became the only institute in Argentina to grant degrees in [[nuclear engineering]], as the country was stepping up its nuclear program with the incorporation of the [[Embalse nuclear power plant|Embalse]] and [[Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha II]], as well as continued research activity in the Constituyentes and Bariloche reactors.

'''Brain Gym International''' is the [[trade name]] of the Educational Kinesiology Foundation, a California nonprofit organization that promotes a series of exercises called "Brain Gym" that the company claims improve academic performance. The underlying ideas are [[pseudoscience]], and as of 2014 there was no good evidence that the exercises are effective in improving learning.

==Business==
In the 1970s, Paul and Gail Dennison developed a set of physical exercises that they say improve children's ability to learn and that they say are based in neuroscience; they called their approach "educational kinesthesiology".&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee Evidence Check|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/091125-evidence-check-government-responses-to-questions-from-the-iuss-committee.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spaulding|first1=Lucinda S.|last2=Mostert|first2=Mark P.|last3=Beam|first3=Andrea P.|title=Is Brain Gym® an Effective Educational Intervention?|journal=Exceptionality|date=19 January 2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1080/09362830903462508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company makes money training people in the methods, and licenses the right to use the "Brain Gym" trademark to people whom it trains; the trained people use branded books and other materials they buy from the company.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;  Schools pay the trained people to work in schools, training teachers and working with students.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

In 2005 the company claimed to be selling its programs in 80 countries and by 2007 it had been widely covered in the press.&lt;ref name=wishful2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyatt|first1=K.

== Methods ==
The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air, and drinking water which are claimed to increase blood flow to the brain, "integrate" the brain, and "repattern" the brain.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre2010/&gt;

The claims of the organization for the effectiveness of its methods in improving educational outcomes were not supported by evidence as of 2014, and although the organization says the methods are grounded in good neuroscience, the underlying ideas are [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=Bad science : quacks, hacks, and big pharma flacks|date=2010|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=9781429967099|edition=First American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znCisNI4c8MC&amp;pg=PA15|chapter=2: Brain Gym}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-NN2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard-Jones|first1=Paul A.|title=Neuroscience and education: myths and messages|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=15 October 2014|volume=15|issue=12|pages=817–824|doi=10.1038/nrn3817|pmid=25315391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TES2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Hilary|last2=Rose|first2=Steven|title=The false promise of neuroeducation|journal=Times Educational Supplement|date=23 June 2016|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/false-promise-neuroeducation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard-Jones|first1=Paul|title=Neuroscience and Education: A Review of Educational Interventions and Approaches Informed by Neuroscience |url=https://v1.educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/uploads/pdf/NSED_LitReview_Final.pdf|publisher=The Education Endowment Foundation|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denton|first1=Carolyn A.|title=Physical Exercise and Movement-Based Interventions for Dyslexia|journal=Perspectives on Language and Literacy|date=Winter 2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=27–31|url=http://www.onlinedigeditions.com/article/Physical_Exercise_and_Movement-Based_Interventions_for_Dyslexia/625341/59673/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TLRP&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience and Education: Issues and Opportunities|publisher=[[Economic and Social Research Council]] Teaching and Learning Research Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015443/http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/Neuroscience%20Commentary%20FINAL.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2009|url=http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/Neuroscience%20Commentary%20FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=Linda Ann H.|title=Brain-based Pedagogy in Today’s Diverse Classrooms: A Perfect Fit—But Be Careful!|journal=The Delta Kappa Gamma Bulletin|date=Spring 2012|volume=78|issue=3|pages=42–47|url=http://www.deltakappagamma.org/NH/Spring%202012_Professional%20Development_2-27-12.pdf#page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://theconversation.com/how-neuroscience-is-being-used-to-spread-quackery-in-business-and-education-30342|title=How neuroscience is being used to spread quackery in business and education|work=Matt Wall|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the underlying ideas is that the exercises are meant to ‘balance’ the [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]] so the two "sides" work together better; there is also a notion of integrating the "top" parts of the brain with the "lower" parts of the brain to integrate thought and emotion, as well as integrating visual, auditory, and motor skills; these are all fairly common "neuromyths" based on work published by [[Samuel Orton]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-NN2014"/&gt;

Another idea is that of "brain buttons" - spots on the neck that if touched in certain ways, can stimulate the flow of blood to the brain.&lt;ref name=TLRP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sense2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/233/ |title=Sense About Science – Brain Gym |publisher=[[Sense About Science]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122215146/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/pdf/braingym.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2009 |quote=These exercises are being taught with pseudoscientific explanations that undermine science teaching and mislead children about how their bodies work. ... There have been a few peer reviewed scientific studies into the methods of Brain Gym, but none of them found a significant improvement in general academic skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of underlying ideas is [[psychomotor patterning]], also known as the Doman-Delacato theory of development, which claims that if motor skills are not acquired in the correct order, the result will be a lifelong deficit in learning ability, and also claims that these deficits can be overcome by going back and learning the skipped skills; this theory and claims to improve learning based on it were discredited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt; An example of this in the Brain Gym method, is to have children practice crawling.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

In 2009, after inquiries from the House of Commons, the UK [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] said that it had no policy on Brain Gym, and said that it was aware of substantial criticism, and was not aware of substantial research supporting Brain Gym's effectiveness.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

As of 2014, publications presenting research finding that the methods are effective in improving learning had not appeared in high quality journals, and the papers that had been published were widely condemned for methodological flaws and small sample sizes that made generalization not possible.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

[[Image:Trait-scale-bimodal.png|thumb|right|313px|[[Norms of reaction]] for two genotypes. Genotype B shows a strongly bimodal distribution indicating differentiation into distinct phenotypes. Each phenotype that results from genotype B is buffered against environmental variation—it is canalised.]]

'''Canalisation''' is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same [[phenotype]] regardless of variability of its environment or [[genotype]]. It is a form of [[robustness (evolution)|evolutionary robustness]]. The term was coined in 1942 by [[C. H. Waddington]] to capture the fact that "developmental reactions, as they occur in organisms submitted to [[natural selection]]...are adjusted so as to bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the course of the reaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waddington CH |title=Canalization of development and the inheritance of acquired characters |journal=Nature |volume=150 |pages=563–565 |year=1942 |doi=10.1038/150563a0 |issue=3811|bibcode=1942Natur.150..563W }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this word rather than robustness to take into account that biological systems are not robust in quite the same way as, for example, engineered systems.

Biological robustness or canalisation comes about when [[developmental biology|developmental pathways]] are [[evolutionary developmental biology|shaped by evolution]]. Waddington introduced the concept of the [[epigenetic landscape]], in which the state of an organism rolls "downhill" during development. In this metaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley (which he called a [[creode]]) enclosed by high ridges, safely guiding the phenotype to its "fate". Waddington claimed that canals form in the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful for understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waddington CH |title=The strategy of the genes |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic assimilation==

Waddington used the concept of canalisation to explain his experiments on [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2405747 |author=Waddington CH |title=Genetic assimilation of an acquired character |journal=Evolution|volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=118–126 |year=1953 |jstor=2405747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, he exposed ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[pupa]]e to heat shock. This environmental disturbance caused some flies to develop a [[crossveinless]] [[phenotype]]. He then [[Artificial selection|selected]] for crossveinless. Eventually, the crossveinless phenotype appeared even without heat shock. Through this process of genetic assimilation, an environmentally induced phenotype had become inherited. Waddington explained this as the formation of a new canal in the [[epigenetic]] landscape.

It is, however, possible to explain genetic assimilation using only [[quantitative genetics]] and a threshold model, with no reference to the concept of canalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/282040 |author=Stern C |title=Selection for subthreshold differences and the origin of pseudoexogenous adaptations |journal=American Naturalist|volume=92 |pages=313–316 |year=1958 |issue=866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateman KG |title=The genetic assimilation of the dumpy phenocopy |journal=American Naturalist|volume=56 |pages=341–351 |year=1959 |doi=10.1007/bf02984790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000433 |author=Scharloo W |title=Canalization – genetic and developmental aspects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22 |pages=65–93 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Falconer DS, Mackay TF |title=Introduction to Quantitative Genetics |pages=309–310 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, theoretical models that incorporate a complex [[genotype–phenotype map]] have found evidence for the evolution of phenotypic robustness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.102303999 |vauthors=Siegal ML, Bergman A |title=Waddington's canalization revisited: Developmental stability and evolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99 |issue=16 |pages=10528–10532 |year=2002 |pmid=12082173 |pmc=124963|bibcode=2002PNAS...9910528S }}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to genetic assimilation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Masel J |title=Genetic assimilation can occur in the absence of selection for the assimilating phenotype, suggesting a role for the canalization heuristic |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=1106–1110 |year=2004 |pmid=15312082| doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00739.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; even when selection is only for developmental stability and not for a particular phenotype, and so the quantitative genetics models do not apply. These studies suggest that the canalisation heuristic may still be useful, beyond the more simple concept of robustness.

==Congruence hypothesis==

Neither canalisation nor robustness are simple quantities to quantify: it is always necessary to specify which trait is canalised (robust) to which perturbations. For example, perturbations can come either from the environment or [[mutational robustness|from mutations]]. It has been suggested that different perturbations have '''congruent''' effects on development taking place on an epigenetic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meiklejohn CD, Hartl DL |title=A single mode of canalization |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17 |pages=e9035 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02596-X |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-010X(20001015)288:3&lt;242::AID-JEZ5&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |vauthors=Ancel LW, Fontana W |title=Plasticity, evolvability, and modularity in RNA |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology |volume=288 |issue=3 |pages=242–283 |year=2000 |pmid=11069142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msp008 |vauthors=Szöllősi GJ, Derényi I |title=Congruent Evolution of Genetic and Environmental Robustness in Micro-RNA|journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution|volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=867–874 |year=2009 |pmid=19168567 |arxiv=0810.2658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2411105 |vauthors=Wagner GP, Booth G, Bagheri-Chaichian H | title=A population genetic theory of canalization| journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=329–347|year=1997 |jstor=2411105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lehner B |last2=Lehner |first2=Ben |title=Genes Confer Similar Robustness to Environmental, Stochastic, and Genetic Perturbations in Yeast|journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=468–473 |year=2010 |pmid=20140261 |pmc=2815791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009035 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009035 |editor1-last=Polymenis |editor1-first=Michael|bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9035L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, however, depend on the molecular mechanism responsible for robustness, and be different in different cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.07.005 |author=Masel J Siegal ML |title=Robustness: mechanisms and consequences |journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=395–403 |year=2009 |pmid=19717203 |pmc=2770586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary capacitance==

The canalisation metaphor suggests that phenotypes are very robust to small perturbations, for which development does not exit the canal, and rapidly returns down, with little effect on the final outcome of development. But perturbations whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold will break out of the canal, moving the developmental process into uncharted territory. Strong robustness up to a limit, with little robustness beyond, is a pattern that could increase [[evolvability]] in a fluctuating environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel I, Matessi C |title=Canalization, genetic assimilation and preadaptation. A quantitative genetic model |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=2119–33 |year=1998 |pmid=9691063 |pmc=1460279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic canalisation could allow for [[evolutionary capacitance]], where genetic diversity outside the canal accumulates in a population over time, sheltered from [[natural selection]] because it does not normally affect phenotypes. This hidden diversity could then be unleashed by extreme changes in the environment or by molecular switches, releasing previously cryptic genetic variation that can then contribute to a rapid burst of evolution.

In [[computer security]] a '''countermeasure''' is an action, [[peripheral|device]], [[Procedure (term)|procedure]], or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the [[harm]] it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.

The definition is as [[IETF]] RFC 2828&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; that is the same as CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by [[Committee on National Security Systems]] of United States of America.&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Glossary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf InfosecToday Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.infosectoday.com InfosecToday], the meaning of countermeasure is:
:The deployment of a set of security services to protect against a security threat.

A synonym is [[Security controls|security control]].&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

In telecommunications, communication countermeasures are defined as [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] as part of [[OSI model|OSI Reference model]] by ITU-T X.800 Recommendation.
X.800 and ISO ISO 7498-2 (Information processing systems – Open systems interconnection – Basic Reference Model – Part 2: Security architecture are technically aligned.

The following picture explain the relationships between these concepts and terms:
&lt;pre&gt;
      + - - - - - - - - - - - - +  + - - - - +  + - - - - - - - - - - -+

&lt;/pre&gt;
A resource (both physical or logical) can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat agent in a threat action. The result can potentially compromises the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers).&lt;br /&gt;
The so-called CIA triad is the basis of [[information security]].

The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A "passive attack" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources, compromising confidentiality.

A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger enabling the exploitation of a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

A set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

== Countermeasures Against Physical Attacks ==
If a potential malicious actor has physical access to a computer system, they have a greater chance of inflicting harm upon it.

=== Electronic Destruction Devices ===
Devices such as a [[USB Killer]] may be used to damage or render completely unusable anything with a connection to the [[motherboard]] of a computer, such as a USB port, video port, Ethernet port, or serial port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/usb-killer-fries-devices/|title=USB Killer, yours for $50, lets you easily fry almost every device|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper protection, these devices may result in the destruction of ports, [[Expansion card|adapter cards]], storage devices, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], motherboards, CPUs, or anything physically connected to the device attacked, such as monitors, flash drives, or [[Network switch|wired switches]]. These types of devices can even be used to damage smartphones and cars, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techfonder.com/2017/10/this-50-usb-killer-can-destroy-your-every-device-in-seconds.html|title=This $50 USB Killer Can Destroy Almost Any Smartphone, Computer Or Car Within Seconds|work=TechFonder|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This threat can be mitigated by not installing or restricting physical access to easily accessible ports in situations where they are not necessary. A port-closing lock which permanently disables access to a port short of the actual port being disassembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mouser.com/blog/protect-usb-ports-from-nefarious-usb-killers|title=Bench Talk {{!}} Protect USB Ports From Nefarious “USB Killers"|website=www.mouser.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is necessary for a port to be accessible, an [[Opto-isolator|optocoupler]] can allow for a port to send and receive data to a computer or device without a direct electrical connection, preventing the computer or device from receiving any dangerous voltage from an external device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/optocoupler.html|title=Optocoupler Tutorial|last=|first=|date=|website=ElectronicsTutorials|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard Drives and Storage ===
In an unsecured scenario, a malicious actor may steal or destroy storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, resulting in the destruction or theft of valuable data.

If the data of a storage device is no longer necessary, data theft is best prevented against by physically destroying or shredding the storage device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Discarded-hard-drives-can-be-dangerous|title=Discarded hard drives can be dangerous|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the data of a storage device is in use and must be secured, one can use encryption to encrypt the contents of a storage device, or even [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|encrypt the whole storage device]] save for the master boot record. The device can then be unlocked with a password, [[biometric authentication]], a physical dongle, a network interchange, a [[one-time password]], or any combination thereof. If this device is a boot drive, however, it must be unencrypted in a pre-boot environment so the operating system can be accessed. [[Data striping|Striping]], or breaking data into chunks stored upon multiple drives which must be assemble in order to access the data, is a possible solution to physical drive theft, provided that the drives are stored in multiple, individually secured locations, and are enough in number that no one drive can be used to piece together meaningful information.

Not the be neglected is the process of adding physical barriers to the storage devices themselves. Locked cases or physically hidden drives, with a limited amount of personnel with knowledge and access to the keys or locations, may prove to be a good first line against physical theft.

'''Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources''' is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved [[cryogenics|cryogenically]].&lt;ref name=cryo&gt;"Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources", Rep. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2012. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines No. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Animal genetic resources, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are "those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and [[feral]] populations, [[landrace]]s and primary populations, standardised [[breed]]s, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds."&lt;ref&gt;FAO.

Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds. Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders. Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Verrier, E., Danchin-Burge, C., Moureaux, S., Ollivier, L., Tixier-Boichard, M., Boichard, D., ... &amp; Clement, F. 2003.

==Description==
Cryoconservation is the process of freezing cells and tissues using liquid nitrogen to achieve extreme low temperatures with the intent of using the preserved sample to prevent the loss of genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Yawn, David H.

==Value==
Cryoconservation is an indispensable tool in the storage of genetic material of animal origin and will continue to be useful for the conservation of livestock into the future. Cryoconservation serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenbroek, Kor, ed. Utilisation and Conservation of Farm Animal Genetic Resources. Wegeningen Academic Publisher, 2007. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems.&lt;ref name=men /&gt; Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, Gerold."Contribution of Rural Tourism to the Market for Livestock Products in LFAs in Germany." The James Hutton Institute. Livestock Systems in Integrated Rural Development, n.d. Web. May 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are of the utmost importance for food security and sustainability.&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

Another beneficial factor in cryoconservation of indigenous livestock is in terms of food security and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, K., T. Collins, S. Dion, H. Reynolds, S. Riess, A. Stanzyk, A. Wolfe, S. Lonergan, P. Boettcher, U. R. Charrondiere, and B. Stadimayr.

Animal Frontiers Oct. 2012: 54–60. American Society of Animal Science.
  Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous livestock often have beneficial traits related to adaptation to local climate and diseases that can be incorporated into major breeds through cryoconservation practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bett, Rawlynce, Mwai Okeyo, Birgitta Malmfors, Kjell Johansson, Morris Agaba, Donald Kugonza, A.K.F.H. Bhuiyan, Anibal Filho, Arthur Mariante, Fidalis Mujibi, and Jan Philipsson. "[http://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/2/3/335htm Cattle Breeds: Extinction or Quasi-Extant?]" Resources 2.3 (2013): 335–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Cryoconservation is a favorable strategy because it allows germplasms to be stored for extended periods of time in a small confined area. An additional benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to preserve the biological material of both maternal and paternal cells and maintain viability over extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=mazur /&gt;&lt;ref name=men /&gt; Cryoconservation has been successfully used as a conservation strategy for species and breeds that have since been endangered. One drawback is that cryoconservation can only be done if preparation has taken place in advance.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; With proper preparation of collecting and maintaining genetic material, this method is very beneficial for the conservation of rare and endangered livestock. Cryoconservation can serve as a contingency plan when a breed population needs to be restored or when a breed has become extinct, as well as for breed improvement. This process benefits companies and researchers by making genetic materials available.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

The support of numerous stakeholders make this process possible in the establishment and operations of cryoconservation. Before every phase is executed, all participating stakeholders must be briefed to understand the possible phase impending. This would include informing the stakeholders of their responsibilities and receiving their consent for the cryoconservation process.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; The possible stakeholders within the cryoconservation process could include:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*The State-the government acquires responsibility for conservation of animal genetic resources&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
*Individual Livestock Keepers and Breed Associations-individual livestock keepers are commonly the primary owners of the livestock whose germplasm is used for processes of cryoconservation. Breed Associations would be interested in the well-being of their respective breeds in short and long terms. Through this interest these associations may provide financial and organizational support for the cryoconservation process.&lt;ref name=strategies /&gt;

==Methods==
===Collection===
There are several ways to collect the genetic materials based on which type of germplasm.

==== Semen ====
[[Freezing semen]] is a commonly used technique in the modern animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, R. "Collection and Evaluation of Semen: Introduction and Index." Collection and Evaluation of Semen. Colorado State University, January 27, 2003. Web. May 13, 2016. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is often collected using an [[artificial vagina]], [[electroejaculation]], gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools.  Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen.&lt;ref name="sites.ext.vt.edu"&gt;Estienne, Mark, and Allen Harper. "Swine Artificial Insemination Programs: Techniques for Training Boars for Semen Collection." Swine Artificial Insemination Programs: Techniques for Training Boars for Semen Collection. Virginia Cooperative Extension, Jan. 2000. Web. May 17, 2016. http://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/newsletter-archive/livestock/aps-00_01/aps-0178.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas that can be used depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male.&lt;ref name="sites.ext.vt.edu"/&gt; Electroejaculation is a method of [[semen collection]] in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male.&lt;ref&gt;Rouge, Melissa, and R. Bowen. "Semen Collection." Semen Collection. Colorado State University, August 11, 2002. Web. May 13, 2016. http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/semeneval/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen.&lt;ref&gt;"Collecting Semen from Boars." The State of Queensland (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries). Queensland Government, July 2, 2002. Web. May 13, 2016. https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/pigs/improving-your-herd-with-genetics/collecting-semen-from-boars&lt;/ref&gt; Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca.&lt;ref&gt;Miyumo, Sophie. "Artificial Insemination in Chicken." Artificial Insemination in Chicken. Indigenous Chicken Improvement Programme., n.d. Web. May 13, 2016.http://www.incip.org/index.php/component/k2/item/88-artificial-insemination-in-chicken&lt;/ref&gt; However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.&lt;ref&gt;"Cloaca." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d. Web. May 17, 2016. http://www.britannica.com/science/cloaca&lt;/ref&gt;

====Embryo====
Embryo collection is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located inside of the body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used in order to have a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew J., and Sherrill E. Echternkamp. "[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153&amp;context=hruskareports Superovulation of Cows by Initiating FSH Treatments During the First Few Days After Estrus]." Published
  in Beef Research Program Progress Report 4 (1993): 80–82. U.S. Department of Agriculture: Agriculture Research Services. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;Pomar, F.j. Rubio, K.j. Teerds, A. Kidson, B. Colenbrander, T. Tharasanit, B. Aguilar, and B.AJ. Roelen. "[https://www.academia.edu/download/43066004/Differences_in_the_incidence_of_apoptosi20160225-25808-16hrutw.pdf Differences in the Incidence of Apoptosis between in Vivo and in Vitro Produced Blastocysts of Farm Animal Species: A Comparative Study]." Theriogenology 63.8 (2005): 2254–268. Science
Direct. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less.&lt;ref&gt;Selk, Glenn. Embryo Transfer in Cattle. N.d. Fact Sheet. Oklahoma State University Extension Service. PDF. Web. May 13, 2016. http://www.thejudgingconnection.com/pdfs/Embryo_Transfer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female.&lt;ref name=embryo &gt;Hirayama, Hiroki, Soichi Kageyama, Satoru Moriyasu, Ken Sawai, and Akira Minamihashi.

Journal of Reproduction and Development J. Reprod. Dev. 59.4 (2013): 321–26. US National Library of Medicine Nation Institutes of Health. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos.&lt;ref&gt;Valojerdi, Mojtaba Rezazadeh, Poopak Eftekhari-Yazdi, Leila Karimian, Fatemeh Hassani, and Bahar Movaghar.

Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Oocytes====
Oocytes can be collected from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries are removed from a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities.&lt;ref name=invitro &gt;"In Vitro Embryos from Unknown Oocyte Source." C.A.S.E. Reproductive Services. University of Wisconsin-Madison, n.d. Web. May 14, 2016. http://www.ansci.wisc.edu/jjp1/ansci_repro/misc/project_websites_fa06/tues06/oocyte/IVF.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization.&lt;ref name=invitro /&gt; Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Farsi, Mir Mehrdad, Nematollah Kamali, and Mohsen Pourghasem. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920538/ Embryological Aspects of Oocyte In Vitro Maturation]."International Journal of Molecular and Cellular Medicine 2.3 (2013): 99–109. US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health. Babol University of Medical Sciences. Web. May 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method is the ability to expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her [[estrous cycle]]. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Joel A., Shane Bellow, Marius Meintjes, Oscar Perez, Edward Ferguson, and Robert A. Godke."[https://www.arch-anim-breed.net/45/99/2002/aab-45-99-2002.pdf Transvaginal Ultrasound-guided Oocyte Aspiration for Production of Embryos in Vitro]." Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology 45.1 (2002): 99–108. Research Gate. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somatic cells====
Somatic cells are an additional resource which can be retrieved for gene banking, particularly in the cases of emergency wherein gametes cannot be collected or stored. Tissues can be taken from living animals or shortly after death. These tissues can be saved via cryopreservation or dehydrated. Blood cells can also be useful for DNA analysis such as comparing homozygosity&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Donald E. "DNA Testing: An Introduction For Non-Scientists." Scientific Testimony. University of Washington, April 6, 2005. Web. May 19, 2016.  http://www.scientific.org/tutorials/articles/riley/riley.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Araújo, Adriana Mello De,Simone Eliza Facioni Guimarães, Thea Mírian Medeiros Machado, Paulo Sávio Lopes, Carmen Silva Pereira, Francisco Luiz Ribeiro Da Silva, Marcelo Teixeira Rodrigues, Virgínia De Souza Columbiano, and Cleusa Graça Da Fonseca.

Genetics and Molecular Biology Genet. Mol. Biol. 29.1 (2006): 67–74. Scientific Electronic Library. Web. May 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended by the FAO that two vials of blood be drawn to reduce the chance that all samples will be lost from a particular animal. DNA can be extracted using commercial kits, making this an affordable and accessible strategy for collecting germplasms.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

===Freezing===
There are two cryopreservation freezing methods: slow freezing and vitrification. [[File:Example freezing laboratory.png|thumb|Example freezing laboratory]]

====Slow freezing====
During slow freezing, cells are placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As the water in the medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and cryoprotectant equal. The water that leaves the cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to diffuse out of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.&lt;ref name=cryo/&gt;

====Vitrification====
The second technique for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without the formation of crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the water will leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification is considered to be the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.&lt;ref name=loutradi/&gt;

==Facility design and equipment==
===Facility design===
[[File:Example of animal holding and collecting.png|thumb|Example of animal holding and collecting facility]]
When designing a facility, there are several things that should be kept in mind including biosecurity, worker safety and efficiency, and animal welfare. Diverse infrastructure is required in order to successfully collect and store genetic material. The buildings needed depend on the size of facilities as well as the extent of the operations.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Biosecurity====
Biosecurity, a management measure used to prevent the transmission of diseases and disease agents on the facility, is important to keep in mind when designing a facility.&lt;ref&gt;
Floss, Jeanette L., and Roderick C. Tubbs. "Herd Management for Disease Prevention." Herd Management for Disease Prevention. University of Missouri-Columbia, July 1993. University of Missouri Extension Publication Number G2507 16 May 2016. URI:http://hdl.handle.net?10355/710.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve a high level of biosecurity, collection facilities should be placed as far as possible from one another, as well as from farms. According to the FAO's recommendations, facilities should be "at least 3 km from farms or other biological risks and 1 km from main roads and railways".&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Separation between collection facilities and surrounding farms can improve biosecurity as pests, such as flies and mice, have the potential to travel from farm to facility and vice versa. Other disease agents may be able to travel through the air via wind, furthering the importance of separation of farms and proper air sanitation and ventilation. Additionally, a [[perimeter fence]] is used to prevent potential threats that could cause contamination to germplasms, such as unauthorized personnel or unwanted animals, from entering the facilities. Animals may be housed in [[pen (enclosure)|pens]] located inside or outside of a barn as long as they are contained within the perimeter fence. When interaction with outside objects, such as feed trucks or veterinary personnel, is necessary, complete sanitation is required to decrease the risk of contamination. There is always the possibility of disease spreading among the animals whose biological data is being collected or from animal to human. An example of a disease that can easily spread through germplasm is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, otherwise known as PRRS. A highly contagious disease between swine, PRRS causes millions of dollars to be lost annually by producers. The disease can be spread through boar semen.&lt;ref&gt;Yaeger, Michael J., Thomas Prieve, James Collins, Jane Christopher-Hennings, Eric Nelson, and Davis Benefield. "Evidence for the Transmission of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Virus in Boar Semen." Swine Health and Production 1.5 (1993): 7–9. American Association of Swine Veterinarians. American Association of Swine Veterinarians. Web. 18 May.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, biosecurity is particularly important when genetic material will be inserted into another animal to prevent the spread of such diseases.

====Human considerations====
Worker safety is always a priority when handling livestock. Escape routes and alternative access throughout the facility are crucial for both the handlers and livestock.&lt;ref name=behaviour&gt;"Behavioural Principles of Handling Cattle and Other Grazing Anima ls Under Extensive Conditions." Livestock Handling and Transport. Ed. Temple Grandin. Wallingford: CABI, 2000. 67–68. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Germplasm storage and collection sites must include locker rooms for staff, which provide lockers, showers, and storage of clothing and footwear, in order to meet sanitation requirements.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Animal considerations====
Animal housing practical when collecting germplasms because they keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making the process of collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal to become familiar with the process is key.&lt;ref name=behaviour /&gt; Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref name=embryo/&gt;

====Temperature control and ventilation====
[[Temperature control]] and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] should be included in the design of the holding and collection facilities to keep the animals comfortable and healthy, while limiting stress during the germplasm collection process. Ventilation serves as an effective way to keep clean airflow throughout the facilities and eliminate odors Temperature control helps regulate the air quality and humidity level inside the barn.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

====Equipment====
A freezing and processing laboratory for genetic materials can be on the same site as the holding and collecting facility. However, the laboratory must have higher sanitation standards. According to the FAO, a proper germplasm laboratory should include the following.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*Washable work surfaces, floors (non-slip) and walls
*Sufficient lighting and ventilation
*Hot and cold, purified water
*Electrical sockets
*Adequate storage for consumable materials.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
{{col-end}}

Cryopreservation requires equipment to collect biological material and test tubes for storage. Price is highly variable based on the quality of the collection and storage materials.&lt;ref name=Guide &gt;Brockbank, Dr. Kelvin G. M., James C. Covault, and Dr. Michael J. Taylor. "Cryoconservation Guide." Dr. Michael J. Taylor. Web. May 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy of tools should be considered when determining costs.&lt;ref name=Guide /&gt; In addition to traditional laboratory equipment, the FAO also suggests the following:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*Disposable coveralls
*Portable incubator
*Haemocytometer
*Semen straws and filling/sealing equipment
*Liquid nitrogen storage tank
*Liquid nitrogen
*Liquid nitrogen dry-shipper
*Equipment for determining sperm concentration (one or more of the following three):
*Spectrophotometer (fixed or portable)
*Makler counter chamber (or disposable counting chamber)
*Haemocytometer
*Straw filling and sealing equipment
*Freezing equipment (manual or programmable)
*Carbon dioxide incubator (for embryos)
*Laminar flow benches (for embryos)
*Dry liquid nitrogen shipping tanks
*Long-term liquid nitrogen storage tanks.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;

==Limitations==
Cryoconservation is limited by the cells and tissues that can be frozen and successfully thawed. Cells and tissues that can be successfully frozen are limited by their surface area. To keep cells and tissues viable, they must be frozen quickly to prevent ice crystal formation. Thus, a large surface area is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Özkavukçu, Sinan, and Esra Erdemli. "Cryopreservation: Basic Knowledge And Biophysical Effects." Journal of Ankara Medical School 24.4 (2002): 187–96. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation is the species being preserved. There have been difficulties using particular methods of cryoconservation with certain species. For example, artificial insemination is more difficult in sheep than cattle, goats, pigs, or horses due to posterior folds in the cervix of ovines.&lt;ref name=Menzies/&gt; Cryopreservation of embryos is dependent on the species and the stage of development of the embryo. Pig embryos are the most difficult to freeze, thaw, and utilize produce live offspring due to their sensitivity to chilling and high lipid content.&lt;ref name=Mcevoy/&gt;

==Legal issues==
The collection and utilization of genetic materials requires clear agreements between stakeholders with regards to their rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; The FAO and others, such as Mendelsohn, suggests that governments establish policies with regards to livestock genetic resources and their collection, storage, distribution, and utilization are governments.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;&lt;ref name=men /&gt; The FAO also recommends that national or regional livestock industries establish an advisory committee to advise and provide recommendations on policy.  Livestock are traditionally a private good; in order to obtain ownership of genetic materials, gene banks have several strategies that they can deploy.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Gene banks may either:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*buy the livestock in order to obtain and preserve genetic information
*have the germplasm donated by livestock owner
*pay a fee to the livestock owner for germplasm rights
*develop a contract with the livestock owner in order to obtain germplasm ownership only after set period of time, in order to prevent immediate acquisition of germplasm by competitors&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt;
One of the key elements of cryoconservation of livestock is open access to genetic materials, to make the resources of these conserved genetic materials accessible for utilization. Utilization should be based on sustainable use, development, and conservation, as well as improvement for the livestock industry.&lt;ref name=cryo /&gt; Government and non-governmental organizations recommend that genetic information should have open access for the following purposes:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
*national public need
*non-research breeding by non-governmental organizations or private entities
*research for breed improvement, conservation of endangered breeds, and potential recovery of extinct breeds&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

==Examples==
===Hungarian Grey cattle===
An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the [[Hungarian Grey cattle]], or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9&amp;nbsp;million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of [[World War II]] and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt; The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production.&lt;ref&gt;Bartosiewicz, L. "[http://www.cattlenetwork.net/docs/agri/agri21_4.pdf The Hungarian Grey Cattle: A Traditional European Breed]." Animal Genetic Resources Information Anim. Genet. Resour. Inf. 21 (1997): 49–60. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates.&lt;ref name=solti /&gt;&lt;ref name=dadis&gt;"Magyar Szurke/Hungarian Grey."

[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Crystal Ball.JPG|thumb|''[[The Crystal Ball (painting)|The Crystal Ball]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].]]
A '''crystal ball''', also known as an '''orbuculum''', is a [[crystal]] or [[glass]] ball and common [[fortune telling]] object.{{efn|Sometimes further referred to as a ''shew stone'' (or ''show stone'' {{ndash}} "shew" is an archaic spelling of "show").}} It is generally associated with the performance of [[clairvoyance]] and [[scrying]] in particular.

==History==
The earliest use of a crystal ball can be first attributed to the Celtic [[Druid]]s who divined the future and omens with [[beryl]] balls.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] describes use of crystal balls by [[Fortune-telling|soothsayers]] (''"crystallum orbis"'', later written in [[Medieval Latin]] by scribes as ''orbuculum'').&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|title=Caii Plinii Secundi Historiæ naturalis libri xxxvii, cum selectis comm. J. Harduini ac recentiorum interpretum novisque adnotationibus|date=1831|page=579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkIAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22orbis+crystallum%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=7 November 2015}} {{La icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 5th century AD, scrying was widespread within the [[Roman Empire]] and was condemned by the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|early medieval Christian Church]] as [[Christian views on magic|heretical]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal gazing|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/crystal-gazing|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] was a noted British mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and consultant to [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He devoted much of his life to alchemy, divination, and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] philosophy, of which the use of crystal balls was often included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ensemble.va.com.au/tableau/suzy/TT_ResearchProjects/Hexen2039/JohnDee/JD_CBall.html John Dee's Crystal Ball]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal gazing was a popular pastime in the [[Victorian era]], and was claimed to work best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately before the appearance of a vision, the ball was said to mist up from within.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Art of scrying==
{{main article|Scrying|Crystal gazing}}
[[Image:Glaskugel CrystalBall.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of a [[quartz]] crystal ball of the type commonly used for [[divination]] or [[scrying]]]]
The art or process of "seeing" is known as "[[scrying]]", whereby images are claimed to be seen in crystals, or other media such as water, and are interpreted as meaningful information. The "information" gleaned then is used to make important decisions in one's life (i.e. love, marriage, finances, travel, business, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Chauran, Alexandra. Crystal Ball Reading for Beginners: A Down To Earth Guide. Woodbury, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the technique of scrying is used with crystals, or any transparent body, it is known as crystallomancy or [[crystal gazing]].

==In stage magic==
Crystal balls are popular props used in [[mentalism]] acts by [[magic (illusion)|stage magicians]]. Such routines, in which the performer answers audience questions by means of various ruses, are known as crystal gazing acts. One of the most famous performers of the 20th century, [[Alexander (magician)|Claude Alexander]], was often billed as "Alexander the Crystal Seer".

==Properties==
A crystal ball is essentially a bi-convex [[spherical lens]] with a uniform [[radius of curvature]], although without its edges and center material truncated as in a conventional lens construction.  Thus the principles of [[optics]] may be applied to analyze its imaging characteristics.

As a lens, a transparent sphere of any material with [[refractive index]] greater than one bends rays of light to a [[focus (optics)|focal point]].  An image is formed with significant [[coma (optics)|coma]], [[field curvature]], and other [[optical aberrations]] inherent to spherical lenses. The refractive index of typical materials used for crystal balls (quartz: 1.46, window glass: 1.52), produces a central focal point just outside the surface of the sphere, on the side diametrically opposite to where the rays entered.

For materials with refractive index greater than 2, the focus will be located inside the sphere.  In this case the image is not directly accessible, while the closest accessible point is on its surface directly opposite the source of light. However, [[List of refractive indices|few materials]] have a refractive index this high. For a refractive index of 2, the image forms on the surface of the sphere, and the image may be viewed on an translucent object or diffusing coating on the imaging side of the sphere.

Since a crystal ball has no edges like a conventional lens, the image-forming properties are omnidirectional (independent of the direction being imaged). This effect is exploited in the [[Campbell–Stokes recorder]], a scientific instrument which records the brightness of sunlight by burning the surface of a paper card bent around the sphere.  The device, itself fixed, records the apparent motion and intensity of the sun across the sky, burning an image of the sun's motion across the card.

The omnidirectional [[burning glass]] effect can occur with a crystal ball that is brought into full sunlight.  The image of the sun formed by a large crystal ball will burn a hand that is holding it, and can ignite dark-coloured flammable material placed near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61176-2004Jan29.html|title=Crystal Ball Starts Fire at Okla. Home|last=Associated Press|date=29 January 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball lens]]es such as are used to couple [[fiber optics]] are identical to crystal balls, but in tiny form, commonly 1mm to 10mm in diameter.

==Famous crystal balls in history==
A crystal ball lies in the [[Honours of Scotland|Sceptre of Scotland]] that is said to have been originally possessed by pagan druids.&lt;ref name="Ferguson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sibyl Ferguson|title=Crystal Ball: Stones, Amulets, And Talismans For Power, Protection, and Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V0x3_K98_wC&amp;pg=PA59|date=30 June 2005|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=978-1-57863-348-7|pages=59–60, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philadelphia]]'s [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] (also called ''Penn Museum'' for short) displays the third largest crystal ball&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/335728|title=Crystal Sphere|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the central object in its [[Chinese art|Chinese]] [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]].

The ornamental treasure was purportedly made for the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] (1835-1908) during the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 19th century, but no evidence as to its actual origins exists.

There's an audio game built into the [[Google Assistant]] on which tells the player to "Ask a Yes or No Question". The voice starts with an intro that says this line in a dramatic voice: "Come closer. Closer. Closer. Ok Stop. Close your eyes and open your mind. The Crystal Ball shall reveal the truth. Now ask a Yes or No Question." Then after the user asks a question, the voice responds with "The all knowing Crystal Ball says." and then gives a random answer. Also, if you ask it to play the [[Magic 8-ball]] the voice will say "Sorry, I don't have one of those. Instead I have a Crystal Ball." and opens the Crystal Ball game. The game also mentions about [[velvet]] [[curtains]] too.&lt;ref name="cball"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ravenscraft |first1=Eric |title=The Best Games and Easter Eggs on Google Assistant |website=How-To Geek |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Butatriene-3D-balls.png|thumb|1,2,3-Butatriene, the simplest cumulene]]


A '''cumulene''' is a [[hydrocarbon]] with three or more ''cumulative'' (consecutive) [[double bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=cumulenes| file = C01440}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are analogous to [[allene]]s, only having a more extensive chain. The simplest molecule in this class is '''butatriene''' (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C=C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is also called simply ''cumulene''. Unlike most [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s, cumulenes tend to be rigid, comparable to [[alkynes]], which makes them appealing for [[molecular nanotechnology]]. [[Polyyne]]s are another kind of rigid carbon chains.  Cumulenes are found in regions of outer space where hydrogen is rare (see [[astrochemistry]]). Cumulenes containing heteroatoms are called [[heterocumulene]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=heterocumulenes| file = H02797}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example is [[carbon suboxide]].

==Synthesis==
The first reported synthesis of a butatriene is that of tetraphenylbutatriene in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=K.|title=Über Untersuchungen in der Tetraarylbutan-Reihe und über das 1.1 4.4-Tetraphenyl-butatrien. (4. Mitteilung über die Reduktion organischer Halogen-verbindungen.)|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series)|date=17 September 1921|volume=54|issue=8|pages=1987–2006|doi=10.1002/cber.19210540828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common synthetic method for butatriene synthesis is based on [[reductive coupling]] of a [[geminal]] [[dihalo]][[vinylidene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leroyer|first1=Léo|last2=Maraval|first2=Valérie|last3=Chauvin|first3=Remi|title=Synthesis of the Butatriene C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Function: Methodology and Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=112|issue=3|year=2012|pages=1310–1343|issn=0009-2665|doi=10.1021/cr200239h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tetraphenylbutatriene was reported synthesized in 1977 by homocoupling of 2,2-diphenyl-1,1,1-tribromoethane with elemental [[copper]] in [[dimethylformamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunieda|first1=Takehisa|last2=Takizawa|first2=Takeo|title=Convenient preparation of tetraarylbutatrienes|journal=Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin|date=1977|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1809–1810|doi=10.1248/cpb.25.1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Isomerism Cumulenes V.1.png|thumb|''Cis''–''trans'' isomerism of a triene vs axial chirality of an allene]]
The rigidity of cumulenes arises from the fact that the internal carbon atoms carry two double bonds. Their sp hybridisation results in two [[pi bond|π bonds]], one to each neighbor, which are perpendicular to each other. This bonding reinforces a [[Linear molecular geometry|linear geometry]] of the carbon chain.

Cumulenes with non-equivalent substituents on each end exhibit [[isomerism]]. If the number of consecutive double bonds is odd, there is [[cis–trans isomerism|''cis''–''trans'' isomerism]] as for alkenes. If the number of consecutive double bonds is even, there is [[axial chirality]] as for allenes.

==Reactivity==
{{uncited section|date=June 2017}}
The reactions of cumulene are those of simple isolated double bonds because the consecutive double bonds are not [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] to each other.

==Transition metal cumulenes==
The first reported [[Coordination complex|complex]] containing a vinylidene ligand was (Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, derived from the reaction of [[diphenylketene]] and [[Iron pentacarbonyl|Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]  Structurally, this molecule resembles [[Diiron nonacarbonyl|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], wherein one ''μ''-CO ligand is replaced by 1,1-diphenylvinylidene, Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first monometallic vinylidene complex was ([[cyclopentadienyl|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]])Mo([[triphenylphosphine|P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[C=C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=R.

'''Directoire style''', {{IPA-fr|di.ʁɛk.twaʁ}}, describes a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design, concurrent with the post-Revolution [[French Directory]] (November 2, 1795 through November 10, 1799). The style uses [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between [[Louis XVI style|Louis XVI]] and [[Empire style|Empire]].

The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers [[Charles Percier]] (1764–1838) and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pier François Léonard Fontaine]] (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate [[Empire style]], which was introduced after [[Napoleon]] established the [[First French Empire]].

The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of [[Roman Republic|republican Rome]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David.... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11974">'''Dual-coding theory''', a theory of cognition, was hypothesized by [[Allan Paivio]] of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. In developing this theory, Paivio used the idea that the formation of mental images [[picture superiority effect|aids]] in learning (Reed, 2010). According to Paivio, there are two ways a person could expand on learned material: verbal associations and visual imagery. Dual-coding theory postulates that both visual and verbal information is used to represent information (Sternberg, 2003). Visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels in the human mind, creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. The mental codes corresponding to these representations are used to organize incoming information that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use. Both visual and verbal codes can be used when recalling information (Sternberg, 2003). For example, say a person has stored the stimulus concept "dog" as both the word 'dog' and as the image of a dog. When asked to recall the stimulus, the person can retrieve either the word or the image individually, or both simultaneously. If the word is recalled, the image of the dog is not lost and can still be retrieved at a later point in time. The ability to code a stimulus two different ways increases the chance of remembering that item compared to if the stimulus was only coded one way.

There has been controversy to the limitations of the dual-coding theory. Dual-coding theory does not take into account the possibility of cognition being mediated by something other than words and images. Not enough research has been done to determine if words and images are the only way we remember items, and the theory would not hold true if another form of codes were discovered (Pylyshyn, 1973). Another limitation of the dual-coding theory is that it is only valid for tests on which people are asked to focus on identifying how concepts are related (Reed, 2010). If associations between a word and an image cannot be formed, it is much harder to remember and recall the word at a later point in time. While this limits the effectiveness of the dual-coding theory, it is still valid over a wide range of circumstances and can be used to improve memory (Reed, 2010).

==Types of codes==

'''Analogue codes''' are used to mentally represent images. Analogue codes retain the main perceptual features of whatever is being represented, so the images we form in our minds are highly similar to the physical stimuli. They are a near-exact representation of the physical stimuli we observe in our environment, such as trees and rivers (Sternberg, 2003).

'''Symbolic codes''' are used to form mental representations of words. They represent something conceptually, and sometimes, arbitrarily, as opposed to perceptually. Similar to the way a watch may represent information in the form of numbers to display the time, symbolic codes represent information in our mind in the form of arbitrary symbols, like words and combinations of words, to represent several ideas. Each symbol (x, y, 1, 2, etc.) can arbitrarily represent something other than itself. For instance, the letter x is often used to represent more than just the concept of an x, the 24th letter of the alphabet. It can be used to represent a variable x in mathematics, or a multiplication symbol in an equation. Concepts like multiplication can be represented symbolically by an "x" because we arbitrarily assign it a deeper concept. Only when we use it to represent this deeper concept does the letter "x" carry this type of meaning.

== Support ==

===Evidence from psychological research===
Many researchers have agreed that only words and images are used in mental representation (Pylyshyn, 1973). Supporting evidence shows that memory for some verbal information is enhanced if a relevant visual is also presented or if the learner can imagine a visual image to go with the verbal information. Likewise, visual information can often be enhanced when paired with relevant verbal information, whether real-world or imagined (Anderson &amp; Bower, 1973). This theory has been applied to the use of multimedia presentations. Because multimedia presentations require both spatial and verbal working memory, individuals dually code information presented and are more likely to recall the information when tested at a later date (Brunye, Taylor, &amp; Rapp, 2008). Moreover, studies that have been conducted on abstract and concrete words have also found that the participants remembered concrete words better than the abstract words (Hargis &amp; Gickling, 1978; Sadoski, 2005; Yui, Ng, &amp; Perera-W.A., 2017). 

Paivio found that participants when shown a rapid sequence of pictures as well as a rapid sequence of words and later asked to recall the words and pictures, in any order, were better at recalling images. Participants, however, more readily recalled the sequential order of the words, rather than the sequence of pictures. These results supported Paivio's hypothesis that verbal information is processed differently from visual information and that verbal information was superior to visual information when sequential order was also required for the memory task (Paivio, 1969). Lee Brooks conducted an experiment that provided additional support for two systems for memory. He had participants perform either a visual task, where they had to view a picture and answer questions about the picture, or a verbal task, where they listened to a sentence and were then asked to answer questions pertaining to the sentence. To respond to the questions, participants were asked to either respond verbally, visually, or manually. Through this experiment, Brooks found that interference occurred when a visual perception was mixed with manipulation of the visual task, and verbal responses interfere with a task involving a verbal statement to be manually manipulated. This supported the idea of two codes used to mentally represent information (Sternberg 2003).

[[Working memory]] as proposed by [[Alan Baddeley]] includes a two-part processing system with a visuospatial sketchpad and a phonological loop which essentially maps to Paivio's theory.

Dual-coding theories complement a dual-route theory of [[Reading (activity)|reading]]. When people read written information, dual-route theory contends that the readers access [[Orthography|orthographic]] and [[Phonology|phonological]] information to recognize [[Word (linguistics)|words]] in the [[writing]].

Paivio's work has implications for literacy, visual [[mnemonics]], idea generation, [[Human Performance Technology|HPT]], human factors, interface design, as well as the development of educational materials among others. It also has implications for, and counterparts in, [[cognitive sciences]] and computational cognitive modeling (in the form of dual process cognitive models and so on; e.g., Anderson, 2005; Just et al., 2004, Sun, 2002). It also has had implications for cognitive robotics.

===Cognitive neuroscience support===

Two different methods have been used to identify the regions involved in visual perception and visual imagery. First, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is used to measure [[cerebral blood flow]], which allows researchers to identify the amount of glucose and oxygen being consumed by a specific part of the brain, with an increase in blood flow providing a measure of brain activity. Second, an [[event related potential]] (ERP) can be used to show the amount of electrical brain activity that is occurring due to a particular stimulus. Researchers have used both methods to determine which areas of the brain are active with different stimuli, and results have supported the dual-coding theory. Other research has been done with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans and fMRI to show that participants had improved memory for spoken words and sentences when paired with an image, imagined or real, and showed increased brain activation to process abstract words not easily paired with an image.

==Alternative theory==

Dual-coding theory is not accepted by everyone. [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] and [[Gordon H. Bower|Gordon Bower]] proposed an alternative method – the propositional theory – of how knowledge is mentally represented. The propositional theory claims that mental representations are stored as propositions rather than as images. Here, proposition is defined as the meaning that underlies the relationship between concepts (Sternberg, 2003). This theory states that images occur as a result of other cognitive processes because knowledge is not represented in the form of images, words, or symbols.

The [[common coding theory]] has also been proposed as an alternative to dual coding theory. The common coding theory looks at how things we see and hear are connected to our motor actions. It claims that there is a common code that is shared between perceiving something and the respective motor action.

The '''Encyclopedia of DNA Elements''' ('''ENCODE''') is a public research project which aims to identify functional elements in the [[human genome]].

Encode was launched by the US [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI) in September 2003.&lt;ref name="Raney2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raney BJ, Cline MS, Rosenbloom KR, Dreszer TR, Learned K, Barber GP, Meyer LR, Sloan CA, Malladi VS, Roskin KM, Suh BB, Hinrichs AS, Clawson H, Zweig AS, Kirkup V, Fujita PA, Rhead B, Smith KE, Pohl A, Kuhn RM, Karolchik D, Haussler D, Kent WJ | title = ENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC genome browser (2011 update) | journal = [[Nucleic Acids Research|Nucleic Acids Res.]] | volume = 39 | issue = Database issue | pages = D871–5 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21037257 | pmc = 3013645 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq1017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlThe ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5696/636.full?ijkey=B97GTMHPpxEc2&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci | title = The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project  | author = The ENCODE Project Consortium | year = 2004 | publisher = Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | editor = [[Peter Becker (biologist)|Becker PB]]| author = ENCODE Project Consortium| title = A User's Guide to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001046 | journal = [[PLOS Biology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = e1001046 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21526222| pmc = 3079585}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birney"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended as a follow-up to the [[Human Genome Project]], the ENCODE project aims to identify all functional elements in the [[human genome]].

The project involves a worldwide consortium of research groups, and data generated from this project can be accessed through public databases. The project is beginning its fourth phase as of February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10005107/the-encode-project-encyclopedia-of-dna-elements/|title=The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation and Significance ==

Humans are estimated to have approximately 20,000 protein-coding [[gene]]s, which account for about 1.5% of DNA in the human genome. The primary goal of the ENCODE project is to determine the role of the remaining component of the genome, much of which was traditionally regarded as "junk." The activity and expression of protein-coding genes can be modulated by the [[regulome]] - a variety of [[DNA]] elements, such as the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]], transcriptional regulatory sequences, and regions of [[chromatin]] structure and [[histone]] modification. It is thought that changes in the regulation of [[gene]] activity can disrupt [[protein]] production and [[Cell (biology)|cell]] processes and result in disease. Determining the location of these regulatory elements and how they influence gene transcription could reveal links between variations in the [[Gene expression|expression]] of certain [[gene]]s and the development of disease.&lt;ref name="SN182#7"&gt;{{cite web | last = Saey | first = Tina Hesman | title = Team releases sequel to the human genome | url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/343850/title/Team_releases_sequel_to_the_human_genome | publisher = Society for Science &amp; the Public | date = 6 October 2012 | accessdate = 18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ENCODE is also intended as a comprehensive resource to allow the scientific community to better understand how the [[genome]] can affect human health, and to "stimulate the development of new therapies to prevent and treat these diseases".&lt;ref name="urlThe ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5696/636.full?ijkey=B97GTMHPpxEc2&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci | title = The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project  | author = The ENCODE Project Consortium | year = 2004 | publisher = Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ENCODE Consortium==

The ENCODE Consortium is composed primarily of scientists who were funded by US [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI). Other participants contributing to the project are brought up into the Consortium or Analysis Working Group.

The pilot phase consisted of eight research groups and twelve groups participating in the ENCODE Technology Development Phase. After 2007, the number of participants grew up to 440 scientists from 32 laboratories worldwide as the pilot phase was officially over. At the moment the consortium consists of different centers which perform different tasks.

ENCODE is a member of the [[International Human Epigenome Consortium]] (IHEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ihec-epigenomes.org/about/ihec-countries/us/|title=United States of America · IHEC|last=GmbH|first=Eurice|website=ihec-epigenomes.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ENCODE Project ==

ENCODE is currently implemented in four phases: the pilot phase and the technology development phase, which were initiated simultaneously;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10005107/encode-project/#al-10|title=ENCODE Project|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the production phase. The fourth phase is a continuation of the third, and includes functional characterization and further integrative analysis for the encyclopedia.

The goal of the pilot phase was to identify a set of procedures that, in combination, could be applied cost-effectively and at high-throughput to accurately and comprehensively characterize large regions of the [[human genome]]. The pilot phase had to reveal gaps in the current set of tools for detecting functional sequences, and was also thought to reveal whether some methods used by that time were inefficient or unsuitable for large-scale utilization. Some of these problems had to be addressed in the ENCODE technology development phase, which aimed to devise new laboratory and computational methods that would improve our ability to identify known functional sequences or to discover new functional genomic elements. The results of the first two phases determined the best path forward for analyzing the remaining 99% of the human genome in a cost-effective and comprehensive production phase.&lt;ref name="urlThe ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5696/636.full?ijkey=B97GTMHPpxEc2&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci | title = The ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) Project  | author = The ENCODE Project Consortium | year = 2004 | publisher = Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ENCODE Phase I Project: The Pilot Project ===

The pilot phase tested and compared existing methods to rigorously analyze a defined portion of the human genome sequence. It was organized as an open consortium and brought together investigators with diverse backgrounds and expertise to evaluate the relative merits of each of a diverse set of techniques, technologies and strategies. The concurrent technology development phase of the project aimed to develop new high throughput methods to identify functional elements. The goal of these efforts was to identify a suite of approaches that would allow the comprehensive identification of all the functional elements in the human genome. Through the ENCODE pilot project, [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI) assessed the abilities of different approaches to be scaled up for an effort to analyse the entire human genome and to find gaps in the ability to identify functional elements in genomic sequence.

The ENCODE pilot project process involved close interactions between computational and experimental scientists to evaluate a number of methods for annotating the human genome. A set of regions representing approximately 1% (30 Mb) of the human genome was selected as the target for the pilot project and was analyzed by all ENCODE pilot project investigators. All data generated by ENCODE participants on these regions was rapidly released into public databases.&lt;ref name="birney"&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Target Selection ====

For use in the ENCODE pilot project, defined regions of the human genome - corresponding to 30Mb, roughly 1% of the total human genome - were selected. These regions served as the foundation on which to test and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a diverse set of methods and technologies for finding various functional elements in human DNA.

Prior to embarking upon the target selection, it was decided that 50% of the 30Mb of sequence would be selected manually while the remaining sequence would be selected randomly. The two main criteria for manually selected regions were: 1) the presence of well-studied [[gene]]s or other known sequence elements, and 2) the existence of a substantial amount of comparative sequence data. A total of 14.82Mb of sequence was manually selected using this approach, consisting of 14 targets that range in size from 500kb to 2Mb.

The remaining 50% of the 30Mb of sequence were composed of thirty, 500kb regions selected according to a stratified random-sampling strategy based on gene density and level of non-exonic conservation. The decision to use these particular criteria was made in order to ensure a good sampling of genomic regions varying widely in their content of [[gene]]s and other functional elements. The human genome was divided into three parts - top 20%, middle 30%, and bottom 50% - along each of two axes: 1) [[gene]] density and 2) level of non-[[exon]]ic conservation with respect to the [[orthologous]] mouse genomic sequence (see below), for a total of nine strata. From each stratum, three random regions were chosen for the pilot project. For those strata underrepresented by the manual picks, a fourth region was chosen, resulting in a total of 30 regions. For all strata, a "backup" region was designated for use in the event of unforeseen technical problems.

In greater detail, the stratification criteria were as follows:
* [[Gene]] density: The [[gene]] density score of a region was the percentage of bases covered either by genes in the [[Ensembl]] database, or by human [[mRNA]] best [[BLAT (bioinformatics)|BLAT]] ([[BLAST]]-like alignment tool) alignments in the [[UCSC Genome Browser]] database.
* Non-[[exon]]ic conservation: The region was divided into non-overlapping subwindows of 125 bases. Subwindows that showed less than 75% base alignment with mouse sequence were discarded. For the remaining subwindows, the percentage with at least 80% base identity to mouse, and which did not correspond to [[Ensembl]] genes, [[GenBank]] [[mRNA]] BLASTZ alignments, Fgenesh++ gene predictions, TwinScan gene predictions, spliced EST alignments, or repeated sequences ([[DNA]]), was used as the non-exonic conservation score.

The above scores were computed within non-overlapping 500 kb windows of finished sequence across the genome, and used to assign each window to a stratum.&lt;ref name="urlENCODE: Pilot Project: Target Selection"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genome.gov/10506161 | title = ENCODE: Pilot Project: Target Selection | author = ENCODE Program Staff | date = 2012-02-19 | publisher = National Human Genome Research Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pilot Phase Results ====

The pilot phase was successfully finished and the results were published in June 2007 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref name="birney"/&gt; and in a special issue of ''[[Genome Research]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author =Weinstock GM | title = ENCODE: More genomic empowerment | doi = 10.1101/gr.6534207 | journal = Genome Research | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 667–668 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17567987| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the results published in the first paper mentioned advanced the collective knowledge about [[human genome]] function in several major areas, included in the following highlights:&lt;ref name="birney"/&gt;
* The human genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its [[Base pair|bases]] are associated with at least one [[primary transcript]] and many transcripts link distal regions to established protein-coding [[Locus (genetics)|loci]].
* Many novel non-protein-coding transcripts have been identified, with many of these overlapping protein-coding [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] and others located in regions of the [[genome]] previously thought to be transcriptionally silent.
* Numerous previously unrecognized [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start sites have been identified, many of which show [[chromatin]] structure and sequence-specific protein-binding properties similar to well-understood [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]].
* Regulatory sequences that surround transcription start sites are symmetrically distributed, with no bias towards upstream regions.
* [[Chromatin]] accessibility and [[histone]] modification patterns are highly predictive of both the presence and activity of transcription start sites.
* Distal [[Deoxyribonuclease I|DNaseI]] hypersensitive sites have characteristic [[histone]] modification patterns that reliably distinguish them from [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]]; some of these distal sites show marks consistent with insulator function.
* [[DNA replication]] timing is correlated with chromatin structure.
* A total of 5% of the bases in the [[genome]] can be confidently identified as being under evolutionary constraint in mammals; for approximately 60% of these constrained bases, there is evidence of function on the basis of the results of the experimental assays performed to date.
* Although there is general overlap between genomic regions identified as functional by experimental assays and those under evolutionary constraint, not all bases within these experimentally defined regions show evidence of constraint.
* Different functional elements vary greatly in their sequence variability across the human population and in their likelihood of residing within a structurally variable region of the [[genome]].
* Surprisingly, many functional elements are seemingly unconstrained across mammalian evolution. This suggests the possibility of a large pool of neutral elements that are biochemically active but provide no specific benefit to the organism. This pool may serve as a 'warehouse' for natural selection, potentially acting as the source of lineage-specific elements and functionally conserved but non-orthologous elements between species.

[[File:EncodeSample.png|thumb|right|Image of ENCODE data in the [[UCSC Genome Browser]]. This shows several tracks containing information on [[gene regulation]]. The gene on the left (ATP2B4) is transcribed in a wide variety of cells. The gene on the right is only transcribed in a few types of cells, including embryonic stem cells.]]

In September 2007, [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI) began funding the production phase of the ENCODE project. In this phase, the goal was to analyze the entire genome and to conduct "additional pilot-scale studies".&lt;ref name="urlGenome.gov | ENCODE and modENCODE Projects"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genome.gov/10005107 | title = Genome.gov &amp;#124; ENCODE and modENCODE Projects | date = 2011-08-01 | work = The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements | publisher = United States National Human Genome Research Institute | accessdate = 2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the pilot project, the production effort is organized as an open consortium. In October 2007, NHGRI awarded grants totaling more than $80 million over four years.&lt;ref name="NIHalmanac"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Human Genome Research Institute - Organization |date= |work=The NIH Almanac |publisher=United States National Institutes of Health |url=http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NHGRI.htm |accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production phase also includes a Data Coordination Center, a Data Analysis Center, and a Technology Development Effort.&lt;ref name="urlGenome.gov | ENCODE Participants and Projects"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genome.gov/26525220 | title = Genome.gov &amp;#124; ENCODE Participants and Projects | date = 2011-08-01 | work = The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements | publisher = United States National Human Genome Research Institute | accessdate = 2011-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time the project evolved into a truly global enterprise, involving 440 scientists from 32 laboratories worldwide.  Once the pilot phase was completed, the project “scaled up” in 2007, profiting immensely from new-generation sequencing machines.  And the data was, indeed, big; researchers generated around 15 terabytes of raw data.

By 2010, over 1,000 genome-wide data sets had been produced by the ENCODE project. Taken together, these data sets show which regions are transcribed into RNA, which regions are likely to control the genes that are used in a particular type of cell, and which regions are associated with a wide variety of proteins. The primary assays used in ENCODE are [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|ChIP-seq]], [[DNase I]] Hypersensitivity, [[RNA-seq]], and assays of [[DNA methylation]].

==== Production Phase Results ====

In September 2012, the project released a much more extensive set of results, in 30 papers published simultaneously in several journals, including six in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', six in  ''[[Genome Biology]]'' and a special issue with 18 publications of ''[[Genome Research]]''.&lt;ref name=NatureGuide&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ecker JR, Bickmore WA, Barroso I, Pritchard JK, Gilad Y, Segal E | title = Genomics: ENCODE explained | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7414 | pages = 52–5 |date=September 2012 | pmid = 22955614 | doi = 10.1038/489052a |bibcode = 2012Natur.489...52E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors described the production and the initial analysis of 1,640 data sets designed to annotate functional elements in the entire human genome, integrating results from diverse experiments within cell types, related experiments involving 147 different cell types, and all ENCODE data with other resources, such as candidate regions from genome-wide association studies ([[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]]) and evolutionary [[Biological constraints|constrained]] regions. Together, these efforts revealed important features about the organization and function of the human genome, which were summarized in an overview paper as follows:&lt;ref name="pmid22955616"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 2012|title=An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome|journal=Nature|volume=489|issue=7414|pages=57–74|bibcode=2012Natur.489...57T|doi=10.1038/nature11247|pmc=3439153|pmid=22955616|vauthors=Bernstein BE, Birney E, Dunham I, Green ED, Gunter C, Snyder M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at least one biochemical [[RNA]] and/or [[chromatin]] associated event in at least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event: 95% of the genome lies within 8kb of a [[DNA]]-[[protein]] interaction (as assayed by bound [[ChiP-sequencing|ChIP-seq]] motifs or [[Deoxyribonuclease I|DNaseI]] [[DNA footprinting|footprints]]), and 99% is within 1.7kb of at least one of the biochemical events measured by ENCODE.
# Primate-specific elements as well as elements without detectable mammalian constraint show, in aggregate, evidence of negative selection; thus some of them are expected to be functional. 
# Classifying the [[genome]] into seven [[chromatin]] states suggests an initial set of 399,124 regions with [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]]-like features and 70,292 regions with [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]]-like features, as well hundreds of thousands of quiescent regions. High-resolution analyses further subdivide the [[genome]] into thousands of narrow states with distinct functional properties.
# It is possible to quantitatively correlate [[RNA]] sequence production and processing with both [[chromatin]] marks and [[transcription factor]] (TF) binding at [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], indicating that promoter functionality can explain the majority of RNA expression variation.
# Many [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding]] variants in individual [[genome]] sequences lie in ENCODE- annotated functional regions; this number is at least as large as those that lie in protein coding genes.
# [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] associated with disease by [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] are enriched within non-coding functional elements, with a majority residing in or near ENCODE-defined regions that are outside of [[protein]] coding [[gene]]s. In many cases, the disease [[phenotype]]s can be associated with a specific cell type or [[transcription factor|TF]].

The most striking finding was that the fraction of human DNA that is biologically active is considerably higher than even the most optimistic previous estimates.  In an overview paper, the ENCODE Consortium reported that its members were able to assign biochemical functions to over 80% of the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid22955616"/&gt; Much of this was found to be involved in controlling the expression levels of [[Coding region|coding DNA]], which makes up less than 1% of the genome.

The most important new elements of the "encyclopedia" include:

*A comprehensive map of DNase 1 hypersensitive sites, which are markers for regulatory DNA that is typically located adjacent to genes and allows chemical factors to influence their expression. The map identified nearly 3 million sites of this type, including nearly all that were previously known and many that are novel.&lt;ref name="pmid22955617"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thurman RE, Rynes E, Humbert R, Vierstra J, Maurano MT, Haugen E, Sheffield NC, Stergachis AB, Wang H | title = The accessible chromatin landscape of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7414 | pages = 75–82 |date=September 2012 | pmid = 22955617 | doi = 10.1038/nature11232 |bibcode = 2012Natur.489...75T | pmc=3721348|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A lexicon of short DNA sequences that form recognition motifs for DNA-binding proteins. Approximately 8.4 million such sequences were found, comprising a fraction of the total DNA roughly twice the size of the [[exome]]. Thousands of transcription promoters were found to make use of a single stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint.&lt;ref name="pmid22955618"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neph S, Vierstra J, Stergachis AB, Reynolds AP, Haugen E, Vernot B, Thurman RE, John S, Sandstrom R | title = An expansive human regulatory lexicon encoded in transcription factor footprints | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7414 | pages = 83–90 |date=September 2012 | pmid = 22955618 | doi = 10.1038/nature11212 |bibcode = 2012Natur.489...83N |display-authors=etal|pmc=3736582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A preliminary sketch of the architecture of the network of human transcription factors, that is, factors that bind to DNA in order to promote or inhibit the expression of genes.

*A measurement of the fraction of the human genome that is capable of being transcribed into RNA.

=== Data Management and Analysis ===

Capturing, storing, integrating, and displaying the diverse data generated is challenging. The ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC) organizes and displays the data generated by the labs in the consortium, and ensures that the data meets specific quality standards when it is released to the public. Before a lab submits any data, the DCC and the lab draft a data agreement that defines the experimental parameters and associated metadata. The DCC validates incoming data to ensure consistency with the agreement. It also ensures that all data is annotated using appropriate [[Ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=25776021 | doi=10.1093/database/bav010 | volume=2015 | title=Ontology application and use at the ENCODE DCC | pmc=4360730 | journal=Database (Oxford) | vauthors=Malladi VS, Erickson DT, Podduturi NR, Rowe LD, Chan ET, Davidson JM, Hitz BC, Ho M, Lee BT, Miyasato S, Roe GR, Simison M, Sloan CA, Strattan JS, Tanaka F, Kent WJ, Cherry JM, Hong EL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then loads the data onto a test server for preliminary inspection, and coordinates with the labs to organize the data into a consistent set of tracks. When the tracks are ready, the DCC Quality Assurance team performs a series of integrity checks, verifies that the data is presented in a manner consistent with other browser data, and perhaps most importantly, verifies that the metadata and accompanying descriptive text are presented in a way that is useful to our users. The data is released on the public [[UCSC Genome Browser]] website only after all of these checks have been satisfied. In parallel, data is analyzed by the ENCODE Data Analysis Center, a consortium of analysis teams from the various production labs plus other researchers. These teams develop standardized protocols to analyze data from novel assays, determine best practices, and produce a consistent set of analytic methods such as standardized [[Peak calling|peak callers]] and signal generation from alignment [[Pileup format|pile-ups]].&lt;ref name="urlENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC genome browser (2011 update)"&gt;{{cite journal | title = ENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC genome browser (2011 update) | author = Brian J.

The [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] (NHGRI) has identified ENCODE as a "community resource project". This important concept was defined at an international meeting held in Ft. Lauderdale in January 2003 as a research project specifically devised and implemented to create a set of data, reagents, or other material whose primary utility will be as a resource for the broad scientific community. Accordingly, the ENCODE data release policy stipulates that data, once verified, will be deposited into public databases and made available for all to use without restriction.&lt;ref name="urlENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC genome browser (2011 update)"&gt;{{cite journal | title = ENCODE whole-genome data in the UCSC genome browser (2011 update) | author = Brian J.

==Other Projects==
With the continuation of the third phase, the ENCODE Consortium has become involved with additional projects whose goals run parallel to the ENCODE project. Some of these projects were part of the second phase of ENCODE.

===modENCODE project===

The MODel organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (modENCODE) project is a continuation of the original ENCODE project targeting the identification of functional elements in selected [[model organism]] genomes, specifically ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.&lt;ref name=modencode_NHGRI&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genome.gov/26524507 | title=The modENCODE Project: Model Organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (modENCODE) | work=[[NHGRI]] website | accessdate=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension to model organisms permits biological validation of the computational and experimental findings of the ENCODE project, something that is difficult or impossible to do in humans.&lt;ref name=modencode_NHGRI/&gt; Funding for the modENCODE project was announced by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in 2007 and included several different research institutions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.genome.gov/26524648 | title=modENCODE Participants and Projects | work=[[NHGRI]] website | accessdate=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/LSD-modENCODE.html | title=Berkeley Lab Life Sciences Awarded NIH Grants for Fruit Fly, Nematode Studies | work=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] website | date=2007-05-14 | accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project completed its work in 2012.

In late 2010, the modENCODE consortium unveiled its first set of results with publications on annotation and integrative analysis of the worm and fly genomes in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Gerstein MB, Lu ZJ, Van Nostrand EL, Cheng C, Arshinoff BI, Liu T, Yip KY, Robilotto R, Rechtsteiner A| doi = 10.1126/science.1196914 | title = Integrative Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans Genome by the modENCODE Project | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6012 | pages = 1775–1787 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21177976| pmc = 3142569|bibcode = 2010Sci...330.1775G |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = ((modENCODE Consortium)), Roy S, Ernst J, Kharchenko PV, Kheradpour P, Negre N, Eaton ML, Landolin JM, Bristow CA, Ma L| doi = 10.1126/science.1198374 | title = Identification of Functional Elements and Regulatory Circuits by Drosophila modENCODE | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6012 | pages = 1787–1797 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21177974| pmc = 3192495|bibcode = 2010Sci...330.1787R |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from these publications is available from the modENCODE web site.&lt;ref name="urlmodENCODE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.modencode.org | title = modENCODE | publisher = The National Human Genome Research Institute | work = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

modENCODE was run as a Research Network and the consortium was formed by 11 primary projects, divided between worm and fly. The projects spanned the following:
* Gene structure 
* mRNA and ncRNA expression profiling 
* Transcription factor binding sites 
* Histone modifications and replacement 
* Chromatin structure 
* DNA replication initiation and timing 
* Copy number variation.&lt;ref name="urlUnlocking the secrets of the genome"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7249/full/459927a.html | title = Unlocking the secrets of the genome  | author = Celniker S | date = 2009-06-11 | journal = Nature | volume=459 | doi=10.1038/459927a | pages=927–930| bibcode=2009Natur.459..927C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====modERN====
modERN, short for the model organism encyclopedia of regulatory networks, branched from the modENCODE project. The project has merged the C. elegans and Drosophila groups and focuses on the identification of additional transcription factor binding sites of the respective organisms. 
The project began at the same time as Phase III of ENCODE, and plans to end in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=8566279&amp;icde=19088980&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the project has released 198 experiments,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;award.project=modERN&amp;status=released&lt;/ref&gt; with around 500 other experiments submitted and currently being processed by the DCC.

===Genomics of Gene Regulation===
In early 2015, the NIH launched the Genomics of Gene Regulation (GGR) program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genome.gov/27559930/2015-release-nih-grants-aim-to-decipher-the-language-of-gene-regulation/&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the program, which will last for three years, is to study gene networks and pathways in different systems of the body, with the hopes to further understand the mechanisms controlling gene expressions. Although the ENCODE project is separate from GGR, the ENCODE DCC has been hosting GGR data in the ENCODE portal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&amp;award.project=GGR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roadmap===
In 2008, NIH began the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium, whose goal was to produce “a public resource of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology and disease-oriented research”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2015, the consortium released an article titled “Integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes” that fulfilled the consortium’s goal. The consortium integrated information and annotated regulatory elements across 127 reference epigenomes, 16 of which were part of the ENCODE project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7539/full/nature14248.html&lt;/ref&gt; Data for the Roadmap project can either be found in the Roadmap portal or ENCODE portal.

===fruitENCODE project===
The fruitENCODE: an encyclopedia of DNA elements for fruit ripening is a plant ENCODE project that aims to generate DNA methylation, histone modifications, DHS, gene expression, transcription factor binding datasets for all fleshy fruit species at different developmental stages. Prerelease data can be found in the fruitENCODE portal.

== Criticism of the project ==

Although the consortium claims they are far from finished with the ENCODE project, many reactions to the published papers and the news coverage that accompanied the release were favorable. The Nature editors and ENCODE authors "... collaborated over many months to make the biggest splash possible and capture the attention of not only the research community but also of the public at large".&lt;ref name="urlFighting about ENCODE and junk : Nature News Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/09/fighting-about-encode-and-junk.html | title = Fighting about ENCODE and junk  | author =  Maher B | date = 2012-09-06 | work = News Blog | publisher = Nature Publishing Group  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ENCODE project's claim that 80% of the human genome has biochemical function&lt;ref name="pmid22955616"/&gt; was rapidly picked up by the popular press who described the results of the project as leading to the death of [[junk DNA]].&lt;ref name="urlFar From ‘Junk,’ DNA Dark Matter Proves Crucial to Health - NYTimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/science/far-from-junk-dna-dark-matter-proves-crucial-to-health.html?pagewanted=all | title = Far From ‘Junk,’ DNA Dark Matter Proves Crucial to Health | author =  Kolata G | authorlink = Gina Kolata | date = 2012-09-05 | publisher = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlThe ENCODE media hype machine. « Genomicron"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2012/09/the-encode-media-hype-machine/ | title = The ENCODE media hype machine | author = Gregory TR | date = 2012-09-06  | publisher = Genomicron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the conclusion that most of the genome is "functional" has been criticized on the grounds that ENCODE project used a liberal definition of "functional", namely anything that is transcribed must be functional. This conclusion was arrived at despite the widely accepted view, based on genomic conservation estimates from comparative genomics, that many DNA elements such as [[pseudogene]]s that are transcribed are nevertheless non-functional. Furthermore, the ENCODE project has emphasized [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] over [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] leading possibly to the detection of many [[false positive]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid23431001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graur D, Zheng Y, Price N, Azevedo RB, Zufall RA, Elhaik E | title = On the immortality of television sets: "function" in the human genome according to the evolution-free gospel of ENCODE | journal = Genome Biol Evol | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 578–90 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23431001 | pmc = 3622293 | doi = 10.1093/gbe/evt028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlSandwalk: On the Meaning of the Word Function"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/03/on-meaning-of-word-function.html | title = Sandwalk: On the Meaning of the Word "Function" | author = Moran LA  | date = 2013-03-15 | publisher = Sandwalk  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlCritiques of ENCODE in peer-reviewed journals"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/2013/04/critiques-of-encode-in-peer-reviewed-journals/ | title = Critiques of ENCODE in peer-reviewed journals. « Genomicron | author = Gregory TR | date = 2013-04-11 | publisher = Genomicron }}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat arbitrary choice of cell lines and transcription factors as well as lack of appropriate control experiments were additional major criticisms of ENCODE as random DNA mimics ENCODE-like 'functional' behavior.&lt;ref name="pmid23818646"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White MA, Myers CA, Corbo JC, Cohen BA | title = Massively parallel in vivo enhancer assay reveals that highly local features determine the cis-regulatory function of ChIP-seq peaks | journal = Proc.

In response to some of the criticisms, other scientists argued that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of genetic function than genomic conservation estimates because conservation estimates are all relative and difficult to align due to incredible variations in genome sizes of even closely related species, it is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome.&lt;ref name="extent functionality"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattick JS, Dinger ME | title = The extent of functionality in the human genome | journal = The HUGO Journal | date = 2013 | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | page = 2 | doi = 10.1186/1877-6566-7-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kellis et al ENCODE" /&gt; Conservation estimates may be used to provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome.&lt;ref name="kellis et al ENCODE" /&gt; Furthermore, much of the genome that is being disputed by critics seems to be involved in [[epigenetic]] regulation such as gene expression and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms.&lt;ref name="extent functionality" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nessa&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Nessa|title=Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome|date=2015|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231170840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ENCODE results were not necessarily unexpected since increases in attributions of functionality were foreshadowed by previous decades of research.&lt;ref name="extent functionality" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nessa /&gt; Additionally, others have noted that the ENCODE project from the very beginning had a scope that was based on seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome not evolutionary functional elements, which are not necessarily the same thing since evolutionary selection is neither sufficient nor necessary to establish a function. It is a very useful proxy to relevant functions, but an imperfect one and not the only one.&lt;ref name="Germain Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Germain|first1=Pierre-Luc|last2=Ratti|first2=Emanuele|last3=Boem|first3=Federico|title=Junk or Functional DNA?

In response to the complaints about the definition of the word "function" some have noted that ENCODE did define what it meant and since the scope of ENCODE was seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome, then the conclusion of the project should be interpreted ''"as saying that 80 % of the genome is engaging in relevant biochemical activities that are very likely to have causal roles in phenomena deemed relevant to biomedical research."'' &lt;ref name="Germain Function" /&gt;  The issue of function is more about definitional differences than about the strength of the project, which was in providing data for further research on biochemical activity of non-protein coding parts of DNA. Though definitions are important and science is bounded by the limits of language, it seems that ENCODE has been well received for its purpose since there are now more research papers using ENCODE data than there are papers arguing over the definition of function, as of March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nature Editorial|title=Form and function|journal=Nature|date=March 14, 2013|volume=495|pages=141–142|doi=10.1038/495141b|url=http://www.nature.com/news/form-and-function-1.12580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ewan Birney, one of the ENCODE researchers, commented that "function" was used pragmatically to mean "specific biochemical activity" which included different classes of assays: RNA, "broad" histone modifications, "narrow" histone modifications, DNaseI hypersensitive sites, Transcription Factor ChIP-seq peaks, DNaseI Footprints, Transcription Factor bound motifs, and Exons.&lt;ref name=Ewan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birney|first1=Ewan|title=ENCODE: My own thoughts|url=http://genomeinformatician.blogspot.com/2012/09/encode-my-own-thoughts.html|website=Ewan's Blog: Bioinformatician at large|date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ENCODE researchers noted that in the literature, functional parts of the genome have been identified differently in previous studies depending on the approaches used. There have been three general approaches used to identify functional parts of the human genome: genetic approaches (which rely on changes in phenotype), evolutionary approaches (which rely on conservation) and biochemical approaches (which rely on biochemical testing and was used by ENCODE). All three have limitations: genetic approaches may miss functional elements that do not manifest physically on the organism, evolutionary approaches have difficulties using accurate multispecies sequence alignments since genomes of even closely related species vary considerably, and with biochemical approaches, though having high reproducibility, the biochemical signatures do not always automatically signify a function. They concluded that in contrast to evolutionary and genetic evidence, biochemical data offer clues about both the molecular function served by underlying DNA elements and the cell types in which they act and ultimately all three approaches can be used in a complementary way to identify regions that may be functional in human biology and disease. Furthermore, they noted that the biochemical maps provided by ENCODE were the most valuable things from the project since they provide a starting point for testing how these signatures relate to molecular, cellular, and organismal function.&lt;ref name="kellis et al ENCODE"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kellis M, Wold B, Snyder MP, Bernstein BE, Kundaje A, Marinov GK, Ward LD, Birney E, Crawford GE, Dekker J, Dunham I, Elnitski LL, Farnham PJ, Feingold EA, Gerstein M, Giddings MC, Gilbert DM, Gingeras TR, Green ED, Guigo R, Hubbard T, Kent J, Lieb JD, Myers RM, Pazin MJ, Ren B, Stamatoyannopoulos JA, Weng Z, White KP, Hardison RC| displayauthors = 1 |title=Defining functional DNA elements in the human genome |journal=Proc.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has also been criticized for its high cost (~$400 million in total) and favoring big science which takes money away from highly productive investigator-initiated research.&lt;ref name="urlDebating ENCODE: Dan Graur, Michael Eisen"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mendelspod.com/podcast/debating-encode-with-dan-graur-and-michael-eisen#sthash.677QkEuH.hmZBwMqp.dpbs | title = Debating ENCODE: Dan Graur, Michael Eisen  | author = Timpson T | date = 2013-03-05 | publisher = Mendelspod }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot ENCODE project cost an estimated $55 million; the scale-up was about $130 million and the US [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] NHGRI could award up to $123 million for the next phase. Some researchers argue that a solid return on that investment has yet to be seen. There have been attempts to scour the literature for the papers in which ENCODE plays a significant part and since 2012 there have been 300 papers, 110 of which come from labs without ENCODE funding. An additional problem is that ENCODE is not a unique name dedicated to the ENCODE project exclusively, so the word 'encode' comes up in many genetics and genomics literature.&lt;ref name="Maher_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 2012|title=ENCODE: The human encyclopaedia|journal=Nature|volume=489|issue=7414|pages=46–8|doi=10.1038/489046a|pmid=22962707|author=Maher B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major critique is that the results do not justify the amount of time spent on the project and that the project itself is essentially unfinishable.  Although often compared to [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP) and even termed as the HGP next step, the HGP had a clear endpoint which ENCODE currently lacks.
 
The authors seem to sympathize with the scientific concerns and at the same time try to justify their efforts by giving interviews and explaining ENCODE details not just to the scientific public, but also to mass media. They also claim that it took more than half a century from the realization that [[DNA]] is the hereditary material of life to the human genome sequence, so that their plan for the next century would be to really understand the sequence itself.&lt;ref name = "Maher_2012"/&gt;

== FactorBook ==

The analysis of transcription factor binding data generated by the ENCODE project is currently available in the web-accessible repository FactorBook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factorbook.org/ FactorBook]&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Factorbook.org is a Wiki-based database for transcription factor-binding data generated by the ENCODE consortium. In the first release, Factorbook contains:
* 457 ChIP-seq datasets on 119 TFs in a number of human cell lines 
* The average profiles of histone modifications and nucleosome positioning around the TF-binding regions 
* Sequence motifs enriched in the regions and the distance and orientation preferences between motif sites.&lt;ref name="urlFactorbook.org: a Wiki-based database for transcription factor-binding data generated by the ENCODE consortium"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/D1/D171.long | title = Factorbook.org: a Wiki-based database for transcription factor-binding data generated by the ENCODE consortium  | author = Wang J | date = 2012-11-29 | publisher = Nucleic Acids Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exhibition of cultural heritage objects''' is a practice used by organizations where collected objects are put on display to the public.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The objects are carefully chosen and placed together to offer educational value, and often to tell a story.

Organizations that collect [[cultural heritage]] objects, such as museums, tend to focus on the identification, display and interpretation of what they collect, preserve and study.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institute"&gt;[http://www..si.edu/Content/opanda/docs/Rpts2002/02.10.MakingExhibitions.Final.pdf Smithsonian Institution- Office of Policy and Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations many times will have a mandate to exhibit those objects to the public. The process that is undertaken when an object is chosen to be in an exhibition requires careful analysis of the needs of both the object and the exhibit design. Therefore, exhibitions have created a need for systems and procedures to be in place for processing the objects.

==Collections Management Policy==
A [[Collection Management Policy]], or CMP, is a set of policies that address various aspects of collections management. This policy defines the scope of a museum's collection and how the organization cares for and makes collections available to the public.&lt;ref name="American Alliance of Museums"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/docs/default-source/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=4 American Alliance of Museums]&lt;/ref&gt; Access and use policies for objects in a collection will be explained in the CMP. The documentation of object activity and monitoring will also be laid out in the policy. When an object is chosen for exhibition inclusion, the CMP will give clarity and guidance as to how to proceed. An Exhibition Policy may be included within a CMP giving strategic planning guidelines that allow all participants in the exhibit-making process to know how it fits into the overall exhibit program and organization mission.&lt;ref name="Museum Admin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Genoways|first1=Hugh H.|last2=Ireland|first2=Lynne M.|title=Museum Administration: an Introduction|date=2003|publisher=American Association for State and Local History|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=0-7591-0293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel Involved==
The formalized idea of a team of contributing members designing and developing museum exhibitions has been in practice since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Chicone &amp; Kissel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chicone|first1=Sarah J.|last2=Kissel|first2=Richard A.|title=Dinosaurs and Dioramas: creating natural history exhibitions|date=2014|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-1-61132-275-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the size and nature of the collecting organization, the number of people involved and what duties are assigned, the following responsibilities can vary significantly. 
*[[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]] -  check availability of objects, prepare exhibition file which may include: tracking of objects, loan documents, condition assessments, conservation information, packing and shipping information
*[[Curator]] - may create exhibition concept, subject matter expert, object research
*[[Conservator-restorer|Conservator/Restorer]] - inspect object, prepare treatment proposal, cost estimates for treatment
*[[Exhibition designer]] - designs the space for an exhibition: graphic look and feel, labels, display cases, lighting
*[[Mount maker|Mount Maker]]/Preparator- creation of mounts and display mechanisms for each object to be displayed
[[File:Ornamental gold mounts.jpg|thumb|unique mount for exhibit display]]

==Considerations==
When an object is chosen for exhibit one must have an understanding of the nature of the material, its condition, and the types of deterioration to which the object is susceptible. Collections personnel and registrars work closely with developers and content specialists to select objects at a project’s onset, and then work with production specialists for determining proper conditions for display, such as light levels, humidity concerns and mount making.&lt;ref name="Chicone &amp; Kissel" /&gt; The registrar will research the object's file for any condition history, and a current condition report will be done to make an assessment if the object is capable of withstanding display. Because of exhibition inclusion, the object may be handled, moved, exposed to direct lighting, and experience fluctuations in temperature and humidity. All of these factors are agents of deterioration, making the assessment of the object's condition prior to exhibit very important.

===In-House Exhibition or A Loan===
The exhibition can take place in the same organization that houses the object, at another institution, or many locations as with a traveling exhibition. The process for in-house exhibitions begins in a similar fashion as a loan. An object list is decided upon and the status of each object must be researched for location and condition. The object's exhibit history is a factor worth consideration when understanding its condition. Recent display and exposure to light may require the object to rest in storage for a period before allowing it to be exhibited again. The preparation for a loan gets more extensive with insurance, loan contracts, couriers and considerations for travel. The object needs to be packed and crated with the object's specific requirements, such as thermal insulation, waterproofing, reusable closure systems, or travel frames. The size of an object's crate will need to be considered for entrance and exit into buildings.&lt;ref name="MRM5" /&gt; Exhibition loans have more variables that come into play than with in-house exhibitions, so consultation with a registrar or curator is optimal for individual collectors.

===Safety and Security===
The safety of all objects in a collection should always be at the forefront of decision making. Human negligence is the largest factor in harm done to collections. The many types of objects in a collection require various handling procedures. Yet all objects have some handling rules in common: prepare yourself, do not rush, plan ahead, and think through the procedures before laying a hand on any object.&lt;ref name="MRM5" /&gt; Security is an important aspect of exhibition development that works to keep cultural heritage objects safe. Security measures can involve locking cases, adding weight or fasteners in a display case to prevent tipping, a security system, and having guards or staff members in the exhibition space.

===Remedial preparation===
Preventive conservation as a long term approach for conservation “involves maintaining the details of appearance and behavior of an object as well as possible and for as long as possible.”&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Barbara|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2010|publisher=Barbara Appelbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, a discussion about the condition of the object and the state to which stake holders would prefer the object should happen. The medium of an object will give rise to the desired appearance. For example, a painting with obvious problems to its structure, or the condition is questionable, may be deemed unusable for exhibition. Concerns for how an object should appear during an exhibition will precede a decision to conduct conservation treatment. The ideal state of an object is different for each collector and institution. The reason for having an object in the first place will affect the conservation treatment desired. A museum, for example, may research an object and hold the maker's, or artist's, original vision at the time of creation as being the ideal state. An object may have sentimental value for an individual collector, which could make the desired ideal state one of disrepair. The many versions of what an ideal state could be for an object is the work a conservator will do to prepare for any corrective action. If the object needs conservation/restoration treatment such as repairs, cleaning, and reframing, a time line and budget will usually be prepared by the conservator. Another concern is an object's matting, frame or mount, as these should be examined to ensure that the matting materials are archival and that the technique is appropriate.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment of the Exhibition===
The lighting and climate conditions of the exhibit space is an important factor to consider when preparing an object. Many mediums are extremely sensitive to light. [[Light]] is radiant energy that permanently damages light sensitive materials by catalyzing degradation reactions.&lt;ref name="MRM5" /&gt; The space where an object will be exhibited should be inspected and the proper light levels should be recommended for the medium type. Sunlight coming through a window and hitting a wall where an oil painting hangs may not cause the same level of consequences as a light bulb directly over a manuscript on parchment. The recommended light levels for the type of object to be displayed can be referenced by consulting with a collections care professional, or the professional texts and websites listed below. The use of [[Light meter|lux meters]] and ultraviolet meters can give the current light levels in an exhibit space.

The climate of the space is a factor of crucial concern, this consists of humidity and temperature. Humidity causes moisture absorption and acid hydrolysis which can facilitate biological attacks. Temperature influences the rate of chemical reactions, this can cause hardening or desiccation, leading to physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hornbeck|first1=Stephanie E.|title=A Conservation Conundrum|journal=African Arts|date=Autumn 2009|volume=42|issue=3|pages=52–61|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=43184299&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Thermo-hygrograph|Hygrothermographs]], data loggers, and thermohygrometers can provide information on the climate levels in the exhibit space, and inside any cases or pedestals.&lt;ref name="MRM5" /&gt; Adjustments to the HVAC system may be made with the information gathered, or use buffering materials to reach the desired climate. The variables of an exhibit space environment must be weighed against the variables of the object's medium and condition. All of these variables will correlate to the desired exhibition conditions.
[[File:Gurkha Museum display case.JPG|thumb|objects on display with special mounts fabricated]]

A support and/or mount may need to be fabricated for the display. Mounts provide form and stability and relieve stress, thereby preventing distortions, creasing, and eventual damage.&lt;ref name="MRM5" /&gt; An analysis of the object's stress points and best angle for viewing should be considered when realizing the mount. The design of a mount should be as simple as possible with easy removal. The mount should keep the object from any movement while on display, as cases can be bumped by visitors.

===Communication with Cultural Representatives===
When ethnographic objects are chosen for exhibition, a line of communication with cultural representatives within the culture that created the object should happen to determine the proper preparation that follows their beliefs. The wide variety of organic and inorganic materials that ethnographic objects are made from, coupled with the cultural sensitivity required, constitutes a unique set of conservation concerns. The goal of a conservator is to stabilize an object and to preserve all of the cultural and historical information it contains, rather than only to restore its original appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carolyn L. Rose|authorlink1=Preserving Ethnographic Objects|editor1-last=Bachmann|editor1-first=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns: A guide for collectors and curators|publisher=the Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of the object may give clues to its use and cultural significance, such as wear in a certain area or residue. The information these clues give is invaluable and consultation with experts in, and representatives of, the culture of origin will aid in decisions about the object's ideal state and any conservation treatments before display in an exhibition.

Objects have been collected from native cultures for hundreds of years, and the removal of objects from their origin has created much debate and legal policies have been created around acquiring and displaying them. The 1970 UNESCO Convention provided a framework among nations for alleviating abuses in the international trade of cultural property.&lt;ref name="Legal Primer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogany|title=A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=87–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; An act of Congress to which collecting institutions that receive federal funding must adhere to is the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA]]. This act requires consultation, among other things, with Native American tribes, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiian organizations to reach agreements on repatriation or other disposition of remains and objects. In addition, NAGPRA prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains and cultural items.&lt;ref name="Museum Admin" /&gt; There are many regulations to adhere to when exhibiting objects. A knowledge of the various laws will be required by museum staff and an object's [[provenance]] should be well vetted before inclusion in an exhibition.

The [[human body]] and even its individual [[body fluid]]s may be [[concept]]ually divided into various '''fluid compartments''', which, although not literally [[fascial compartment|anatomic compartments]], do represent a real division in terms of how portions of the body's [[water]], [[solution|solutes]], and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]]  elements are segregated. The two main fluid compartments are the intracellular and extracellular compartments. The intracellular compartment is the space within the organism's [[cell (biology)|cells]]; it is separated from the extracellular compartment by [[cell membrane]]s.&lt;ref name="RhoadesBell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodney A. Rhoades|author2=David R. Bell|title=Medical Phisiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kGcFOKCUzkC&amp;pg=PA5|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-427-3|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two thirds of the [[body water|total body water]] of humans is held in the cells, mostly in the [[cytosol]], and the remainder is found in the extracellular compartment. The extracellular fluids may be divided into three types: [[interstitial fluid]] in the "interstitial compartment" (surrounding tissue cells and bathing them in a solution of nutrients and other chemicals), [[blood plasma]] and [[lymph]] in the "intravascular compartment" (inside the [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymphatic vessel]]s), and small amounts of [[transcellular fluid]] such as [[Aqueous humour|ocular]] and  [[Cerebrospinal fluid|cerebrospinal]] fluids in the "transcellular compartment". The interstitial and intravascular compartments readily exchange water and solutes but the third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, is thought of as separate from the other two and not in dynamic equilibrium with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacob M, Chappell D, Rehm M |title=The 'third space'--fact or fiction? |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=145–57 |year=2009 |pmid=19653435 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intracellular compartment ==

The intracellular fluid, also known as [[cytosol]], is all fluid contained inside the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Thomas A.|title=Rapid Review Physiology|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323072607|page=2|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=mr1KI4lFYekC&amp;pg=PA2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the matrix in which cellular [[organelle]]s are suspended. The cytosol and organelles together compose the [[cytoplasm]]. The [[cell membrane]]s are the outer barrier. In humans, the intracellular compartment contains on average about 8 litres of fluid, and under ordinary circumstances remains in [[osmosis|osmotic]] equilibrium. It contains moderate quantities of magnesium and sulphate ions.

== Extracellular compartment ==
The interstitial, intravascular and transcellular compartments comprise the extracellular compartment. Its [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) contains about one-third of [[total body water]].

=== Interstitial compartment ===
The interstitial compartment (also called "tissue space") surrounds tissue cells.  It is filled with [[interstitial fluid]]. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]] that allows for movement of [[ions]], [[proteins]] and [[nutrients]] across the cell barrier. This fluid is not static, but is continually being refreshed by the [[capillary|blood capillaries]] and recollected by [[lymph capillary|lymphatic capillaries]]. In the average male (70&amp;nbsp;kg) human body, the interstitial space has approximately 10.5 litres of fluid.

===Intravascular compartment===
The main intravascular fluid in mammals is [[blood]], a complex [[mixture]] with elements of a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] ([[blood cell]]s), [[colloid]] ([[globulin]]s), and [[solutes]] ([[glucose]] and [[ion]]s). The blood represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside the blood cells) and the extracellular compartment (the [[blood plasma]]). The other intravascular fluid is [[lymph]]. It too represents both the intracellular compartment (the fluid inside its [[lymphocyte]]s) and the extracellular compartment (the noncellular matrix of the lymph, which is roughly equivalent to [[serum (blood)|serum]]). The average volume of plasma in the average (70&amp;nbsp;kg) male is approximately 3.5 liters.  The volume of the intravascular compartment is regulated in part by [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic]] pressure gradients, and by reabsorption by the kidneys.

===Transcellular compartment===
The third extracellular compartment, the transcellular, consists of those spaces in the body where fluid does not normally collect in larger amounts,&lt;ref name="Timby2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Kuhn Timby|title=Fundamental Nursing Skills and Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4HwH5IxfToC&amp;pg=PA319|accessdate=9 June 2010|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7909-8|pages=319–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12219956"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redden M, Wotton K |title=Third-space fluid shift in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery: Part 1: Pathophysiological mechanisms |journal=Contemp Nurse |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=275–83 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12219956 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where any significant fluid collection is physiologically nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Drain, Cecil B. |title=Perianesthesia nursing: a critical care approach |publisher=W.B. Saunders Co |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-9257-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vy9K9cWnsV0C]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of transcellular spaces include the eye, the central nervous system, the [[peritoneal cavity|peritoneal]] and [[pleural cavity|pleural]] cavities, and the [[joint capsule]]s. A small amount of fluid, called [[transcellular fluid]], does exist normally in such spaces. For example, the [[aqueous humor]], the [[vitreous humor]], the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the [[serous fluid]] produced by the [[serous membrane]]s, and the [[synovial fluid]] produced by the [[synovial membrane]]s are all transcellular fluids. They are all very important, yet there is not much of each. For example, there is only about 150&amp;nbsp;mL of cerebrospinal fluid in the entire central nervous system at any moment. All of the aforementioned fluids are produced by active cellular processes working with blood plasma as the raw material, and they are all more or less similar to blood plasma except for certain modifications tailored to their function. For example, the cerebrospinal fluid is made by various cells of the CNS, mostly the [[ependyma]]l cells, from blood plasma.

==Fluid shift==
''Fluid shifts'' occur when the body's fluids move between the fluid compartments. Physiologically, this occurs by a combination of [[hydrostatic pressure]] gradients and [[osmotic pressure]] gradients. Water will move from one space into the next passively across a semi permeable membrane until the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients balance each other. Many medical conditions can cause fluid shifts. When fluid moves out of the intravascular compartment (the blood vessels), blood pressure can drop to dangerously low levels, endangering critical organs such as the [[brain]], [[heart]] and [[kidney]]s; when it shifts out of the cells (the intracellular compartment), cellular processes slow down or cease from intracellular dehydration; when excessive fluid accumulates in the interstitial space, [[oedema]] develops; and fluid shifts into the brain cells can cause increased cranial pressure. Fluid shifts may be compensated by [[fluid replacement]] or [[diuretic]]s.

===Third spacing===
"Third spacing" is the abnormal accumulation of fluid into an extracellular and extravascular space. In medicine, the term is often used with regard to loss of fluid into interstitial spaces, such as with [[burn (injury)|burns]] or [[edema]], but it can also refer to fluid shifts into a body cavity (transcellular space), such as [[ascites]] and [[pleural effusion]]s. With regard to severe burns, fluids may pool on the burn site (i.e. fluid lying outside of the interstitial tissue, exposed to evaporation) and cause depletion of the fluids. With [[pancreatitis]] or [[ileus]], fluids may "leak out" into the [[peritoneal cavity]], also causing depletion of the intracellular, interstitial or vascular compartments.

Patients who undergo long, difficult operations in large surgical fields can collect third-space fluids and become intravascularly depleted despite large volumes of intravenous fluid and blood replacement.

The precise volume of fluid in a patient's third spaces changes over time and is difficult to accurately quantify.

Third spacing conditions may include [[peritonitis]], [[pyometritis]], and [[pleural effusion]]s.&lt;ref name="urlFLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/clinsci/wing/fluids/fluids.htm |title=FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY |work= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrocephalus]] and [[glaucoma]] are theoretically forms of third spacing, but the volumes are too small to induce significant shifts in blood volumes, or overall body volumes, and thus are generally not referred to as third spacing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23827">The '''Gödel Prize''' is an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of [[theoretical computer science]], given jointly by [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS) and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory ([[ACM SIGACT]]). The award is named in honor of [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel's connection to theoretical computer science is that he was the first to mention the "[[P versus NP]]" question, in a 1956 letter to [[John von Neumann]] in which Gödel asked whether a certain [[NP-complete]] problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel Prize has been awarded since 1993. The prize is awarded either at STOC (ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]], one of the main [[North American]] conferences in theoretical computer science) or ICALP ([[International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming]], one of the main [[Europe]]an conferences in the field).  To be eligible for the prize, a paper must be published in a refereed journal within the last 14 (formerly 7) years.  The prize includes a reward of US$5000.&lt;ref name="Godël2017" /&gt;

The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT.

A '''hidden message''' is information that is not immediately noticeable, and that must be discovered or uncovered and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] codes such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as [[backmasking]] and [[steganography]], many so-called hidden messages are merely [[Pareidolia|fanciful imaginings]] or [[apophany]].

== Description ==
The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include [[Backmasking|backwards audio messages]], hidden visual messages, and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] [[code]]s such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.

== Backward audio messages ==
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate [[backmasking]], while others are simply [[phonetic reversal]]s resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, [[video game]]s, [[music video]]s, [[movies]], and [[television show]]s.

=== Backmasking ===
{{Main|Backmasking}}
Backmasking is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by [[The Beatles]], who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]].'' The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to [[Book burning|record-burnings]] and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Phonetic reversal ===
{{Main|Phonetic reversal}}

Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their [[phoneme]]s are reversed—a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, "Kiss" backwards sounds like "sick", and so the title of [[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Kiss Kiss Kiss (Yoko Ono song)|Kiss Kiss Kiss]]" sounds like "Sick Sick Sick" or "Six Six Six" backwards. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as "It's fun to smoke marijuana"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1= N. |last1= Epley |first2= B. |last2= Keysar |first3= L. |last3= Van Boven |first4= T. |last4= Gilovich |title= Perspective Taking as Egocentric Anchoring and Adjustment |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 87 |issue= 3 |pages= 327–339 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15382983 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/its_fun_to_smoke_dust_satanic_panic_preacher_gets_mashed-up_with_queen|title= It's Fun To Smoke Dust! Satanic Panic Preacher Gets Mashed-Up With Queen|first=Christopher|last=Bickel|publisher=Dangerous Minds|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "start to smoke marijuana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Arthur |last= Goldstuck |title= The Rabbit in the Thorn Tree: Modern Myths and Urban Legends of South Africa |year= 1991 |page= 87 |publisher= Penguin Group |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3ZTfAAAAMAAJ |isbn= 0140148078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paul is dead]] phenomenon was started in part because a phonetic reversal of "Number nine" (the words were constantly repeated in ''[[Revolution 9]])'' was interpreted as "Turn me on, dead man".

According to proponents of [[reverse speech]], phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

== Visual messages ==
Hidden messages can be created in visual mediums with techniques such as [[hidden text]] and [[steganography]].

In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, "Feel the Curves!!" An image hidden inside one of the ice cubes was controversial.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/poster.asp|title=Risque Coca-Cola Poster|publisher=Snopes|date=14 May 2011|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Disney (Disney Films)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Snopes website, however, only one image "is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie": images of a topless woman in two frames of ''[[The Rescuers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/rescuers.htm 'The Rescuers' Topless Scene : snopes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards [[PETCO]], a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the [[San Diego Padres]] baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased [[naming rights]] to [[Petco Park]] stadium, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: "Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting [[acrostic]] reads "BOYCOTT PETCO". Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1783769 Rovell, Darren "Secret Message Makes it Into New Park" ESPN.com 4/16/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">[[File:Amoeba (PSF).png|thumb|Amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica uses holozoic nutrition.]]
'''Holozoic nutrition''' (Greek: ''holo''-whole ; ''zoikos''-of animals) is a type of [[heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] [[nutrition]] that is characterized by the internalization ([[ingestion]]) and internal processing of gaseous, liquid or solid food particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Integrated Principles of Zoology, 14th ed.|vauthors=Hickman C, Roberts L, Keen S, Larson A, I'Anson H, Eisenhour D |publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Protozoa]], such as [[amoeba]]s, and most of the free living animals,such as animals, exhibit this type of nutrition. 

In Holozoic nutrition the energy and organic building blocks are obtained by ingesting and then digesting other organisms or pieces of other organisms, including blood and decaying organic matter.  This contrasts with [[holophytic nutrition]], in which energy and organic building blocks are obtained through [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemosynthesis]], and with saprozoic nutrition, in which [[digestive enzyme]]s are released externally and the resulting [[monomer]]s (small organic molecules) are absorbed directly from the environment.

There are several stages of holozoic nutrition, which often occur in separate compartments within an organism (such as the stomach and intestines):
#[[Ingestion]]: In animals, this is merely takes place by engulfing the food totally in the mouth.  In protozoa, this most commonly occurs through [[phagocytosis]].
#[[Digestion]]: The physical breakdown of complex large and organic food particles and the [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] breakdown of complex organic compounds into small, simple molecules.
#[[Digestion#Overview of vertebrate digestion|Absorption]]: The [[Active transport|active]] and [[passive transport]] of the chemical products of digestion out of the food-containing compartment and into the body or cytoplasm.[[Assimilation (biology)|Assimilation]]: Utilization of the absorbed molecules for various [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes.
#[[Egestion]]: The expulsion of undigested material, commonly called [[defecating]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">'''Hypotext''' is an earlier text which serves as the source of a subsequent piece of literature, or [[hypertext (semiotics)|hypertext]].&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bronwen|title=Key Terms in Semiotics|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANBLPmfvSusC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 August 2013|isbn=0-8264-8456-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] could be regarded as the hypotext for [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

The word  was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the hypertext) to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the ''hypotext''), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly.  The hypertext may of course become original text in its own right.&lt;ref name="Allen2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Graham|title=The New Critical Idiom|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Ch 3: Hypertextuality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has more recently been used in extended ways, for example, Adamczewski suggests that the [[Iliad]] was used as a ''structuring hypotext'' in [[Mark's Gospel]].&lt;ref name="Adamczewski2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamczewski|first=Bartosz |title=Q Or Not Q?: The So-Called Triple, Double, and Single Traditions in the Synoptic Gospels|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Internet}}
'''Internet slang''' ('''Internet shorthand''', '''cyber-slang''', '''netspeak''', or '''chatspeak''') refers to various kinds of [[slang]] used by different people on the [[Internet]]. An example of Internet slang is "&lt;code&gt;[[:wikt:LOL#English|LOL]]&lt;/code&gt;" meaning "laugh out loud". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.&lt;ref name=Yin&gt;Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English "Internet Slang Union". Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education. Vol. 1. {{ISSN|1001-5795}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be understood to be any type of [[slang]] that [[Internet]] users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving [[keystroke]]s or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same [[abbreviation]]s in [[text messaging|texting]] and [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking websites]]. [[Acronym]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard symbols]] and [[abbreviation]]s are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as [[leet]] or [[Lolcat|Lolspeak]], develop as [[ingroup]] [[internet meme]]s rather than time savers. Some people only use LOL for fun. Many people use this [[internet slang]] not only on the Internet but also face-to-face.

==Creation and evolution==

===Origins===
Internet slang originated in the early days of the Internet with some terms predating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daw |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang is used in [[chat room]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[online game]]s, [[video game]]s and in the [[online community]]. Since 1979, users of communications networks like [[Usenet]] created their own [[shorthand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meggyn |url=http://theunderenlightened.com/trolling-for-slang-the-origins-of-internet-werdz/ |title=Trolling For Slang: The Origins of Internet Werdz |publisher=Theunderenlightened.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pop culture==
In Japanese, the term [[moe (slang)|moe]] has come into common use among slang users to mean something extremely cute and appealing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Aside from the more frequent abbreviations, acronyms, and [[emoticon]]s, Internet slang also uses archaic words or the lesser-known meanings of mainstream terms.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Regular words can also be altered into something with a similar pronunciation but altogether different meaning, or attributed new meanings altogether.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Phonetic transcriptions of foreign words, such as the transformation of "impossible" into "&lt;code&gt;impossibru&lt;/code&gt;" in Japanese and then [the [[transliteration]] of that] back to [the character set used for] English, also occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In places where [[logograph]]ic languages are used, such as China, a visual Internet slang exists, giving characters dual meanings, one direct and one implied.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt;

===Motivations===
The primary motivation for using a slang unique to the Internet is to ease [[communication]]. However, while Internet slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand, according to a study by the [[University of Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't be 404, know the tech slang|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775013.stm|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, similar to the use of slang in traditional face-to-face speech or written language, slang on the Internet is often a way of indicating [[social group|group membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=1997|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|edition= Second |location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet slang provides a channel which facilitates and constrains our ability to communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from those found in other semiotic situations. Many of the expectations and practices which we associate with spoken and written language are no longer applicable. The Internet itself is ideal for new slang to emerge because of the richness of the medium and the availability of information.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; Slang is also thus motivated for the “creation and sustenance of online communities”.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; These communities, in turn, play a role in solidarity or identification&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name= miao /&gt; or an exclusive or common cause.&lt;ref name=mud /&gt;

David Crystal distinguishes among five areas of the Internet where slang is used- [[World Wide Web|The Web itself]], [[email]], [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous chat]] (for example, [[mailing list]]s), [[synchronous communication|synchronous chat]] (for example, [[Internet Relay Chat]]), and [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=2001|title= Language and the Internet|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-80212-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer|electronic]] character of the channel has a fundamental influence on the language of the medium. Options for communication are constrained by the nature of the hardware needed in order to gain Internet access. Thus, productive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be sent) is determined by the preassigned characters on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], and receptive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be seen) is determined by the size and configuration of the screen. Additionally, both sender and receiver are constrained linguistically by the properties of the internet [[software]], [[computer hardware]], and [[networking hardware]] linking them. Electronic discourse refers to writing that is "very often reads as if it were being spoken – that is, as if the sender were writing talking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Davis, B.H. &amp; Brewer, J. P. |date=1997 |title=Electronic discourse: linguistic individuals in virtual space|location= Albany, NY|publisher= State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of slang==

Internet slang does not constitute a homogeneous language variety. Rather, it differs according to the user and type of Internet situation.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter (2005). Elements of traditional and "reverse" purism in relation to computer-mediated communication. In Langer, Nils and Winifred V. Davies (eds.), Linguistic Purism in the Germanic Languages. Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 203-220.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the language of Internet slang, there is still an element of [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], as seen in [[style guides]], for example ''Wired Style'',&lt;ref name=hale&gt;[Hale, C. and Scanlon, J (1999). Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. New York: Broadway Books]&lt;/ref&gt; which are specifically aimed at usage on the Internet. Even so, few users consciously heed these prescriptive recommendations on CMC, but rather adapt their styles based on what they encounter online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi. (2000). ''Alphabet to Email.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is difficult to produce a clear definition of Internet slang, the following types of slang may be observed. This list is not exhaustive.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Description
|-
| Letter homophones || Included within this group are [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s. An abbreviation is a shortening of a word, for example "&lt;code&gt;CU&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;CYA&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you (see ya)". An acronym, on the other hand, is a subset of abbreviations and are formed from the initial components of a word. Examples of common acronyms include "&lt;code&gt;LOL&lt;/code&gt;" for "laugh out loud", "&lt;code&gt;BTW&lt;/code&gt;" for "by the way" and "&lt;code&gt;TFW&lt;/code&gt;" for "that feeling when". There are also combinations of both, like "&lt;code&gt;CUL8R&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you later".
|-
| Punctuation, capitalizations, and other symbols || Such features are commonly used for emphasis. Periods or exclamation marks may be used repeatedly for emphasis, such as "&lt;code&gt;........&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/code&gt;". Question marks and exclamation marks are often used together in strings such as "&lt;code&gt;?!?!?!?!&lt;/code&gt;" when one is angry while asking a question. Grammatical punctuation rules are also relaxed on the Internet. "E-mail" may simply be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;", and apostrophes can be dropped so that "John's book" becomes "&lt;code&gt;johns book&lt;/code&gt;". Examples of capitalizations include "&lt;code&gt;STOP IT&lt;/code&gt;", which can convey a stronger emotion of annoyance as opposed to "stop it". Bold, underline and italics are also used to indicate stress.
|-
| Onomatopoeic and/or stylized spellings || [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] spellings have also become popularized on the Internet. One well-known example is "&lt;code&gt;hahaha&lt;/code&gt;" to indicate laughter. Onomatopoeic spellings are very language specific. For instance, in Spanish, laughter is spelled as "&lt;code&gt;jajaja&lt;/code&gt;" instead because J is pronounced like H in Spanish. In Thai it's 55555 because 5 in Thai is said Ha. In Korean, it is "&lt;code&gt;kekeke&lt;/code&gt;".
|-
| Keyboard-generated emoticons and smileys || [[Emoticon]]s are generally found in web forums, instant messengers, and online games. They are culture-specific and certain emoticons are only found in some languages but not in others. For example, the Japanese equivalent of emoticons, kaomoji (literally "face marks"), focus on the eyes instead of the mouth as in Western emoticons. They are also meant to be read right-side up, as in &lt;code&gt;^_^&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to sideways, &lt;code&gt;:3&lt;/code&gt;. More recently than face emoticons, other emoticon symbols such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;3&lt;/code&gt; (which is a sideways heart) have emerged. Compared to emoticons used in Western cultures such as the [[United States]], kaomoji play a very distinct social role in online discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Katsuno, Hirofumi and Christine R. Yano (2002), ''[[Asian Studies Review]]'' 26(2): 205-231&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Direct requests || These are found in chat engines such as [[Internet Relay Chat]] or online games, where personal identities may be concealed. As such, questions such as "&lt;code&gt;A/S/L?&lt;/code&gt;" which stands for "age, sex, location?" are commonly posed.&lt;ref name=Thurlow&gt;Thurlow, C. (2001), Language and the Internet, In R, Mesthrie &amp; R, Asher (Eds), The concise encyclopedia of sociolinguistics, London: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Leet || [[Leet]]speak, or &lt;code&gt;1337&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1337 - what is it and how to be 1337|url=http://www.1337.net/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative alphabet for the English language which uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, Wikipedia may be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;\/\/1|&lt;1p3[)14&lt;/code&gt;". It originated from computer hacking, but its use has been extended to online gaming as well. Leet is far less common now than in the first decades of the internet.
|-
| Novel [[syntax|syntactic]] features || Unusual syntactic structures such as "[[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]" and "You are doing me a frighten" have been encouraged and spread by highly successful memes. Pluralization of "the internets" is another example, which has become common since it was used by [[George W. Bush]] during a televised event.
|-
| [[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] || Flaming refers to the use of rude or profane language in interactions between Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, N.S. (2003). Language of the Internet. In A. Farghali (Ed.), The Stanford handbook for language engineers (pp. 59—127). Stanford, California: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; It can be caused by any subject of polarizing nature. For example, there is an ongoing debate among users of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[classic Mac OS]]/[[macOS]] as to which is "superior". Historically, the act of flaming has been described as an intrinsic quality of [[email]]s due to an absence of visual and auditory cues in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Martin, Tim O’Shea, Pat Fung, and Russel Spears (1992), ‘Flaming’ in Computer-Mediated Communication. Contexts of Computer-Mediated Communication, ed. Martin Lea, 89-112. New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Padonkaffsky jargon]] || Olbanian language is a [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Cant (language)|cant]] language developed by [[padonki]] of [[Runet]]. The language entered mainstream culture and it has been suggested that Olbanian should be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usrbc.org/resources/russiannews/event/1192 |title=Reuters |publisher=Usrbc.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems exist for other languages with non-Roman scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic.

==Views on Internet slang==

There have been ongoing debates about how the use of slang on the Internet influences language usage outside of technology. Even though the direct causal relationship between the Internet and language has yet to be proven by any scientific research,&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |title=Internet’s Effect on Language Debated |publisher=Newjerseynewsroom.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422130830/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang has invited split views on its influence on the standard of language use in non-computer-mediated communications.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivists]] tend to have the widespread belief that the Internet has a negative influence on the future of language, and that it would lead to a degradation of standard.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal /&gt; Some would even attribute any decline of standard formal English to the increase in usage of electronic communication.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; It has also been suggested that the linguistic differences between Standard English and CMC can have implications for literacy education.&lt;ref&gt;Hawisher, Gale E. and Cynthia L. Selfe (eds). (2002). Global Literacies and the World-Wide Web. London/New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the widely reported example of a school essay submitted by a Scottish teenager, which contained many abbreviations and acronyms likened to [[SMS language]]. There was great condemnation of this style by the mass media as well as educationists, who expressed that this showed diminishing literacy or linguistic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Is txt mightier than the word? |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] have counter-argued that the Internet allows better expressions of a language.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; Rather than established linguistic conventions, linguistic choices sometimes reflect personal taste.&lt;ref name=baron&gt;Baron, Naomi S. (2002). Who sets email style: Prescriptivism, coping strategies, and democratizing communication access. The Information Society 18, 403-413&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that as opposed to intentionally flouting language conventions, Internet slang is a result of a lack of motivation to monitor speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi (2003) “Why Email Looks Like Speech: Proofreading Pedagogy and Public Face.” In New Media Language, ed. Jean Aitchison and Diana M. Lewis, 85–94. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Hale and Scanlon describe language in Emails as being derived from "writing the way people talk", and that there is no need to insist on 'Standard' English.&lt;ref name=hale /&gt; English users, in particular, have an extensive tradition of etiquette guides, instead of traditional prescriptive treatises, that offer pointers on linguistic appropriateness.&lt;ref name=baron /&gt; Using and spreading Internet slang also adds onto the cultural currency of a language.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; It is important to the speakers of the language due to the foundation it provides for identifying within a group, and also for defining a person’s individual linguistic and communicative competence.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; The result is a specialized subculture based on its use of slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"&gt;Simon-Vandenbergen, Anne Marie (2008) Deciphering L33t5p34k: Internet Slang on Message Boards. Thesis paper. Ghent University Faculty of Arts and Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarly research, attention has, for example, been drawn to the effect of the use of Internet slang in [[ethnography]], and more importantly to how conversational relationships online change structurally because slang is used.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia, Angela Cora, Standlee, Alecea I., Beckhoff, Jennifer and Yan Cui. Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. Vol. 38 No. 1 pp 52–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, there is already considerable controversy regarding the use of [[anglicisms]] outside of CMC.&lt;ref&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter. (2002). Standardization, language change, resistance and the question of linguistic threat: 18th-century English and present-day German. In: Linn, Andrew R. and Nicola McLelland (eds.). Standardization - Studies from the Germanic languages. Amsterdam: Benjamins (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory volume 235), 153-178&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is even more problematic within CMC, since the [[jargon]] of the medium is dominated by English terms.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus /&gt; An extreme example of an anti-anglicisms perspective can be observed from the chatroom rules of a Christian site,&lt;ref&gt;[https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/cilt/main] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bans all anglicisms ("Das Verwenden von Anglizismen ist strengstens untersagt!" [Using anglicisms is strictly prohibited!]), and also translates even fundamental terms into German equivalents.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus /&gt;

===Journalism===
In April 2014, [[Gawker]]'s [[editor-in-chief]] Max Read instituted new writing style guidelines banning internet slang for his writing staff.&lt;ref name="Gawker bans 'Internet slang'"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Andrew|last1=Beaujon|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/246113/gawker-bans-internet-slang/|title=Gawker bans ‘Internet slang’|work=[[Poynter Institute]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128120629/http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/246113/gawker-bans-internet-slang/|archivedate=28 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawker Rips Buzzfeed in Ban on ‘WTF,’ ‘Epic’ and Other Internet Slang From Its Website"&gt;{{cite news|first1=James |last1=Crugnale |url=http://www.thewrap.com/gawker-rips-buzzfeed-ban-internet-slang/|title=Gawker Rips Buzzfeed in Ban on ‘WTF,’ ‘Epic’ and Other Internet Slang From Its Website|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="‘Massive’ Attack: Gawker Goes After Whopping Word"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Matthew |last1=Kassel |url=http://observer.com/2014/04/massive-attack-gawker-goes-after-whopping-word/|title=‘Massive’ Attack: Gawker Goes After Whopping Word|work=[[The New York Observer]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawker Editor Bans 'Internet Slang,' Challenges Staff to 'Sound Like Regular Human Beings'"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Alex |last1=Weaver |url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/04/03/gawker-editor-bans-internet-slang/|title=Gawker Editor Bans 'Internet Slang,' Challenges Staff to 'Sound Like Regular Human Beings'|work=[[BostInno]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A ban on internet slang?

==Use beyond computer-mediated communication==
Internet [[slang]] has crossed from being mediated by the computer into other non-physical domains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Crystal, David (September 20, 2001). Language and the Internet. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80212-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, these domains are taken to refer to any domain of interaction where interlocutors need not be geographically proximate to one another, and where the Internet is not primarily used. Internet slang is now prevalent in telephony, mainly through short messages ([[SMS]]) communication. [[Abbreviation]]s and [[interjection]]s, especially, have been popularized in this medium, perhaps due to the limited character space for writing messages on mobile phones. Another possible reason for this spread is the convenience of transferring the existing mappings between expression and meaning into a similar space of interaction.&lt;ref name=new.bbc.co.uk&gt;"Don't be 404, know the tech slang". BBC. December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Internet slang has also taken a place as part of everyday [[offline]] language, among those with digital access.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The nature and content of [[online]] conversation is brought forward to direct [[offline]] [[communication]] through the [[telephone]] and direct talking, as well as through [[Orthography|written language]], such as in writing notes or letters. In the case of interjections, such as numerically based and abbreviated Internet slang, are not pronounced as they are written physically or replaced by any actual action. Rather, they become [[Lexicalisation|lexicalized]] and spoken like non-slang words in a “stage direction” like fashion, where the actual action is not carried out but substituted with a verbal signal. The notions of flaming and [[troll (Internet)|trolling]] have also extended outside the computer, and are used in the same circumstances of deliberate or unintentional implicatures.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt;

The expansion of Internet slang has been furthered through codification and the promotion of digital literacy. The subsequently existing and growing popularity of such references among those online as well as offline has thus advanced Internet slang [[Digital literacy|literacy]] and globalized it.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (2004) The glocal village: Internet and community. Arts and Science Review. University of Toronto. Issue 1, Series 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness and proficiency in manipulating Internet slang in both online and offline communication indicates digital literacy and teaching materials have even been developed to further this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Singhal |first= M. |title=The Internet and foreign language education: Benefits and challenges |publisher=The Internet TESL Journal |year=1997 |url=http://iteslj.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A South Korean publisher, for example, has published a textbook that details the meaning and context of use for common Internet slang instances and is targeted at young children who will soon be using the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ashcroft, Brian (2010) Hey Korean Kids, Let’s Learn Leetspeak And Internet Slang. Published February 11th, 2010. Retrieved from [http://kotaku.com/5469239/hey-korean-kids-lets-learn-leetspeak-and-internet-slang]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Internet slang has been recommended as language teaching material in second language classrooms in order to raise communicative competence by imparting some of the cultural value attached to a language that is available only in slang.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, M. (2004) Integration of Effective Internet Resources for Future Teachers of Bilingual Ed. National Association of African American Studies, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, well-known dictionaries such as the [[Oxford Dictionary of English|OED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/category/word-trends-and-new-words/ |title=Oxford Dictionary official blog |publisher=Blog.oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merriam-Webster]] have been updated with a significant and growing body of slang jargon. Besides common examples, lesser known slang and slang with a non-English etymology have also found a place in standardized linguistic references. Along with these instances, literature in user-contributed dictionaries such as [[Urban Dictionary]] has also been added to. Codification seems to be qualified through frequency of use, and novel creations are often not accepted by other users of slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Brian |url=http://www.noslang.com/rejects/ |title=Rejects |publisher=Noslang.com |accessdate= 28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet slang today===
Although Internet slang began as a means of "opposition" to mainstream language, its popularity with today's globalized digitally literate population has shifted it into a part of everyday language, where it also leaves a profound impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unbulleted list | {{cite web |last= Eller |first= Lara L. |year= 2005 |work= Thesis |title= Instant Message Communication and its Impact upon Written Language |publisher= [[West Virginia University]] |url=  http://www.wvu.edu/ }}
{{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= WVU Scholar |url= http://wvuscholar.wvu.edu/ |subscription= yes }}
 | {{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= University of Hong Kong |url= http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3632984 |subscription= yes }} | {{cite web |format= pdf |title= Alternate source |website= Research Gate |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267419817_Instant_Message_Communication_and_its_Impact_upon_Written_Language }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently used slang also have become conventionalised into memetic "unit[s] of cultural information".&lt;ref name=bas&gt;{{cite web |last=Flamand |first=E |year=2008 |title=The impossible task of dialog analysis in chatboxes |url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:D28k7Tswv5wJ:scholar.google.com/+internet+slang+meme&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These memes in turn are further spread through their use on the Internet, prominently through websites. The Internet as an "information superhighway" is also catalysed through slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"/&gt; The evolution of slang has also created a 'slang union'&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as part of a unique, specialised subculture.&lt;ref name=annemarie /&gt; Such impacts are, however, limited and requires further discussion especially from the non-English world. This is because Internet slang is prevalent in languages more actively used on the [[Internet]], like [[English language|English]], which is the [[Internet]]’s [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20332763|title=Learn English online: How the internet is changing language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html|title=English - the universal language on the Internet?|quote=English essentially is the universal language of the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, which is done by Chinese [[netizen]]. This is a satire of [[Chinese Internet censorship]]. See [[Grass Mud Horse]].]]

The Internet has helped people from all over the world to become connected to one another, enabling "global" relationships to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman (2004). "The Glocal Village: Internet and Community." ''Ideas&amp;s'' Vol 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is important for the various types of slang used online to be recognizable for everyone. It is also important to do so because of how other languages are quickly catching up with English on the Internet, following the increase in Internet usage in predominantly non-English speaking countries. In fact, as of May 31, 2011, only approximately 27% of the online population is made up of English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Internet World Stats |publisher=Internet World Stats |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different cultures tend to have different motivations behind their choice of slang, on top of the difference in language used. For example, in [[Chinese Internet Slang|China]], because of the tough Internet regulations imposed, users tend to use certain slang to talk about issues deemed as sensitive to the government. These include using symbols to separate the characters of a word to avoid detection from manual or automated text pattern scanning and consequential [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Shuguang (2008). "Notes On The Net." ''Index on Censorship'' Vol 37:2&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding example is the use of the term [[river crab (Internet slang)|&lt;code&gt;river crab&lt;/code&gt;]] to denote censorship. River crab (hexie) is pronounced the same as "harmony"—the official term used to justify political discipline and censorship. As such Chinese netizens reappropriate the official terms in a sarcastic way.&lt;ref&gt;Nordin, Astrid and Richaud, Lisa (2014), "Subverting official language and discourse in China? Type river rrab for harmony," ''China Information'' 28, 1 (March): 47–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abbreviations]] are popular across different cultures, including countries like [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], etc., and are used according to the particular language the Internet users speak. Significantly, this same style of slang creation is also found in non-alphabetical languages&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as, for example, a form of "&lt;code&gt;e gao&lt;/code&gt;" or alternative political discourse.&lt;ref name=mud&gt;Meng Bingchun (2011) "From Steamed Bun to Grass Mud Horse: E Gao as alternative political discourse on the Chinese Internet." ''Global Media and Communication'' April 2011 vol. 7 no. 1 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in language often results in miscommunication, as seen in an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] example, "&lt;code&gt;555&lt;/code&gt;", which sounds like "crying" in Chinese, and "laughing" in Thai.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com&gt;{{cite web |author=Crystal Tao |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |title=Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? |publisher=Lovelovechina.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example is between the English "&lt;code&gt;haha&lt;/code&gt;" and the Spanish "&lt;code&gt;jaja&lt;/code&gt;", where both are onomatopoeic expressions of laughter, but the difference in language also meant a different consonant for the same sound to be produced. For more examples of how other languages express "laughing out loud", see also: [[LOL]]

In terms of culture, in Chinese, the numerically based onomatopoeia "&lt;code&gt;770880&lt;/code&gt;" ({{Zh|c = |s = 亲亲你抱抱你|t = 親親你抱抱你|p = qīn qīn nǐ bào bào nǐ}}), which means to 'kiss and hug you', is used.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com /&gt; This is comparable to "&lt;code&gt;XOXO&lt;/code&gt;", which many Internet users use. In French, "&lt;code&gt;pkoi&lt;/code&gt;" is used in the place of pourquoi, which means 'why'. This is an example of a combination of onomatopoeia and shortening of the original word for convenience when writing online.

In conclusion, every different country has their own language background and cultural differences and hence, they tend to have their own rules and motivations for their own Internet slang. However, at present, there is still a lack of studies done by researchers on some differences between the countries.

On the whole, the popular use of Internet slang has resulted in a unique online and offline community as well as a couple sub-categories of "special internet slang which is different from other slang spread on the whole internet… similar to jargon … usually decided by the sharing community".&lt;ref name=miao&gt;Wei Miao Miao (2010) "Internet slang used by online Japanese anime fans." ''3PM Journal of Digital Researching and Publishing''. Session 2 2010 pp 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to virtual communities marked by the specific slang they use&lt;ref name=miao /&gt; and led to a more homogenized yet diverse online culture.&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name=miao /&gt;

'''''Journal Citation Reports''''' ('''''JCR''''') is an [[annual publication]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the intellectual property of [[Thomson Reuters]]). It has been integrated with the [[Web of Science]] and is accessed from the Web of Science-Core Collections. It provides information about [[academic journal]]s in the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]], including [[impact factor]]s. The ''JCR'' was originally published as a part of ''[[Science Citation Index]]''. Currently, the ''JCR'', as a distinct service, is based on [[citation]]s compiled from the ''[[Science Citation Index Expanded]]'' and the ''[[Social Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref name=evolves&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |year=2007 |title=The evolution of the Science Citation Index |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |doi=10.2436/20.1501.01.10 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=65–69 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/barcelona2007a.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCRhome&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Overview |work=Journal Citation Reports |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625025211/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=About Us |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/about/ |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VenSep2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venkatraman |first=Archana |date=Sep 2009 |title=Journals cherish IF status symbol: but impact factor is not the only citation metric that matters |newspaper=[[Information World Review]] |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic journal information==
The information given for each journal includes:
* the basic bibliographic information of publisher,  title abbreviation, language, ISSN
* the subject categories (there are 171 such categories in the sciences and 54 in the social sciences)

==Citation information==
* Basic citation data:
** the number of articles published during that year and
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
* detailed tables showing
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
** the number of citations made from articles published in the journal that year to it and other specific individual journals during each of the most recent ten years (the 20 journals most cited are included)
** the number of times articles published in the journal during each of the most recent 10 years were cited by individual specific journals during the year (the twenty journals with the greatest number of citation are given)
* and several measures derived from these data for a given journal: its ''[[impact factor]]'', ''[[immediacy index]]'', etc.

There are separate editions for the sciences and the social sciences; the 2013 science edition includes 8,411 journals, and the 2012 social science edition contains 3,016 titles. The issue for each year is published the following year, after the citations for the year have been published and the information processed.

The publication is available online (''JCR on the Web''), or in CD format (''JCR on CD-ROM''); it was originally published in print, with the detailed tables on [[microfiche]].

==Release schedule==
In recent years, it is often released in the middle of June. For example, the 2017 Journal Citation Reports, based on 2016 data, was released on Jun 14, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clarivate.com/blog/the-2017-jcr-release-is-here/|title=The 2017 JCR Release is Here! - Clarivate|date=14 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was founded in 1969 by the Revd Canon Michael Bourdeaux.

==History==
In the 1950s, Michael Bourdeaux spent a year in [[Moscow]] as a part of the first wave of British exchange students; he soon found only 41 [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es to still be functioning out of the 1,600 before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917. This prompted him to take up the cause of those persecuted for their religious faith.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; 

In 1969 Bourdeaux founded at [[Chislehurst]] the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism&lt;ref name=rus&gt;''The Future of Freedom in Russia'', by William J. Vanden Heuvel. Published by Templeton Foundation Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-890151-43-2}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; together with Sir John Lawrence, and with the help of [[Leonard Schapiro]] and Peter Reddaway, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at [[George Washington University]]. In the early 1970s he bought the old parish school on [[Keston]] Common and the centre was renamed [[Keston College]]. Later it broadened its purview to include former communist countries with its main concerns being the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=kes&gt;[http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107044403/http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it played a key role in the revival of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Orthodoxy Resurgent: Faith and Power in the New Russia'', by John Garrard, Carol Garrard. Published by Princeton University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-691-12573-2}}. ''Page xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a leading voice on [[religious freedom]] in former communist countries, with an emphasis on the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2000-1/weekly/210900/ads.htm  the Keston Institute is an Oxford- based research charity which is...] ''[[Oxford University]] Gazette.'', 2000-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the enterprise was relocated to Oxford.

In 1984 [[Michael Bourdeaux]] won the [[Templeton Prize]]. The current chairman at the Keston Institute is [[Xenia Dennen]].

Since 2007, the Keston Institute's archive and library have been under the care of the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, &amp; Society at [[Baylor University]], [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/kestoncenter/ Keston Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''littoral zone''' is the part of a sea, lake or river that is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the [[high water mark]], which is rarely inundated, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this [[intertidal zone]] and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of "littoral zone" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.

There is no single definition. What is regarded as the full extent of the littoral zone, and the way the littoral zone is divided into subregions, varies in different contexts (lakes and rivers have their own definitions). The use of the term also varies from one part of the world to another, and between different disciplines. For example, military commanders speak of the littoral in ways that are quite different from marine biologists.

The adjacency of water gives a number of distinctive characteristics to littoral regions. The [[erosion|erosive]] power of water results in particular types of [[landform]]s, such as [[sand dune]]s, and [[estuary|estuaries]]. The natural movement of the littoral along the coast is called the [[littoral drift]]. Biologically, the ready availability of water enables a greater variety of plant and animal life, and particularly the formation of extensive [[wetlands]]. In addition, the additional local [[humidity]] due to evaporation usually creates a [[microclimate]] supporting unique types of organisms.

The word "littoral" is used both as a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. It derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] noun ''litus, litoris'', meaning "shore". (The doubled 't' is a late medieval innovation and the word is sometimes seen in the more classical-looking spelling 'litoral'.)

{{wiktionary|littoral}}
{{wiktionary|circumlittoral|infralittoral|sublittoral|supralittoral}}

In [[oceanography]] and [[marine biology]], the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Starting from the shoreline, the littoral zone begins at the spray region just above the high tide mark. From here, it moves to the intertidal region between the high and low water marks, and then out as far as the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. These three subregions are called, in order, the [[Littoral zone#Supralittoral zone|supralittoral zone]], the [[Littoral zone#Eublittoral zone|eulittoral zone]] and the [[Littoral zone#Sublittoral zone|sublittoral zone]].

===Supralittoral zone===
{{main|Supralittoral zone}}

The ''supralittoral zone'' (also called the ''splash'', ''spray'' or ''supratidal zone'') is the area above the spring high tide line that is regularly splashed, but not submerged by ocean water. Seawater penetrates these elevated areas only during storms with high tides. Organisms here must cope also with exposure to fresh water from rain, cold, heat and [[predation]] by land animals and seabirds. At the top of this area, patches of dark [[lichen]]s can appear as crusts on rocks. Some types of [[Common periwinkle|periwinkles]], [[Neritidae]] and detritus feeding [[Isopod]]a commonly inhabit the lower supralittoral.&lt;ref name="Yip and Madl"&gt;Yip and Madl&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eulittoral zone===
{{see also|Intertidal zone}}

The ''eulittoral zone'' (also called the ''midlittoral'' or ''mediolittoral zone'') is the ''intertidal zone'' also known as the ''foreshore''. It extends from the spring high tide line, which is rarely inundated, to the spring low tide line, which is rarely not inundated. The wave action and turbulence of recurring tides shapes and reforms cliffs, gaps, and caves, offering a huge range of habitats for sedentary organisms. Protected rocky shorelines usually show a narrow almost homogenous eulittoral strip, often marked by the presence of [[barnacle]]s. Exposed sites show a wider extension and are often divided into further zones. For more on this, see [[intertidal ecology]].

===Sublittoral zone===
{{see also|Neritic zone}}

The ''sublittoral zone'' starts immediately below the eulittoral zone. This zone is permanently covered with seawater and is approximately equivalent to the [[neritic zone]].

In [[physical oceanography]], the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, [[internal wave]]s, river outflows and oceanic fronts. In practice, this typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]], with depths around 200 meters.

In marine biology, the sublittoral refers to the areas where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the [[photic zone]]. This results in high [[primary production]] and makes the sublittoral zone the location of the majority of sea life. As in physical oceanography, this zone typically extends to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. The benthic zone in the sublittoral is much more stable than in the intertidal zone; temperature, water pressure, and the amount of sunlight remain fairly constant. Sublittoral corals do not have to deal with as much change as intertidal corals. [[Coral|Corals]] can live in both zones, but they are more common in the sublittoral zone.

Within the sublittoral, marine biologists also identify the following:
*The '''infralittoral zone''' is the algal dominated zone to maybe five metres below the low water mark.
*The '''circalittoral zone''' is the region beyond the infralittoral, that is, below the algal zone and dominated by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals such as [[oyster]]s.

Shallower regions of the sublittoral zone, extending not far from the shore, are sometimes referred to as the '''subtidal zone'''.

==In freshwater ecosystems==
[[File:Moon Lake shoreline - Riding Mountain National Park.JPG|thumb|right|Shoreline of a lake with nearly unvegetated littoral zone]]

In freshwater situations, littoral zones occur on the edge of large lakes and rivers, often with extensive areas of [[wetland]]. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as fringing wetlands. Here, the effects of tides are minimal, so other definitions of "littoral" are used. For example, the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]] defines littoral as that portion of the lake that is less than 15&amp;nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]] in depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/surveys.html#littoral|title=Fisheries lake surveys| accessdate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The littoral zone may form a narrow or broad fringing wetland, with extensive areas of aquatic plants sorted by their tolerance to different water depths.  Typically, four zones are recognized, from higher to lower on the shore: wooded wetland, [[wet meadow]], [[marsh]] and [[aquatic vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative areas of these four types depends not only on the profile of the shoreline, but upon past water levels.  The area of wet meadow is particularly dependent upon past water levels;&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in general, the area of wet meadows along lakes and rivers increases with natural water level fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, D.A, Thompson, T.A., Booth, R.K. and Nicholas, J.R. 2007. Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes. USGS Circular 1311. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, F.M.R. (ed.). 2003. The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests. FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the animals in lakes and rivers are dependent upon the wetlands of littoral zones, since the rooted plants provide habitat and food. Hence, a large and productive littoral zone is considered an important characteristic of a healthy lake or river.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;

Littoral zones are at particular risk for two reasons.  First, human settlement is often attracted to shorelines, and settlement often disrupts breeding habitats for littoral zone species.  For example, many turtles are killed on roads when they leave the water to lay their eggs in upland sites.  Fish can be negatively affected by docks and retaining walls which remove breeding habitat in shallow water.  Some shoreline communities even deliberately try to remove wetlands since they may interfere with activities like swimming. Overall, the presence of human settlement has a demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houlahan|first1=J. E.|last2=Keddy|first2=P. A.|last3=Makkay|first3=K.|last4=Findlay|first4=C. S.|title=The effects of adjacent land use on wetland species richness and community composition|journal=Wetlands|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=79–96|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[79:TEOALU]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally serious problem is the tendency to stabilize lake or river levels with dams.  Dams removed the spring flood which carries nutrients into littoral zones, and reduces the natural fluctuation of water levels upon which many wetland plants and animals depend.&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, B. A. (ed.) 2002. Flood Pulsing in Wetlands: Restoring the Natural Hydrological Balance. John Wiley, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, over time, dams can reduce the area of wetland from a broad littoral zone to a narrow band of vegetation.  Marshes and wet meadows are at particular risk.

==Other definitions==
For the purposes of naval operations, the [[United States Navy]] divides the littoral zone in the ways shown on the diagram at the top of this article. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have their own definitions, and these have legal implications.

[[File:Peterborough Psalter c 1220-25 Mercy and Truth.jpg|thumb|''Mercy and Truth'' are shown together in a 13th-century representation of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#85|Psalm 85 (10)]]]]
'''Mercy''' ([[Middle English]], from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''merci'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''merced-'', ''merces'', from [[Latin]], "price paid, wages", from ''merc-'', ''merxi'' "merchandise") is [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[forgiveness]], and [[kindness]] in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and [[Law|legal]] contexts.

The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.&lt;ref name=Sarat &gt;Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser. ''Forgiveness, mercy, and clemency'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5333-4}} pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;Menke, Christopher. ''Reflections of equality'' by Christoph Menke 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-4474-2}} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Mercy" can be defined as "compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power"; and  also "a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mercy "Mercy", Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "To be at someone's mercy" indicates a person being "without defense against someone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/at+the+mercy+of "At the mercy of", McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and ethics==
[[File:Spirit of Compassion.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Spirit of Compassion'', commemorating [[World War I]], [[National War Memorial (South Australia)|South Australia]], 1931]]
In a judicial context mercy is often termed "clemency". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Sapp'', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{see also|Works of Mercy}}
Hebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 4:16, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do ''not'' get that which they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack. "What Is The Difference Between Mercy and Grace?"], ''Patheos'', March 17, 2104&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emphasis on mercy appears in the [[New Testament]], for example in the [[Magnificat]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] (Song of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Luke's Gospel]], and in the [[Beatitudes]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:7|Matthew 5:7]]: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#2:4|Ephesians 2:4]] [[Apostle Paul]] refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: "God, being rich in mercy,... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ".

[[Psalm 117]] calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his "merciful kindness". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:
:''But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.''

This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 &gt;''Mercies Remembered'' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', Book X, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 /&gt;

In the encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' ("Rich in Mercy") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy.&lt;ref name=Dives&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II. ''Dives in misericordia'', November 30, 1980, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:11|Luke 15:11-32]]) "the essence of the divine mercy".&lt;ref name=Dives/&gt; Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 &gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catechism2447 &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]'': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Kyrie Eleison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]]. Since the [[Middle Ages]], many representations in art encouraged people to practice the [[works of mercy]] and, as the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains using the example of [[Caravaggio]], helped "the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref name=Withyou548 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.&lt;ref name=Ball175 &gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Pope John Paul II]] was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint [[Mary Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938), who is known as the ''[[Faustina Kowalska|Apostle of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;''Saints of the Jubilee'' by Tim Drake 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Roman Catholic [[shrines]] are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.
the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krakow)|Basilica of Divine Mercy]] in Krakow Poland, and the [[National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061997_sr-faustina_en.html Vatican website: Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|the Diary of Faustina]] and called mercy the "greatest attribute of God Almighty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy_en.html  Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''World Apostolic Congress on Mercy'' was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407083540/http://www.zenit.org/article-22184?l=english |title=Zenit April 2, 2008 |date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080408194854/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0801799.htm |title=Catholic News Service, APril 3, 2008 |date=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April, 2015, at St. Peter's Basillica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ("The Face of Mercy"), [[Pope Francis]] proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus [[Christ the King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/papa-francesco_bolla_20150411_misericordiae-vultus.html Pope Francis, ''Misericordiae Vultus'', April 11, 2015, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee is taken from Luke 6:36, "Merciful, Like the Father".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-declares-2016-to-be-a-jubilee-for-mercy-84325/ Harris, Elise. "Pope Francis declares Holy Year for Mercy", Catholic News Agency, March 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the title "Most Merciful" (al-Rahman) is one of the [[names of Allah]] and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the [[Quran]]. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence.&lt;ref name=Rafiabadi &gt;''World religions and Islam: a critical study, Part 1'' by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, 2003 Sarup and Sons Publishers {{ISBN|81-7625-414-2}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of mercy, the giving of alms ([[zakat]]) is the fourth of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] and one of the requirements for the faithful.&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, Richard (July 14, 1999). "arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion". Washington State University. {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The Hebrew word  for mercy is ''Rachamim'' which is always in plural form so that it literally means "mercies". "Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shema.com/gods-attributes-the-mercy-of-god-3043/ Rabbi Loren. "God’s Attributes: The Mercy of God", Congregation Shema Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy is one of the defining characteristics of [[God]]. Exodus 34:6 says: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;''After the exile'' by John Barton, David James Reimer 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-524-3}} page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: "For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8) 

When [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 24:14, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guan Yin: goddess of compassion'' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described God as being "all-merciful and eternally benevolent" in his [[Parvardigar Prayer|O Parvardigar]] prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the "invocation of His mercy."&lt;ref&gt; Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher''. '''18'''. Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc. p. 5986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIRIAM''' (Minimum Information Required In The Annotation of Models&lt;ref&gt;The original article used the verb "requested", but this has evolved through community use into "required", and is in line with other Minimum Information (MI) standards available through the MIBBI portal&lt;/ref&gt;) is a community-level effort to standardize  the annotation and curation processes of quantitative models of biological systems.&lt;ref name="pmid16333295"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1156 |title=Minimum information requested in the annotation of biochemical models (MIRIAM) |year=2005 |last1=Novère |first1=Nicolas Le |last2=Finney |first2=Andrew |last3=Hucka |first3=Michael |last4=Bhalla |first4=Upinder S |last5=Campagne |first5=Fabien |last6=Collado-Vides |first6=Julio |last7=Crampin |first7=Edmund J |last8=Halstead |first8=Matt |last9=Klipp |first9=Edda |last10=Mendes |first10=Pedro |last11=Nielsen |first11=Poul |last12=Sauro |first12=Herbert |last13=Shapiro |first13=Bruce |last14=Snoep |first14=Jacky L |last15=Spence |first15=Hugh D |last16=Wanner |first16=Barry L |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1509–15 |pmid=16333295|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a set of guidelines suitable for use with any structured format, allowing different groups to collaborate and share resulting models. Adherence to these guidelines also facilitates the sharing of software and service infrastructures built upon modeling activities.

The idea of "a set of good practices" including "some obligatory metadata" was first proposed by Nicolas Le Novère in October 2004 as part of a discussion to develop a common database of models in systems biology (which led to the creation of [[BioModels Database]]). These initial ideas were further refined at a meeting in Heidelberg, during [[International Conference on Systems Biology|ICSB]] 2004, with representatives from many other interested groups.

'''MIRIAM''' is a registered project of the MIBBI (minimum information for biological and biomedical investigations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibbi.org/ Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations{{psc|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MIRIAM Guidelines==

The '''MIRIAM Guidelines''' are composed of three parts, ''reference correspondence'', ''attribution annotation'', and ''external resource annotation'', each of which deals with a different aspect of information that should be included within a model.

===Reference correspondence===

'Reference correspondence' deals with the basic reference information needed to make use of the model, detailing on a gross level the format of the model file, and its instantiability for simulation purposes.

* The model file must be encoded in a public, standardized, machine-readable format ([[SBML]], [[CellML]], [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]], ...).
* The model file must be valid with respect to its encoding schema.
* The model must be associated with a reference description or publication detailing its origin, even if it is a composite.
* The encoded model structure must reflect the (biological) process(es) detailed in the reference description.
* The model must be instantiable; necessary quantitative parameters, such as initial conditions, should be provided if they are needed for a simulation.
* When instantiated, the model must be capable of reproducing representative results as given in the reference description, within an epsilon (algorithms, round-up errors).

===Attribution annotation===

'Attribution annotation' deals with the attribution information that must be embedded within the model file.

* The model must have a name.
* The model must include a citation of the reference description identifying the authors of the model.
* The model must include the name and contact details of the model creators.
* The date and time of model creation and last modification should be specified. A model history is useful but not required.
* The model should be linked to a precise statement about its terms of use and distribution, regardless of whether it is 'free to use' or not.

===External resource annotation===

'External resource annotation' defines the manner in which annotations should be constructed. Those annotations contain references to entities in databases, classifications, ontologies, etc. One of the purposes of annotation is to allow unambiguous identification of the various model components.

* The annotation must unambiguously relate a piece of knowledge to a model constituent.
* The referenced information should be described using a triplet &lt;code&gt;{data collection, collection-specific identifier, optional qualifier}&lt;/code&gt;:
** The annotation should be expressed as a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI).
**  The collection-specific identifier should be analysed within the framework of the data collection.
** Qualifiers (optional) should be used to refine the link between the model components and the referenced information, for example "has_a", "is_version_of" and "is_homolog_to".

More information about the existing qualifiers is available from BioModels.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biomodels.net/qualifiers/ |title=website |publisher=Biomodels.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, annotation is mainly a manual work, so to ensure their longevity the usage of perennial URIs is necessary. It was recognised that the generation of valid and unique URIs for annotation required the creation of a catalogue of shared namespaces for use by the community. This function is provided by the [[MIRIAM Registry]]. The Registry also provides a variety of supporting auxiliary features to enable automated procedures based upon these URIs. The ability to generate resolvable identifiers is provided through the use of the resolving layer, [[Identifiers.org]].

'''NRANK''', or '''National Rank''', is a ranking of the rarity of a [[species]] within a nation.  Each nation can assign their own NRANK, based on information from conservation data centres, natural heritage programmes and expert scientists.

'''nanoDSF''' is a modified [[Thermal Shift Assay|differential scanning fluorimetry]] method to determine [[Protein folding|protein stability]] employing intrinsic [[Fluorescence spectroscopy#Tryptophan fluorescence|tryptophan or tyrosin fluorescence]].&lt;ref name="nanoDSF"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Florian | last1 = Käufl | first2 = Frank | last2 = Rapp | name-list-format = vanc | title = nanoDSF | url = http://www.nanotemper-technologies.com/technologies/nanodsf/  | publisher = NanoTemper Technologies GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nanoDSF2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/new-products/protein-stability-measurement-instrument/5410/ | title = Protein Stability Measurement Instrument | journal = Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News | date = 15 February 2015 | volume = 35 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protein folding|Protein stability]] is typically addressed by thermal or chemical unfolding experiments.&lt;ref name="Unfolding1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Senisterra G, Chau I, Vedadi M | title = Thermal denaturation assays in chemical biology | journal = Assay and Drug Development Technologies | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 128–36 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22066913 | doi = 10.1089/adt.2011.0390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In thermal unfolding experiments, a linear temperature ramp is applied to unfold proteins, whereas chemical unfolding experiments use chemical denaturants in increasing concentrations.
The thermal stability of a protein is typically described by the '[[Melting point|melting temperature]]' or 'Tm', at which 50% of the protein population is unfolded, corresponding to the midpoint of the transition from folded to unfolded.

In contrast to conventional [[Thermal Shift Assay|DSF]] methods, nanoDSF uses tryptophan or tyrosin fluorescence to monitor protein unfolding. Both the fluorescence intensity and the fluorescence maximum strongly depends on the close surroundings of the tryptophan.&lt;ref name="Trp"&gt;{{cite  book | last = Lakowicz | first = Joseph R. | name-list-format = vanc | title=Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy | edition = 3rd | publisher = Springer US | date = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-387-31278-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 350&amp;nbsp;nm and 330&amp;nbsp;nm is suitable to detect any changes in protein structure, for example due to protein unfolding.

Its applications include antibody engineering, [[membrane protein]] research, quality control and [[Pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotemper-technologies.com/get-it-all/application-notes/nanodsf/|title=Application Notes: nanoDSF Technology|| first1 = Florian | last1 = Käufl | first2 = Frank | last2 = Rapp | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = NanoTemper Technologies GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main brain regions that are involved in the regulation of moral cognition and behavior are those of the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Less pronounced areas that are involved in moral regulation include the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Takahashi |first=Hidehiko |last2=Kato |first2=Motoichiro |last3=Matsuura |first3=Masato |last4=Mobbs |first4=Dean |last5=Suhara |first5=Tetsuya |last6=Okubo |first6=Yoshiro |date=2009-02-13 |title=When your gain is my pain and your pain is my gain: neural correlates of envy and schadenfreude |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5916 |pages=937–939 |doi=10.1126/science.1165604 |pmid=19213918 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..937T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Posterior cingulate |posterior cingulate gyrus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Robertson |first=Diana |last2=Snarey |first2=John |last3=Ousley |first3=Opal |last4=Harenski |first4=Keith |last5=DuBois Bowman |first5=F. |last6=Gilkey |first6=Rick |last7=Kilts |first7=Clinton |date=2007-03-02 |title=The neural processing of moral sensitivity to issues of justice and care |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=755–766 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.08.014 |pmid=17174987|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/neuroethics_pubs/44 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insular cortex|anterior insula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hsu |first=Ming |last2=Anen |first2=Cédric |last3=Quartz |first3=Steven R. |date=2008-05-23 |title=The right and the good: distributive justice and neural encoding of equity and efficiency |journal=Science |volume=320 |issue=5879 |pages=1092–1095 |doi=10.1126/science.1153651 |pmid=18467558 |bibcode=2008Sci...320.1092H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic reward pathway]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Alexandre |last2=Collette |first2=Fabienne |last3=Philippot |first3=Pierre |last4=van der Linden |first4=Martial |last5=Laureys |first5=Steven |last6=Delfiore |first6=Guy |last7=Degueldre |first7=Christian |last8=Maquet |first8=Pierre |last9=Luxen |first9=Andre |date=2003-04-01 |title=Neural correlates of "hot" and "cold" emotional processing: a multilevel approach to the functional anatomy of emotion |journal=NeuroImage |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=938–949 |pmid=12725769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of investigation==
To analyze the neuromoral circuit scientists perform experimental paradigms utilizing [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and tasks that assess [[moral reasoning]] and [[Moral Judgement Interview|judgment]]. One method includes the administration of [[Ethical dilemma|moral dilemmas]] to subjects, in the form of anecdotes, while their brain activity is measured by fMRI.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another approach includes the presentation of emotionally charged moral or immoral scenes and images to subjects while their brain activity is measured by [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, measuring [[Biological neural network|neuronal assembly]] activity during personal and impersonal [[Ethical dilemma|moral dilemmas]] has also been a method of investigating morality at the brain level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the pathological approach investigates tissue abnormalities in the neuromoral network and links them to potential cognitive and behavioral deficits.

==Functional order==
Normal functioning of the neuromoral network involves specific patterns of activity when performing moral tasks. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is the hub of the neuromoral circuit allowing for the processing of morally charged stimuli and the subsequent generation of states such as [[empathy]], [[Charity (practice)|charitableness]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moll |first=Jorge |last2=de Oliveira-Souza |first2=Ricardo |date=2007-08-01 |title=Moral judgments, emotions and the utilitarian brain |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=319–321 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.06.001 |pmid=17602852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harenski |first=Carla L. |last2=Hamann |first2=Stephan |date=2006-03-01 |title=Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations |journal=NeuroImage |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=313–324 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.034 |pmid=16249098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Decety |first=Jean |last2=Jackson |first2=Philip L. |date=2004-06-01 |title=The functional architecture of human empathy |journal=Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=71–100 |doi=10.1177/1534582304267187 |pmid=15537986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex allows for the integration of those states, subsequent moral reasoning, and generation of the ability to override emotional states relating to morality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex allows for the processing of moral or immoral behaviors performed by others allowing for mapping and imitation of the observed behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shamay-Tsoory |first=Simone G. |last2=Aharon-Peretz |first2=Judith |last3=Perry |first3=Daniella |date=2009-03-01 |title=Two systems for empathy: a double dissociation between emotional and cognitive empathy in inferior frontal gyrus versus ventromedial prefrontal lesions |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology |volume=132 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=617–627 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn279 |pmid=18971202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Iacoboni |first=Marco |last2=Mazziotta |first2=John C. |date=2007-09-01 |title=Mirror neuron system: basic findings and clinical applications |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=213–218 |doi=10.1002/ana.21198 |pmid=17721988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fabbri-Destro |first=Maddalena |last2=Rizzolatti |first2=Giacomo |date=2008-06-01 |title=Mirror neurons and mirror systems in monkeys and humans |journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.) |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=171–179 |doi=10.1152/physiol.00004.2008 |pmid=18556470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amygdala allows for sensory recognition of non-integrated emotional stimuli that are channeled to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for moral indexing and processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The mesolimbic reward pathway has been implicated with the generation of pleasurable feelings when a non-moral act is performed towards a hostile entity, a phenomenon called [[Schadenfreude]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cingulate cortex allows for conflict regulation when performing an immoral action and the feeling of envy when self identified entities are overcome by non identified ones.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In [[architecture]], the [[latin]] term '''''opus''''' ("work) is a word that generically indicates various techniques of constructing [[buildings]] that were in use in [[ancient Rome]]. Usually the word ''opus'' is not used alone in building descriptions, but is paired with specific attributes (''incertum'', ''latericium'', etc.), whose purpose is to show precisely the building technique that was used (i.e. ''[[opus incertum]]'', ''[[opus latericium]]'', ''[[opus reticulatum]]'', ''[[opus mixtum]]'', etcetera).

==Practice==
[[File:Wiki-fellatio.png|thumb|Female performing fellatio]]
Oral sex may be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]].

===Sexual variants===
[[Facesitting]] is a form of oral sex in which the receiver sits on the giver's face and pushes into it with his or her genitals. Oral sex can also be performed by both partners at the same time in the so-called [[69 (sex position)|"sixty-nine" position]]. Spitting and/or swallowing of the ejaculatory fluids or giving a [[Pearl necklace (sexuality)|pearl necklace]] may cause different sexual stimulations. [[Autofellatio]] is a possible but rare variant; [[autocunnilingus]] may also be possible for women with extremely flexible spines.

An act of [[group sex]] restricted to one woman giving oral sex to several men is referred to as a ''gangsuck'', ''blowbang'' or ''lineup'', all derivatives of the slang term ''[[gang bang]]'' for group sex. [[Bukkake (sex act)|Bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] may also involve oral sex.

===Preserving virginity===
[[File:ChinaScrollPN3 detail, left, threesome.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A late 19th century [[Beijing]] [[hand scroll]] depicting oral sex]]

Oral sex is commonly used as a means of preserving [[virginity]], especially among heterosexual pairings; this is sometimes termed ''[[technical virginity]]'' (which additionally includes [[anal sex]], [[mutual masturbation]] and other [[non-penetrative sex]] acts, but excludes [[Sexual intercourse|penile-vaginal sex]]).&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ken Plummer | title = Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2002| pages = 1920–1921 | accessdate = August 24, 2013|isbn =1134922426 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liUcCPXcpAAC&amp;pg=PA1920|quote=The social construction of 'sex' as vaginal intercourse affects how other forms of sexual activity are evaluated as sexually satisfying or arousing; in some cases whether an activity is seen as a sexual act at all.

Oral sex is not necessarily an effective method of preventing [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), although some forms of STIs are believed to be less commonly spread in this way, and oral sex has been recommended as a form of [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name="testing"&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/health/testing/geffen_sti.html Geffen Testing Center's HIV, Syphilis, and Hepatitis C Information Sheet].

Oral sex should be limited to the protected areas. A makeshift dental dam can be made out of a [[condom]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/dental-dams "How to Make a Dental Dam Using a Condom"], UCSB SexInfoOnline, February 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or a latex or [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile glove]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://std.about.com/od/prevention/ht/dentaldamhowto.htm|title=How to Make Your Own Dental Dam From a Condom|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but using a real dental dam is seen as preferable; this is because real dental dams cover a larger area, avoid accidents caused by "slipping" outside the covered area, and avoid the risk that makeshift versions may be accidentally damaged or poked with the scissors during the cutting procedure. Plastic wrap may also be used as a barrier during oral sex, but there exists no conclusive scientific research regarding how effective it may or may not be at preventing disease transmission. Certain kinds of plastic wrap are manufactured to be microwaveable and are designed to have pores that open when heated, but there also exists no scientific research on what effect, if any, this has on disease transmission when used during oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/saferse1/a/plastic-wrap-oral-sex.htm|title=Plastic Wrap and Oral Sex|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people complain that the thickness of the plastic dulls sensation.

===Prevalence===
A report issued in September 2005 by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] was the basis of an article in the September 26, 2005 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. The report comes from the results of a computer-administered [[statistical survey|survey]] of over 12,000 Americans between the ages of 15 and 44, and states that over half the teenagers questioned have had oral sex. While some headlines have interpreted this as evidence that oral sex among teenagers is "on the rise", this was the first comprehensive study of its kind to examine the matter.&lt;ref name="lemonick"&gt;Lemonick, Michael D., [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1106324,00.html "A Teen Twist on Sex"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', New York, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) stated in 2009: "Studies indicate that oral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents."&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Research also indicates that "males are more likely than females to have received oral sex, whereas equal proportions of men and women have given oral sex."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

==Health risks and other studies==

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web| title = Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)| year = 2008| accessdate = December 6, 2011|url =https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/surv2008-Complete.pdf}} Also see [https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats08/2008survFactSheet.PDF Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Pratt| title = HIV &amp; AIDS: A Foundation for Nursing and Healthcare Practice | publisher = [[CRC Press]]|pages=306| isbn = 0340706392|year=2003| accessdate = August 21, 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=naSG-2RgRiYC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and Society, Volume 1|isbn =0761479066|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|year=2009–2010|page=61|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his or her genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt; Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after performing oral sex can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of the aforementioned factors, medical sources advise the use of [[condom]]s or [[Safe sex#Barrier protection|other effective barrier methods]] when performing or receiving oral sex with a partner whose STI status is unknown.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===HPV and oral cancer link===
Links have been reported between oral sex and [[oral cancer]] with human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected people. In 2005, a research study at [[Malmö University]]'s Faculty of Odontology suggested that performing unprotected oral sex on a person infected with HPV might increase the risk of oral cancer. The study found that 36 percent of the [[cancer]] patients had HPV compared to only 1 percent of the healthy control group.

Another study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' suggests a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between oral sex and [[head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV, a virus that has been implicated in the majority of cervical cancers and which has been detected in throat cancer tissue in numerous studies. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity and those with more than five oral sex partners had a 250 percent increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'Souza G |title=Case-control study of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer |journal=N.

===Miscarriage reduction===
Fellatio may reduce the risk of [[miscarriage]]s by inducing [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|immunological tolerance]] in the woman by exposure to the proteins in her partner's semen, a process known as [[paternal tolerance]]. While any exposure to a partner's semen appears to decrease a woman's chances for the various immunological disorders that can occur during pregnancy, immunological tolerance could be most quickly established through the oral introduction and gastrointestinal absorption of semen.&lt;ref name="pmid10706945"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koelman CA, Coumans AB, Nijman HW, Doxiadis II, Dekker GA, Claas FH |title=Correlation between oral sex and a low incidence of preeclampsia: a role for soluble HLA in seminal fluid? |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10706945 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(99)00062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite news | last=Fox | first=Douglas | title=Gentle Persuasion | publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''| date=February 9, 2002 | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323294.200-gentle-persuasion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that some of the studies potentially included the presence of confounding factors, such as the possibility that women who regularly perform fellatio and swallow semen also engage in more frequent intercourse, the researchers also noted that, either way, "the data still overwhelmingly supports the main theory" behind all their studies—that repeated exposure to semen establishes the maternal immunological tolerance necessary for a safe and successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP |title=Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis |journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=253–265 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896827 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
[[File:Fellatio.png|thumb|right|275px|[[Fellatio]] in [[69 (sex position)|69 position]] ]]
{{See also|Cunnilingus|Fellatio}}

Cultural views on oral sex range from aversion to high regard.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; It, especially fellatio,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html "The History of Fellatio"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143842/http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/05/22/oral_history/print.html |date=May 24, 2006 }}, ''Salon.com'', May 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; has been considered [[taboo]], or at least discouraged, in many cultures and parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Laws of some jurisdictions regard oral sex as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative sex]] for the purposes of [[Sex and the law|sexual offenses]] with regard to the act, but most countries do not have laws which ban the practice itself, in contrast to anal sex or [[extramarital sex]].

In [[Ancient Rome]], fellatio was considered profoundly taboo.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/priap/prp105.htm |title=Irrumation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual acts were generally seen through the prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two [[Latin]] words for the act: ''irrumare'' (to penetrate orally), and ''fellare'' (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it was considered to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have [[Halitosis|foul breath]] and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.&lt;ref name="Irrumation"/&gt;

In contrast to historical views on fellatio, cunnilingus is revered as a spiritually fulfilling practice in Chinese [[Taoism]], which regards it as having the ability to enhance [[longevity]].&lt;ref&gt;Octavio Paz (1969) ''Conjunctions and Disjunctions''; trans. Helen R. Lane. London: Wildwood House; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[Western culture]], oral sex is widely practiced among adolescents&lt;ref name="lemonick"/&gt; and adults.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

People give various reasons for their dislike of oral sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Some state that since it does not result in reproduction, it is therefore unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buschmiller|first=Rev. Robert|title=Oral Sex in Marriage|url=http://www.presentationministries.com/brochures/OralSex.asp|publisher=Presentation Ministries|accessdate=November 22, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206194539/http://www.presentationministries.com/publications/OralSex.asp|archivedate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find it less intimate because it is not a face-to-face practice,&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; or believe that it is a humiliating or unclean practice;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pina"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2804438|last=Pina-Cabral|first=Joao de|title=Tamed Violence: Genital Symbolism is Portuguese popular culture|journal=Man|year=1992|volume=28|issue=1|series=N.S|pages=101–120|jstor=2804438}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is humiliating or unclean are opinions that are, at least in some cases, connected with the symbolism attached to different parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Pina"/&gt; Opposite these views, people also believe that oral sex "is one of the most intimate behaviors that a couple can engage in because it requires total trust and vulnerability."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

While commonly believed that [[lesbian sexual practices]] involve cunnilingus for all [[women who have sex with women]] (WSW), some have an aversion to cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean.&lt;ref name="Belge"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy|last=Belge|title=Do All Lesbians Like Oral Sex?|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2012|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiansex/f/DoAllLesbiansLikeOral.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCormick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi B.

==Terminology and slang==
There are many words which refer to oral sex, including [[euphemism]]s and [[sexual slang]]. Like all aspects of sexuality, there exists a large number of variations on a theme, a few common ones being:

* Giving head – A common slang term for giving oral sex to either a man or woman is ''giving head'', from the term ''head job'' (in contrast to ''[[hand job]]'', manual stimulation). A play on the slang term ''head'' resulted in the slang term ''brains'', or ''brain salad surgery'', ''domes'' or ''getting domes.''
* Plate – A once common [[British English|British]] [[rhyming slang]] for ''fellate'' that arose in the gay slang language of [[Polari]] that spread in the 1960s. The term is less common today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ Polari]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422181306/http://voodooverse.wordpress.com/polari-baskets-abound/ |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cunnilingus is also sometimes referred to as ''muff diving'', ''eating out'' or ''poon-job'', a slang term and a cunnilingus variant of ''[[blow job]]'', where ''poon'' is short for ''poontang'' or ''punani''.
* Additionally, in lesbian culture, several common slang terms used are ''carpet munching'', ''giving lip'', ''lip service'' or ''[[Tipping the Velvet|tipping the velvet]]'' (a faux-"Victorian" expression invented by novelist [[Sarah Waters]]).

Other slang terms for oral sex include ''going down on'' (male or female), ''licking out'' and ''muff diving'' (female), ''blow job'' (male), ''dome'' (male or female), ''sucking off'' (male), ''playing the skin flute'' (male recipient), ''rolling cigars'' (male recipient), ''lolly-gagging'' (gay male-on-male), ''gaining knowledge'' (male recipient) and ''bust down'' (male). Forced fellatio is often called ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized religion, or institutional religion, is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Molnar, Darin R., PhD|title= Three Worldviews|date= 9 December 2010|url= http://www.middlewaymanagement.com/three-worldviews/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].

Organized religion is distinguished from the broader idea of [[religion]] especially in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]]. American philosopher [[William James]] states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion... shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude... in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, William|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 31|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; James further comments that the essential elements of "institutional religion" are "[[worship]] and [[sacrifice]], procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity [i.e.] [[theology]], and [[ceremony]] and [[Clergy|ecclesiastical organization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, Williams|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 30|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized religion seems to have gained prevalence since the [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]] with the rise of wide-scale [[civilization]] and [[History of agriculture|agriculture]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} Organized religions may include a [[state religion|state's official religion]], or [[state church]]. However, most political states have any number of organized religions practiced within their jurisdiction. Due to their structured, standardized, and easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's [[major religious groups]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} The [[Abrahamic religion]]s are all largely considered organized (including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]), as well as some schools of thought within [[Indian religion]]s (for example, some schools of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Religions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many [[indigenous religion|indigenous]] and [[folk religion]]s, such as [[traditional African religion]]s, [[Native American religion]]s and [[prehistoric religion]]s, as well as personal religions including some strands of [[Hinduism]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Modern views==
In the modern era, the definition of the term 'religion' is becoming increasingly opaque, making the task of defining 'organised religion' difficult. Anthropologists, theologians and scholars have thus attempt to embed the idea of an 'organisation' into the definition of religion itself. Some examples of this are found in the definition provided by Clifford Geertz, who defines religion as a "Cultural system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=V86CXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=geertz+religion+as+a+cultural+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn7Y_ukYXdAhUVdt4KHb6_AHQQ6AEIKTAA|title=Religion as a Cultural System|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|date=1966|publisher=Tavistock|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Max Weber's prominent definition of a religion includes the idea of a 'Church,' not necessarily in the Christian formulation, but insisting on the notion of an organised hierarchy constituting a palpable religious body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=abS61el-VEMC&amp;dq=Weber+definition+of+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQvKSJkoXdAhUXfd4KHecABDsQ6AEILDAA|title=The Sociology of Religion|last=Weber|first=Max|date=1993|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807042052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it becomes apparent that 'organised religion' has also been considered as part of the definition of religion itself, which in the modern era has caused a degree of controversy with the prominence of aforementioned personalized faith systems.

'''Particulate pollution''' is [[pollution]] of an [[Biophysical environment|environment]] that consists of [[particle]]s suspended in some medium. There are three primary forms: [[atmospheric particulate matter]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, [[marine debris]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, and [[space debris]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Some particles are released directly from a specific source, while others form in [[Chemical reaction|chemical reactions]] in the atmosphere. Particulate pollution can be derived from either natural sources or [[anthropogenic]] processes.

==Atmospheric particulate matter==
[[Particulates|Atmospheric particulate matter]], also known as [[particulate matter]], or PM, describes solids and/or liquid particles suspended in a gas, most commonly the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrino|first=Cinzia|date=2010|title=Atmospheric particulate matter|url=https://laboratoriocritico.uniroma1.it/index.php/CISB-BBL/article/view/8876|journal=Biophysics and Bioengineering Letters|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|issn=2037-0199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particles in the atmosphere can be divided into two types, depending on the way they are emitted. Primary particles, such as [[mineral dust]], are emitted into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giere|first=R.|last2=Querol|first2=X.|date=2010|title=Solid Particulate Matter in the Atmosphere|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article-standard/6/4/215/137857/solid-particulate-matter-in-the-atmosphere|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=215–222|doi=10.2113/gselements.6.4.215|issn=1811-5209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary particles, such as [[ammonium nitrate]], are formed in the atmosphere through gas-to-particle conversion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Marine debris==
Marine debris and marine aerosols refer to particulates [[Suspended load|suspended in a liquid]], usually water on the Earth's surface. Particulates in water are a kind of water pollution measured as total [[suspended solids]], a [[water quality]] measurement listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], a [[water quality law]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], sec. 304(a)(4), [[Title 33 of the United States Code|33 U.S.C.]] § 1314(a)(4).&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, some of the same kinds of particles can be suspended both in air and water, and pollutants specifically may be carried in the air and deposited in water, or fall to the ground as [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm|title=Health and Environmental Effects of Particulate Matter (PM) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of marine aerosols are created through the bubble bursting of breaking waves and capillary action on the ocean surface due to the stress exerted from surface winds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuzzi|first=S.|last2=Baltensperger|first2=U.|last3=Carslaw|first3=K.|last4=Decesari|first4=S.|last5=Denier van der Gon|first5=H.|last6=Facchini|first6=M.

==Space debris==
[[Space debris]] describes particulates in the [[vacuum]] of [[outer space]], specifically particles originating from human activity that remain in [[geocentric orbit]] around the [[Earth]]. The International Association of Astronauts define space debris as "any man-made Earth orbiting object which is non-functional with no reasonable expectation of assuming or resuming its intended function or any other function for which it is or can be expected to be authorized, including fragments and parts thereof".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaddha|first=Shane|date=2010|title=Space Debris Mitigation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1586539|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1586539|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Space debris]] is classified by size and operational purpose, and divided into four main subsets: inactive payloads, operational debris, fragmentation debris and microparticulate matter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inactive payloads refer to any launched space objects that have lost the capability to reconnect to its corresponding space operator; thus, preventing a return to Earth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Debris: Legal and Policy Implications|last=Baker|first=H.A.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1989|isbn=0-7923-0166-8|location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, operational debris describes the matter associated with the propulsion of a larger entity into space, which may include upper rocket stages and ejected nose cones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fragmentation debris refers to any object in space that has become dissociated from a larger entity by means of [[explosion]], [[collision]] or [[Wear|deterioration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orbital Debris: A Technical Assessment|last=Committee on Space Debris, National Research Council|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1995|isbn=0309051258|location=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microparticulate matter describes space matter that typically cannot be seen singly with the naked eye, including particles, gases, and spaceglow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response to research that concluded that impacts from Earth orbital debris could lead to greater hazards to spacecraft than the natural meteoroid environment, [[NASA]] began the orbital debris program in 1979, initiated by the Space Sciences branch at [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limiting Future Collision Risk to Spacecraft: An Assessment of NASA's Meteoroid and Orbital Debris Programs|last=|first=|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2011|isbn=0309219779|location=Washington|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with an initial budget of $70,000, the NASA orbital debris program began with the initial goals of characterizing hazards induced by space debris and creating mitigation standards that would minimize the growth of the orbital debris environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orbital Debris: A Chronology|last=D.S.F. Portree|first=J.P. Loftus|publisher=NASA|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the NASA orbital debris program created a debris monitoring program, which included mechanisms to sample the [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) environment for debris as small as 6mm using the [[Haystack Observatory|Haystack X-band]] ground radar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Private Practices: The Story of a Sex Surrogate''''' is a 1985 US [[documentary film]] directed by [[Kirby Dick]] about the interaction between a [[sex surrogate]] and her clients - Dick's first documentary film.

==Synopsis==
''Private Practices'' focuses on [[sex surrogate]] Maureen Sullivan and two of her clients. Kipper, a 25-year-old college student, has had little sexual experience with women and seeks help overcoming his shyness. John, a 45-year-old divorcee, believes that his sexual inadequacies are preventing him from finding a new partner. Sullivan works with these men in an attempt to improve their body image, relationship skills, and sexual satisfaction.

The film also shows how these patients interact with their friends, family members, and therapists. Many scenes focus on Sullivan, who discusses her history as a surrogate and describes her own relationship difficulties. In one scene, she and her brother confront their father about his abusive behavior and unwillingness to accept Maureen's career choice.

The filmmakers paid for the patients' therapy in exchange for permission to record their sessions. In order to preserve the therapeutic atmosphere, Dick only allowed a single camera operator to be in the room during each session, and he and the rest of the crew monitored the filming from a remote station in a different room.&lt;ref&gt;''Private Practices'' DVD commentary track&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the film crew does not directly interact with the subjects during therapy, and the subjects rarely comment on the presence of the filmmakers.

A postscript to the film states that John and Kipper have gone on to form more successful relationships, while Sullivan has started dating and reduced her number of patients.

==Reception==
''Private Practices'' won favorable reviews from critics. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Edward Guthmann called it "an honest, courageous and sensitive study of human beings in their most vulnerable moments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The film received awards for Best Documentary at the 1985 [[USA Film Festival]] and 1985 [[Atlanta Film Festival]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Sculptured stones''' is a name applied to commemorative monuments of [[early Christian]] date found in various parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]].

They are usually rough-hewn slabs or boulders, and in a few cases well-shaped crosses, bearing lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on [[Celt]]ic scriptures of the [[Gospels]]. Their lettered inscriptions are in [[Latin]], [[Ogam]] or [[Viking|Scandinavian]] and [[Angles|Anglican]] [[runes]], while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland]] are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pictishstones.org.uk/

'''Self-perpetuation''', the capability of something to cause itself to continue to [[existence|exist]], is one of the main characteristics of [[life]]. [[Organism]]s' capability of [[reproduction]] leads to self-perpetuation of the species, if not to the individual. [[Population]]s self-perpetuate and grow. Entire [[ecosystem]]s show [[homeostasis]], and thus perpetuate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hilgardia|volume=39|issue=13|pages=367–404|doi=10.3733/hilg.v39n13p367|year=1968|title=Mechanisms of population homeostasis in Anagasta ecosystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Population homeostasis
|author=Koeslag JH.
|journal=S Afr Med J
|year=1978
|volume=53
|issue=6
|pages=222–4.
|pmid=653514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slow modifying effect of [[succession (ecology)|succession]] and similar shifts in the composition of the system can, however, not be neglected in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecol. Appl. |year=2015 |volume=25|issue=8|pages=2051–68|title=The rise of novelty in ecosystems|pmid=26910939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, life's object's capabilities of self-perpetuation are always accompanied by [[evolution]], a perfect [[steady state]] of the biological system is never reached. [[Sexual reproduction]] is also a form of imperfect [[self-replication]] and thus imperfect self-perpetuation because of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] and [[mutation]]. Organisms are not like [[self-replicating machine]] but amass random modifications from generation to generation. The property of self-perpetuation in the strict sense thus only applies to life itself.

In a social context, self-perpetuation is tied to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and (usually) [[positive feedback]] loops:
{{quote|To overcome strong prior [[beliefs]], strong evidence to the contrary is needed. If a person is predisposed to choosing a certain action, the advice from an advisor who sets a low threshold for recommending the alternative action is not of much use. The preference for like-minded advisors who supply coarse information implies that the advice a person receives is likely to
reinforce his existing [[priors]]. This effect can lead to polarisation of opinion and the [[emergence]] of self-serving beliefs. The learning process is prolonged and the induced short run bias can become perpetual if information is costly|Wing Suen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Self-Perpetuation of Biased Beliefs
|author=Wing Suen
|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2004.00213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depending on the time scope or the context, self-perpetuation either depends on [[self-sustainability]], or is equivalent to it. While we may talk about the self-sustainability of an ecosystem, this depends amongst other factor on the self-perpetuation of its constituting species.

In computer science, [[self-reproducing program]]s constitute an incomplete metaphor for self-perpetuation. A better analogue can be seen in [[computer virus]]es which are actually able to self-reproduce - given a suitable computing environment.

}}The '''Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics''' (SECED) was founded in 1969 to promote the study and practice of [[earthquake engineering]] and structural dynamics, including blast, impact and other vibration problems. It also supports study of societal and economic ramifications of major earthquakes.&lt;ref name="SECED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.seced.org.uk/|website=SECED|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the British branch of both the International Association (IAEE) and the European Association of Earthquake Engineering (EAEE).&lt;ref name="PreventionWeb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics (SECED)|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/organizations/13192|website=Prevention Web|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an Associated Society of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE), and is sponsored by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE), the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] (IStructE) and the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]].&lt;ref name="SECED" /&gt;

SECED has organised conferences and lectures (see below). It hosted a 2002 European conference on earthquake engineering in London, and in July 2015 hosted a two-day conference at [[Homerton College]], [[Cambridge]] titled ''Earthquake Risk and Engineering towards a Resilient World''.&lt;ref name="Conf"&gt;{{cite web|title=SECED 2015 Conference|url=https://www.jillrogersassociates.co.uk/seced-home.html|website=Jill Rogers Associates|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also organises regular meetings and has published a newsletter since 1987.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of religion''' is the study of the [[belief]]s, practices and organizational forms of [[religion]] using the tools and methods of the discipline of [[sociology]]. This objective investigation may include the use of both [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]] (surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis) and [[Qualitative research|qualitative approaches]] such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical and documentary materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|title=The Sociological Study of Religion|author=|date=|website=hirr.hartsem.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302152641/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern academic sociology began with the analysis of religion in [[Émile Durkheim]]'s 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] populations, a foundational work of [[social research]] which served to distinguish sociology from other disciplines, such as [[psychology]]. The works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]] emphasized the relationship between religion and the economic or social structure of society. Contemporary debates have centered on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]]. The contemporary sociology of religion may also encompass the sociology of [[irreligion]] (for instance, in the analysis of [[secular humanist]] belief systems).

Sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs. The process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from [[theology]] in assuming indifference to the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of [[Cult (religious practice)|religious practice]].

==View of religion in classical sociology==
Classical, seminal sociological theorists of the late 19th and early 20th century such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Karl Marx]] were greatly interested in [[religion]] and its effects on society. Like those of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] from ancient Greece, and Enlightenment philosophers from the 17th through 19th centuries, the ideas posited by these sociologists continue to be examined today.
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber had very complex and developed theories about the nature and effects of religion. Of these, Durkheim and Weber are often more difficult to understand, especially in light of the lack of context and examples in their primary texts. Religion was considered to be an extremely important social variable in the work of all three.

===Karl Marx===
{{Main|Marxism and religion}}
According to Kevin J. Christiano et al., "Marx was the product of the Enlightenment, embracing its call to replace faith by reason and religion by science." But he "did not believe in science for science's sake … he believed that he was also advancing a theory that would … be a useful tool … [in] effecting a revolutionary upheaval of the capitalist system in favor of [[socialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the crux of his arguments was that humans are best guided by reason. Religion, Marx held, was a significant hindrance to [[reason]], inherently masking the [[truth]] and misguiding followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Settimba|first=Henry|title=Testing times : globalisation and investing theology in East Africa|year=2009|publisher=Author House|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=1-4389-4798-4|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we will later see, [[Marx's theory of alienation|Marx viewed alienation]] as the heart of [[social inequality]]. The antithesis to this [[Social alienation|alienation]] is [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]]. Thus, to propagate freedom means to present individuals with the truth and give them a choice to accept or deny it. In this, "Marx never suggested that religion ought to be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Marx's theories was the oppressive economic situation in which he dwelt. With the rise of [[Industrial Revolution|European industrialism]], Marx and his colleague [[Friedrich Engels]] witnessed and responded to the growth of what he called "[[surplus value]]". Marx's view of capitalism saw rich capitalists getting richer and their workers getting poorer (the gap, the exploitation, was the "surplus value"). Not only were workers getting exploited, but in the process they were being further detached from the products they helped create. By simply selling their work for [[wage]]s, "workers simultaneously lose connection with the object of labor and become objects themselves. Workers are devalued to the level of a commodity{{spaced ndash}}a thing …"&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; From this [[objectification]] comes alienation. The common worker is led to believe that he or she is a replaceable tool, and is alienated to the point of extreme discontent. Here, in Marx's eyes, religion enters. Capitalism utilizes our tendency towards religion as a tool or [[ideological state apparatus]] to justify this alienation. Christianity teaches that those who gather up riches and power in this life will almost certainly not be rewarded in the next ("it is harder for a rich man to enter the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] than it is for a camel to pass through the [[eye of a needle]] …") while those who suffer [[oppression]] and poverty in this life, while cultivating their spiritual wealth, will be rewarded in the Kingdom of God. Hence Marx's famous line – "[[Opium of the people|religion is the opium of the people]]", as it soothes them and dulls their senses to the pain of oppression. Some scholars have recently noted that this is a contradictory (or dialectical) metaphor, referring to religion as both an expression of suffering and a protest against suffering.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15–38. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818030414/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Émile Durkheim===
Émile Durkheim placed himself in the [[positivism|positivist]] tradition, meaning that he thought of his study of society as dispassionate and scientific. He was deeply interested in the problem of what held complex modern societies together. Religion, he argued, was an expression of social cohesion.

In the fieldwork that led to his famous ''[[Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'', Durkheim, a [[secularism|secular]] Frenchman, looked at anthropological data of [[Indigenous Australians]]. His underlying interest was to understand the basic forms of religious life for all societies. In ''Elementary Forms'', Durkheim argues that the [[totem]]s the Aborigines venerate are actually expressions of their own conceptions of society itself. This is true not only for the Aborigines, he argues, but for all societies.

Religion, for Durkheim, is not "imaginary", although he does deprive it of what many believers find essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bellah |first=Robert Nelly |date=1973 |title=Emile Durkheim: on morality and society |url= |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=191 |isbn= 9780226173368 |author-link=Robert Neelly Bellah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is very real; it is an expression of society itself, and indeed, there is no society that does not have religion. We perceive as individuals a force greater than ourselves, which is our social life, and give that perception a [[supernatural]] face. We then express ourselves religiously in groups, which for Durkheim makes the [[symbolic power]] greater. Religion is an expression of our collective consciousness, which is the fusion of all of our individual consciousnesses, which then creates a reality of its own.

It follows, then, that less complex societies, such as the Australian Aborigines, have less complex religious systems, involving totems associated with particular [[clan]]s. The more complex a particular society, the more complex the religious system is. As societies come in contact with other societies, there is a tendency for religious systems to emphasize [[universalism]] to a greater and greater extent. However, as the [[division of labour]] makes the individual seem more important (a subject that Durkheim treats extensively in his famous ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]''), religious systems increasingly focus on individual [[salvation]] and [[conscience]].

Durkheim's [[definition of religion]], from ''Elementary Forms'', is as follows: "A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden – beliefs and practices which unite into one single [[moral community]] called a Church, all those who adhere to them."&lt;ref name="Swain"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915)'']: Translated by Joseph Ward Swain, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; This is a functional definition of religion, meaning that it explains what religion ''does'' in social life: essentially, it unites societies. Durkheim defined religion as a clear distinction between the [[sacred–profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]], in effect this can be paralleled with the distinction between [[God]] and humans.

This definition also does not stipulate what exactly may be considered [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]]. Thus later sociologists of religion (notably [[Robert Neelly Bellah]]) have extended Durkheimian insights to talk about notions of [[civil religion]], or the religion of a state. [[American civil religion]], for example, might be said to have its own set of sacred "things": the [[flag of the United States]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], etc. Other sociologists have taken Durkheim's concept of what religion is in the direction of the religion of professional sports, the military, or of rock music.

===Max Weber===
Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and his rationalization thesis: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920).

In his sociology, Weber uses the German term "[[Verstehen]]" to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action. Weber is not a [[positivism|positivist]]; he does not believe we can find out "facts" in sociology that can be causally linked. Although he believes some generalized statements about social life can be made, he is not interested in hard positivist claims, but instead in linkages and sequences, in historical narratives and particular cases.

Weber argues for making sense of religious action on its own terms. A religious group or individual is influenced by all kinds of things, he says, but if they claim to be acting in the name of religion, we should attempt to understand their [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] on religious grounds first. Weber gives religion credit for shaping a person's image of the world, and this image of the world can affect their view of their interests, and ultimately how they decide to take action.

For Weber, religion is best understood as it responds to the human need for [[theodicy]] and [[soteriology]]. Human beings are troubled, he says, with the question of theodicy – the question of how the extraordinary power of a [[divinity|divine]] god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over. People need to know, for example, why there is undeserved good fortune and suffering in the world. Religion offers people soteriological answers, or answers that provide opportunities for [[salvation]] – relief from suffering, and reassuring meaning. The pursuit of salvation, like the pursuit of wealth, becomes a part of human [[motivation]].

Because religion helps to define motivation, Weber believed that religion (and specifically [[Calvinism]]) actually helped to give rise to modern capitalism, as he asserted in his most famous and controversial work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

In ''The Protestant Ethic'', Weber argues that capitalism arose in Europe in part because of how the [[belief]] in [[predestination]] was interpreted by everyday English [[Puritan]]s. Puritan theology was based on the Calvinist notion that not everyone would be saved; there was only a specific number of the elect who would avoid [[damnation]], and this was based sheerly on God's predetermined will and not on any action you could perform in this life. Official doctrine held that one could not ever really know whether one was among the elect.

Practically, Weber noted, this was difficult psychologically: people were (understandably) anxious to know whether they would be eternally damned or not. Thus Puritan leaders began assuring members that if they began doing well financially in their businesses, this would be one unofficial sign they had God's approval and were among the saved – but only if they used the fruits of their labour well. This along with the [[rationalism]] implied by [[monotheism]] led to the development of rational bookkeeping and the calculated pursuit of financial success beyond what one needed simply to live – and this is the "spirit of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon (2010) "Elective Affinities of the Protestant Ethic: Weber and the Chemistry of Capitalism" Sociological Theory vol 28 no. 1. pages 108–126. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the habits associated with the spirit of capitalism lost their religious significance, and the rational pursuit of [[Profit (economics)|profit]] became an aim in its own right.

''The Protestant Ethic'' thesis has been much critiqued, refined, and disputed, but is still a lively source of theoretical debate in sociology of religion. Weber also did considerable work on world religions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

In his ''magnum opus'' ''[[Economy and Society]]'' Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of religious attitudes:&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
# world-flying mysticism
# world-rejecting asceticism
# inner-worldly asceticism.

He also separated [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] as pre-religious activity.

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Symbolic anthropology and phenomenology===
[[Symbolic anthropology]] and some versions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] argue that all humans require reassurance that the world is safe and ordered place – that is, they have a need for [[ontological security]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age, Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all societies have forms of knowledge that perform this psychological task. The inability of science to offer psychological and emotional comfort explains the presence and influence of non-scientific knowledge in human lives, even in rational world.

===Functionalism===
Unlike [[symbolic anthropology]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] points to the benefits for social organization which non-scientific belief systems provide and which scientific knowledge fails to deliver. Belief systems are seen as encouraging social order and social stability in ways that rationally based knowledge cannot. From this perspective, the existence of non-rational accounts of reality can be explained by the benefits they offer to society.

According to functionalists, "religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control. … One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and social networking, offering a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter-15-religion/ |title=Religion |last=McGivern |first=Ron |date= |website=Introduction to Sociology – 1st Canadian Edition |publisher=BC Open Textbooks |access-date=2018-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
Rationalists object to the phenomenological and functionalist approaches, arguing that they fail to understand why believers in systems of non-scientific knowledge do think they tell the truth and that their ideas are right, even when science has shown them to be wrong. We cannot explain forms of knowledge in terms of the beneficial psychological or societal effects that an outside observer may see them as producing. We have to look at the point of view of those who believe in them. People do not believe in God, practice magic, or think that witches cause misfortune because they think they are providing themselves with psychological reassurance, or to achieve greater cohesion for their social groups. They do so because they think their beliefs are correct – that they tell them the truth about the way the world is.

Nineteenth-century rationalist writers, reflecting the evolutionist spirits of their times, tended to explain the lack of rationality and the dominance of false beliefs in pre-modern worlds in terms of the deficient mental equipment of their inhabitants. Such people were seen as possessing pre-logical, or non-rational, mentality. Twentieth-century rationalist thinking generally rejected such a view, reasoning that pre-modern people didn't possess inferior minds, but lacked the social and cultural conditions needed to promote rationalism. Rationalists see the history of modern societies as the rise of scientific knowledge and the subsequent decline of non-rational belief. Some of these beliefs, such as magic and [[witchcraft]], had disappeared, while others, such as religion, had become marginalized. This rationalist perspective has led to [[secularization]] theories of various kinds.&lt;ref name="Wilson1982" /&gt;

==Typology of religious groups==
{{Main|Sociological classifications of religious movements}}
One common typology among sociologists, religious groups are classified as [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesias]], [[religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, or [[cult]]s (now more commonly referred to in scholarship as [[new religious movement]]s). Note that sociologists give these words precise definitions which differ from how they are commonly used. In particular, sociologists use the words 'cult' and 'sect' without negative connotations, even though the popular use of these words is often pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
Some sociologists of religion explore the theoretical analysis of the sociological dimensions of [[religiosity]]. For example, [[Charles Y. Glock]] is best known for his five-dimensional scheme of the nature of religious commitment. His list consist of the following variables: [[religious belief|belief]], [[religious education|knowledge]], [[religious experience|experience]], [[practice (social theory)|practice]] (sometimes subdivided into private and public [[ritual]]) and [[consequences of religiosity|consequences]]. Glock's first four dimensions have proved widely useful in research, because generally, they are simple to measure survey research.&lt;ref name="hartsem.edu"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |chapter=Glock, Charles Young |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |publisher=Hartford Institute for Religion Research |first=Armand L. |last=Mauss |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011221304/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |archivedate=2013-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Mervin F. Verbit]]'s contribution was a twenty four-dimensional religiosity measure which includes measuring religiosity through six different "components" of religiosity: [[ritual]], [[doctrine]], [[emotion]], [[knowledge]], [[ethics]], [[community]], and along four dimensions: content, frequency, intensity, centrality.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M.

==Secularization and civil religion==
{{Main|Secularization|Civil religion}}

In relation to the processes of rationalization associated with the development of [[modernity]], it was predicted in the works of many classical sociologists that religion would decline.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davie|first=Grace|title=Predicting religion: Christian, Peculiar &amp; alternative Future|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-3010-4|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists immediately after [[World War II]], many contemporary theorists have critiqued secularization thesis, arguing that religion has continued to play a vital role in the lives of individuals worldwide. In the United States, in particular, [[church attendance]] has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years. In Africa, the emergence of [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] has occurred at a high rate. While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cragun|first=Ryan|title=Introduction To Sociology|year=2008|publisher=Seven Treasures Publications|isbn=978-0-9800707-7-4|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of [[Islam]] as a major world religion, especially its new-found influence in the [[Western world|West]], is another significant development. {{citation needed span|text=Furthermore, arguments may be presented regarding the concept of civil religion and new world belief systems.|date=June 2018}} In short, presupposed secularization as a decline in religiosity might seem to be a myth, depending on its definition and the definition of its scope. For instance, some sociologists have argued that steady church attendance and personal religious belief may coexist with a decline in the influence of religious authorities on social or political issues. Additionally, regular attendance or affiliation do not necessarily translate into a behaviour according to their doctrinal teachings.

In other words, numbers of members might still be growing, but this does not mean that all members are faithfully following the rules of pious behaviours expected. In that sense, religion may be seen as declining because of its waning ability to influence behaviour.

===Religious economy===
According to [[Rodney Stark]], [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] was the first contemporary sociologist to reject the secularization theory outright. Martin even proposed that the concept of secularization be eliminated from social scientific discourse, on the grounds that it had only served ideological purposes and because there was no evidence of any general shift from a religious period in human affairs to a secular period.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. "Secularization, R.I.P." ''Sociology of religion 60'', no. 3 (1999): 249–273.&lt;/ref&gt;
Stark is well known for pioneering, with [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[theory of religious economy]], according to which societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed [[state religion|state religious monopoly]] or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the older view of secularization which states that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then the population is less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context, leading to a reduction in religious observance.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Berger===
[[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] observed that while researchers supporting the secularization theory have long maintained that religion must inevitably decline in the modern world, today, much of the world is as religious as ever. This points to the falsity of the secularization theory. On the other hand, Berger also notes that secularization may be indeed have taken hold in Europe, while the United States and other regions have continued to remain religious despite the increased modernity. Dr. Berger suggested that the reason for this may have to do with the education system; in Europe, teachers are sent by the educational authorities and European parents would have to put up with secular teaching, while in the United States, schools were for much of the time under local authorities, and American parents, however unenlightened, could fire their teachers. Berger also notes that unlike Europe, America has seen the rise of Evangelical Protestantism, or "born-again Christians".&lt;ref name=dawson11&gt;Dawson, Andrew. ''Sociology of Religion''. Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Reflections on the sociology of religion today." ''Sociology of Religion 62'', no. 4 (2001): 443–454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Secularization and de-secularization." ''Religions in the modern world: Traditions and transformations 336'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bryan Wilson===
[[Bryan R. Wilson]] is a writer on secularization who is interested in the nature of life in a society dominated by scientific knowledge. His work is in the tradition of Max Weber, who saw modern societies as places in which rationality dominates life and thought. Weber saw rationality as concerned with identifying causes and working out technical efficiency, with a focus on how things work and with calculating how they can be made to work more effectively, rather than why they are as they are. According to Weber, such rational worlds are disenchanted. Existential questions about the mysteries of human existence, about who we are and why we are here, have become less and less significant.

Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"&gt;Wilson, Bryan (1982). Religion in Sociological Perspective, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insists that non-scientific systems – and religious ones in particular – have experienced an irreversible decline in influence. He has engaged in a long debate with those who dispute the secularization thesis, some of which argue that the traditional religions, such as church-centered ones, have become displaced by an abundance of non-traditional ones, such as cults and sects of various kinds. Others argue that religion has become an individual, rather than a collective, organized affair. Still others suggest that functional alternatives to traditional religion, such as nationalism and patriotism, have emerged to promote social solidarity. Wilson does accept the presence of a large variety of non-scientific forms of meaning and knowledge, but he argues that this is actually evidence of the decline of religion. The increase in the number and diversity of such systems is proof of the removal of religion from the central structural location that it occupied in pre-modern times.

===Ernest Gellner===
Unlike Wilson and Weber, [[Ernest Gellner]]&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1974). Legitimation of Belief, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (1974) acknowledges that there are drawbacks to living in a world whose main form of knowledge is confined to facts we can do nothing about and that provide us with no guidelines on how to live and how to organize ourselves. In this regard, we are worse off than pre-modern people, whose knowledge, while incorrect, at least provided them with prescriptions for living. However, Gellner insists that these disadvantages are far outweighed by the huge technological advances modern societies have experienced as a result of the application of scientific knowledge.

Gellner doesn't claim that non-scientific knowledge is in the process of dying out. For example, he accepts that religions in various forms continue to attract adherents. He also acknowledges that other forms of belief and meaning, such as those provided by art, music, literature, popular culture (a specifically modern phenomenon), drug taking, political protest, and so on are important for many people. Nevertheless, he rejects the relativist interpretation of this situation – that in modernity, scientific knowledge is just one of many accounts of existence, all of which have equal validity. This is because, for Gellner, such alternatives to science are profoundly insignificant since they are technically impotent, as opposed to science. He sees that modern preoccupations with meaning and being as a self-indulgence that is only possible because scientific knowledge has enabled our world to advance so far. Unlike those in pre-modern times, whose overriding priority is to get hold of scientific knowledge in order to begin to develop, we can afford to sit back in the luxury of our well-appointed world and ponder upon such questions because we can take for granted the kind of world science has constructed for us.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] was a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] who saw human existence as being dependent on forms of knowledge – discourses – that work like languages. Languages/discourses define reality for us. In order to think at all, we are obliged to use these definitions. The knowledge we have about the world is provided for us by the languages and discourses we encounter in the times and places in which we live our lives. Thus, who we are, what we know to be true, and what we think are discursively constructed.

Foucault defined history as the rise and fall of discourses. Social change is about changes in prevailing forms of knowledge. The job of the historian is to chart these changes and identify the reasons for them. Unlike rationalists, however, Foucault saw no element of progress in this process. To Foucault, what is distinctive about modernity is the emergence of discourses concerned with the control and regulation of the body. According to Foucault, the rise of body-centered discourses necessarily involved a process of secularization. Pre-modern discourses were dominated by religion, where things were defined as good and evil, and social life was centered around these concepts. With the emergence of modern urban societies, scientific discourses took over, and medical science was a crucial element of this new knowledge. Modern life became increasingly subject to medical control – the [[medical gaze]], as Foucault called it.

The rise to power of science, and of medicine in particular, coincided with a progressive reduction of the power of religious forms of knowledge. For example, normality and deviance became more of a matter of health and illness than of good and evil, and the physician took over from the priest the role of defining, promoting, and healing deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1977). The Birth of the Clinic: an archaeology of medical perception, London, Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other perspectives===

[[BBC News]] reported on a study by physicists and mathematicians that attempted to use mathematical modelling ([[nonlinear dynamics]]) to predict future religious orientations of populations. The study suggests that religion is headed towards "extinction" in various nations where it has been on the decline: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland. The model considers not only the changing number of people with certain beliefs, but also attempts to assign utility values of a belief in each nation.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|title='Extinction threat' to religion|first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=22 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422050308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|archivedate=22 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1012.1375|title=A mathematical model of social group competition with application to the growth of religious non-affiliation|first1=Daniel M.|last1=Abrams|first2=Haley A.|last2=Yaple|first3=Richard J.|last3=Wiener|date=16 August 2011|publisher=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=107|issue=8|accessdate=|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.088701|bibcode=2011PhRvL.107h8701A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Luckmann]] maintains that the sociology of religion should cease preoccupations with the traditional and institutionalized forms of religion. Luckmann points instead to the "religious problem" which is the "problem of individual existence." This is the case as with the advent of modernity, religious meaning making has shifted more into the individual domain.&lt;ref name=dawson11/&gt;{{rp|82}}

==Globalization==

The sociology of religion continues to grow throughout the world, attempting to understand the relationship between religion and [[globalization]]. Two older approaches to globalization include [[modernization theory]], a functionalist derivative, and [[world-systems theory]], a Marxist approach. One of the differences between these theories is whether they view [[capitalism]] as positive or problematic. However, both assumed that [[modernization]] and capitalism would diminish the hold of religion.

To the contrary, as globalization intensified many different cultures started to look into different religions and incorporate different beliefs into society.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"/&gt; New interpretations emerged that recognize the tensions. For example, according to [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion and globalization have been intertwined with each other since the early empires attempted to extend their reach across what they perceived to be world-space. Processes of globalization carried religious cosmologies – including traditional conceptions of universalism – to the corners of the world, while these cosmologies legitimated processes of globalization. This dynamic of inter-relation has continued to the present, but with changing and sometimes new and intensifying contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2010 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Mandaville | first2= Peter | title= Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions | url= https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Subpixel demonstration (Quartz).png|thumb|right|300px|Subpixel rendering works by increasing the luminance reconstruction points of a color subpixelated screen, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) or [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display. This thumbnail image is downsized and does not show the technique. Click to see the full-size image.]]
'''Subpixel rendering''' is a way to increase the apparent resolution of a computer's [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD) or [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display by rendering pixels to take into account the screen type's physical properties. It takes advantage of the fact that each [[pixel]] on a color LCD is actually composed of individual red, green, and blue or other color [[subpixel]]s to [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-alias]] text with greater detail or to increase the resolution of all image types on layouts which are specifically designed to be compatible with subpixel rendering.

==Background==
[[File:Pixel geometry 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of [[pixel geometry]], showing various arrangements of pixels and subpixels, which must be considered for subpixel rendering. LCD displays (bottom right is the most typical example) are best suited to subpixel rendering.]]
[[File:SubPixel.png|128px|thumb|left|"Aa" rendered in subpixel.]]
[[File:SubPixel.gif|128px|thumb|left|The previous image, with the {{fontcolor|red|R}}, {{fontcolor|green|G}} and {{fontcolor|blue|B}} channel separated and animated.]]

A single pixel on a color subpixelated display is made of several color primaries, typically three colored elements—ordered (on various displays) either as blue, green, and red ({{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}), or as red, green, and blue ([[RGB|{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}]]). Some displays have more than three primaries, often called MultiPrimary, such as the combination of red, green, blue, and yellow ({{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor||yellow|Y}}), or red, green, blue and white ({{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W), or even red, green, blue, yellow, and cyan ({{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor||yellow|Y}}{{fontcolor||cyan|C}}).

These pixel components, sometimes called subpixels, appear as a single color to the human eye because of blurring by the optics and spatial integration by nerve cells in the eye. The components are easily visible, however, when viewed with a small magnifying glass, such as a [[loupe]]. Over a certain resolution threshold the colors in the subpixels are not visible, but the relative intensity of the components shifts the apparent position or orientation of a line.

Subpixel rendering is better suited to some display technologies than others. The technology is well-suited to LCDs and other technologies where each logical pixel corresponds directly to three or more independent colored subpixels, but less so for [[Cathode Ray Tube|CRT]]s.

In a CRT the light from the pixel components often spreads across pixels, and the outputs of adjacent pixels are not perfectly independent. If a designer knew precisely about the display's electron beams and [[aperture grille]], subpixel rendering might have some advantage. But the properties of the CRT components, coupled with the alignment variations that are part of the production process, make subpixel rendering less effective for these displays.

The technique should have good application to [[Organic light-emitting diode|organic light emitting diodes (OLED)]] and other display technologies that organize pixels the same way as LCDs.

{{clear}}
[[File:Subpixel-rendering-RGB.png|576px|thumb|center|Pixels on an LCD are made up of separate red, green, and blue elements, which can be used to give finer control over rendering the curvature of text. The word would appear white on the screen because red, green, and blue light combined are indistinguishable from white light to the human visual system.]]

==History and patents==
The origin of subpixel rendering as used today remains controversial. Apple, then IBM, and finally Microsoft patented various implementations with certain technical differences owing to the different purposes their technologies were intended for.&lt;ref&gt;John Markoff, "[https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/12/biztech/articles/07microsoft-flat.html Microsoft's Cleartype Sets Off Debate on Originality]", ''New York Times'', December 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has several [[Software patent|patents]] in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07.&lt;ref name="cleartype_expl" /&gt; This caused [[FreeType]], the library used by most current software on the [[X Window System]], to disable this functionality by default.&lt;ref name="cleartype_expl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html|date=June 1, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2009|title=ClearType Patents, FreeType and the Unix Desktop: an explanation|author=David Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern Linux distributions turn this back on.

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/freetype/2006-09/msg00064.html|date=September 24, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2009|title=LCD Rendering Patches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple II===
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}
It is sometimes claimed (such as by [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grc.com/ctwho.htm|title=GRC - The Origins of Sub-Pixel Font Rendering|website=grc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the [[Apple II]], introduced in 1977, supports an early form of subpixel rendering in its high-resolution (280×192) graphics mode. However, the method Gibson describes can also be viewed as a limitation of the way the machine generates color, rather than as a technique intentionally exploited by programmers to increase resolution.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

David Turner&lt;!-- do not link to [[David Turner (computer scientist)]], doesn't seem to be the same person--&gt; of the [[FreeType]] project criticized Gibson's theory as to the invention, at least as far as [[patent law]] is concerned, in the following way: "For the record, the Wozniak patent is {{sic|explicitely}} referenced in the [Microsoft {{US patent|6,188,385}}], and the claims are worded precisely to avoid colliding with it (which is easy, since the Apple II only used 2 "sub-pixels", instead of the 'at minimum 3' claimed by MS)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.fonts.freetype.user/1912 David Turner (24 Sep 20:00 2006) LCD Rendering Patches] (was Re: [ft] Regression in rendering quality with subpixel antialiasing)&lt;/ref&gt; Turner further explains his view:
{{quote|Under the current US regime, any minor improvement to a previous technique can be considered an "invention" and "protected" by a patent under the right circumstances (e.g. if it's not totally trivial), {{sic|If}} we look at [Microsoft's {{US patent|6219025}}], we see that the Apple II Wozniak patent [{{US patent|4136359}}] covering this machine's display technique is listed first in the [Microsoft] patents' citations. This shows that both Microsoft and the patent examiner who granted the patents were aware of this "prior art".&lt;ref name="cleartype_expl"/&gt;}}

The [[byte]]s that comprise the Apple II high-resolution [[screen buffer]] contain seven visible bits (each corresponding directly to a pixel) and a flag bit used to select between purple/green or blue/orange color sets. Each pixel, since it is represented by a single bit, is either on or off; there are no bits within the pixel itself for specifying color or brightness. Color is instead created as an [[visual artifact|artifact]] of the [[NTSC]] color encoding scheme, determined by horizontal position: pixels with even horizontal coordinates are always purple (or blue, if the flag bit is set), and odd pixels are always green (or orange). Two lit pixels next to each other are always white, regardless of whether the pair is even/odd or odd/even, and irrespective of the value of the flag bit. The foregoing is only an approximation of the true interplay of the digital and analog behavior of the Apple's video output circuits on one hand, and the properties of real NTSC monitors on the other hand. However, this approximation is what most programmers of the time would have in mind while working with the Apple's high-resolution mode.

Gibson's example basically claims that because two bits are required to make a white block. There are in fact two bits per pixel: one which activates the purple left half of the pixel, and the other which activates the green right half of the pixel. If the programmer instead activates the green right half of a pixel and the purple half of the next pixel, then the result is a white block that is 1/2 pixel to the right, which is indeed an instance of subpixel rendering. However, it is not clear whether any programmers of the Apple II have considered the pairs of bits as pixels—instead calling each bit a pixel. While the quote from Apple II inventor [[Steve Wozniak]] on Gibson's page seems to imply that vintage Apple II graphics programmers routinely used subpixel rendering, it is difficult to make a case that many of them thought of what they were doing in such terms.

The flag bit in each byte affects color by shifting pixels half a pixel-width to the right. This half-pixel shift was exploited by some graphics software, such as HRCG (High-Resolution Character Generator), an Apple utility that displayed text using the high-resolution graphics mode, to smooth diagonals. (Many Apple II users had monochrome displays, or turned down the saturation on their color displays when running software that expected a monochrome display, so this technique was useful.) Although it did not provide a way to address subpixels individually, it did allow positioning of pixels at fractional pixel locations and can thus be considered a form of subpixel rendering. However, this technique is not related to LCD subpixel rendering as described in this article.

&lt;!--TODO: cover IBM's U.S. Patent #5341153] — Filed: 1988-06-13, "Method of and apparatus for displaying a multicolor image" --&gt;

===ClearType===
{{main|ClearType}}

[[Microsoft]] announced its subpixel rendering technology, called [[ClearType]], at [[COMDEX]] in 1998; it was then made available in [[Windows XP]], but it was not activated by default until [[Windows Vista]]. (Windows XP [[OEM]]s however could and did change the default setting.)&lt;ref name="win7"&gt;[[Greg Hitchcock]] (with introduction by [[Steven Sinofsky]]) "[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/06/23/engineering-changes-to-cleartype-in-windows-7.aspx Engineering Changes to ClearType in Windows 7]", MSDN blogs, June 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===FreeType===
[[FreeType]] is an [[open source]] implementation, but it carries the following notice: "The colour filtering algorithm of Microsoft's ClearType technology for subpixel rendering is covered by patents; for this reason the corresponding code in FreeType is disabled by default. Note that subpixel rendering per se is prior art; using a different colour filter thus easily circumvents Microsoft's patent claims."&lt;ref name="patents"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.freetype.org/patents.html |title=FreeType and Patents |date=February 13, 2018 |publisher=FreeType.org  |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SubLCD===
SubLCD is another open source subpixel rendering method that claims it does not infringe existing patents, and promises to remain unpatented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oyhus.no/SubLCD.html|title=SubLCD|website=www.oyhus.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Turner was however skeptical of SubLCD's author's claims: "Unfortunately, I, as the FreeType author, do not share his enthusiasm. The reason is precisely the very vague patent claims [by Microsoft] described previously. To me, there is a non-negligible (even if small) chance, that these claims also cover the SubLCD technique. The situation would probably be different if we could invalidate the broader patent claims, but this is not the case currently."&lt;ref name="cleartype_expl"/&gt;

===CoolType===
[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] built their own subpixel renderer called [[CoolType]], so they could display documents the same way across various operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. When it was launched around the year 2001, CoolType supported a wider range of fonts than Microsoft's ClearType, which was then limited to [[TrueType]] fonts, whereas Adobe's CoolType also supported [[PostScript fonts]] (and their [[OpenType]] equivalent as well).&lt;ref&gt;Felici, James (April 2000) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060206050218/http://www.seyboldreports.com/SRIP/free/0408/cooltype.html ClearType, CoolType: The Eyes Have It]", Seybold Report on Internet Publishing, Vol. 4 Issue 8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OS X ===
[[Mac OS X]] uses subpixel rendering as well, as part of [[Quartz 2D]]. Unlike's Microsoft's implementation, which favors a tight fit to the grid to maximize legibility, Apple's implementation prioritizes the shape of the glyphs as set out by their designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/02/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/|title=The Ails Of Typographic Anti-Aliasing|date=November 2, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PenTile ===
Starting in 1992, Candice H. Brown Elliott researched subpixel rendering and novel layouts, the [[PenTile matrix family]] pixel layout, which worked together with sub pixel [[rendering algorithm]]s to raise the resolution of color flat-panel displays.&lt;ref&gt;Brown Elliott, C.H., [http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=082320106&amp;ETOC=RN&amp; "Reducing Pixel Count without Reducing Image Quality"], Information Display Magazine, December 1999, ISSN 0362-0972&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she co-founded Clairvoyante, Inc. to commercialize these layouts and subpixel rendering algorithms. In 2008, [[Samsung]] purchased Clairvoyante and simultaneously funded a new company, Nouvoyance, Inc., retaining much of the technical staff, with Ms. Brown Elliott as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nouvoyance|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/news-031908.html|title=Press Release: Samsung Electronics Acquires Clairvoyante’s IP Assets|accessdate=August 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdQjPotT?url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/news-031908.html|archivedate=September 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addressability vs. resolution==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
With subpixel rendering technology, the number of points that may be independently addressed to reconstruct the image is increased. When the green subpixels are reconstructing the shoulders, the red subpixels are reconstructing near the peaks and vice versa. For text fonts, increasing the addressability allows the font designer to use spatial frequencies and phases that would have created noticeable distortions had it been whole pixel rendered. The improvement is most noted on italic fonts which exhibit different phases on each row. This reduction in [[Moiré pattern|moiré]] distortion is the primary benefit of subpixel rendered fonts on the conventional {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} Stripe panel.

Although subpixel rendering increases the number of reconstruction points on the display this does not always mean that higher resolution, higher spatial frequencies, more lines and spaces, may be displayed on a given arrangement of color subpixels. A phenomenon occurs as the spatial frequency is increased past the whole pixel Nyquist limit from the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]]; Chromatic aliasing (color fringes) may appear with higher spatial frequencies in a given orientation on the color subpixel arrangement.

===Example with the common {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} stripes layout===
For example, consider an {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} Stripe Panel:

This case shows the result of attempting to place vertical black and white lines at four subpixels per cycle on the {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} Stripe architecture. One can visually see that the lines, instead of being white, are colored. Starting from the left, the first line is red combined with green to produce a yellow-colored line. The second line is green combined with blue to produce a pastel cyan-colored line. The third line is blue combined with red to produce a magenta-colored line. The colors then repeat: yellow, cyan, and magenta. This demonstrates that a spatial frequency of one cycle per four subpixels is too high. Attempts to go to a yet higher spatial frequency, such as one cycle per three subpixels, would result in a single solid color.

Some LCDs compensate the inter-pixel color mix effect by having borders between pixels slightly larger than borders between subpixels. Then, in the example above, a viewer of such an LCD would see a blue line appearing adjacent to a red line instead of a single magenta line.

===Example with {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}-{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} alternated stripes layout===
Novel subpixel layouts have been developed to allow higher real resolution without chromatic aliasing. Shown here is one of the member of the PenTile matrix family of layouts. Shown below is an example of how a simple change to the arrangement of color subpixels may allow a higher limit in the horizontal direction:

[[File:Subpixel rendering RGB-GBR alternated geometry.png|73px|thumb|right|[[PenTile]] {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}-{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} alternated subpixel geometry (zoomed at 12:1).]]
 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}
 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}
 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}}

In this case, the red and green order are interchanged every row to create a red &amp; green checkerboard pattern with blue stripes. Note that the vertical subpixels could be split in half vertically to double the vertical resolution as well : the current LCD panels already typically use two color LEDs (aligned vertically and displaying the same lightness, see the zoomed images below) to illuminate each vertical subpixel. This layout is one of the PenTile matrix family of layouts. When displaying the same number of black-white lines, the blue subpixels are set at half brightness "{{fontcolor|blue|b}}":

 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_
 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_
 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_
 {{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|b}}_

Notice that every column that turns on comprises red and green subpixels at full brightness and blue subpixels at half value to balance it to white. Now, one may display black and white lines at up to one cycle per three subpixels without chromatic aliasing, twice that of the {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} Stripe architecture.

===Non-striped variants of the {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}-{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} alternated layout===
[[File:Subpixel rendering RG-B-GR alternated geometry.png|73px|thumb|right|[[PenTile]]  {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}-{{fontcolor|blue|B}}-{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} alternated subpixel geometry (zoomed at 12:1).]]
Variants of the previous layout have been proposed by Clairvoyante/Nouvoyance (and demonstrated by [[Samsung]]) as members of the PenTile matrix family of layouts specifically designed for subpixel rendering efficiency.

For example, taking advantage of the doubled visible horizontal resolution, one could double the vertical resolution to make the definition more isotropic. However this would reduce the aperture of pixels, producing lower contrasts. A better alternative uses the fact that the blue subpixels are those that contribute the least to the visible intensity, so that they are less precisely located by the eye. Blue subpixels are then rendered just as a diamond in the center of a pixel square, and the rest of the pixel surface is split in four parts as a checker board of red and green subpixels with smaller sizes. Rendering images with this variant can use the same technique as before, except that now there's a near-isotropic geometry that supports both the horizontal and the vertical with the same geometric properties, making the layout ideal for displaying the same image details when the LCD panel can be rotated.

The doubled vertical and horizontal visual resolution allows to reduce the subpixel density of about 33%, in order to increase their aperture also of about 33%, with the same separation distance between subpixels (for their electronic interconnection), and also to reduce the power dissipation of about 50% with a white/black contrast increased of about 50% and still a visual-pixel resolution enhanced by about 33% (i.e. about 125 dpi instead of 96 dpi), but with only half the total number of subpixels for the same displayed surface.

===Checkered {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}-{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W layout===
Another variant, called the {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W Quad, uses a checkerboard with 4 subpixels per pixel, adding a white subpixel, or more specifically, replacing one of the green subpixels of [[Bayer filter]] Pattern with a white subpixel, to increase the contrast and reduce the energy needed to illuminate white pixels (because color filters in classic {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} striped panels absorb more than 65% of the total white light used to illuminate the panel). As each subpixel is a square instead of a thin rectangle, this also increases the aperture with the same average subpixel density, and same pixel density along both axis. As the horizontal density is reduced and the vertical density remains identical (for the same square pixel density), it becomes possible to increase the pixel density of about 33%, while maintaining the contrast comparable to classic {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} or {{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} panels, taking profit of the more efficient use of light and lowered absorption levels by the color filters.

It is not possible to use subpixel rendering to increase the resolution without creating color fringes similar to those seen in classic {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} or {{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} striped panels, but the increased resolution compensates it, in addition, their effective visible color is reduced by the presence of "color-neutral" white subpixels.

However, this layout allows a better rendering of greys, at the price of a lower color separation. But this is consistent with human vision and with modern image and video compression formats (like [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]]) used in modern HDTV transmissions and in [[Blu-ray Disc]]s.

Yet another variant, a member for the PenTile matrix family of subpixel layouts, alternates between subpixel order {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W / {{fontcolor|blue|B}}W{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}} every other row, to allow subpixel rendering to increase the resolution, without chromatic aliasing. As before, the increased transmittance using the white subpixel allows higher subpixel density, but in this case, the displayed resolution is even higher due to the benefits of subpixel rendering:

 {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W{{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}}W

===Visual resolution versus pixel resolution and software compatibility===
Thus, not all layouts are created equal. Each particular layout may have a different "visual resolution", [[modulation transfer function|modulation transfer function limit]] (MTFL), defined as the highest number of black and white lines that may be simultaneously rendered without visible chromatic aliasing.

However, such alternate layouts are still not compatible with subpixel rendering font algorithms used in Windows, Mac OS X and [[Linux]], which currently support only the {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} or {{fontcolor|blue|B}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|red|R}} horizontal striped subpixel layouts (rotated monitors are not supported, subpixel stripes are then vertically!). However, the PenTile matrix displays have a built-in subpixel rendering engine that allows conventional {{fontcolor|red|R}}{{fontcolor|green|G}}{{fontcolor|blue|B}} data sets to be converted to the layouts, providing plug'n'play compatibility with conventional layout displays.  New display models should be proposed in the future that will allow monitor drivers to specify their visual resolution separately from the full pixel resolution and the relative position offsets of visible subpixels for each color plane, as well as their respective contribution to white intensity. Such monitor drivers would allow renderers to correctly adjust their geometry transform matrixes in order to correctly compute the values of each color plane, and take the best profit of subpixel rendering with the lowest chromatic aliasing.

==Examples==
Photos were taken with a [[Canon PowerShot A470]] digital camera using "Super Macro" mode and 4.0× digital zoom. The screen used was that integrated into a [[Lenovo]] G550 laptop. Note that the display has RGB pixels. Displays exist in all four patterns horizontal RGB/BGR and vertical RGB/BGR but horizontal RGB is the most common. In addition, several color subpixel patterns have been developed specifically to take advantage of subpixel rendering. The best known of these is the PenTile matrix family of patterns.

'''''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''''' (2001) is an [[art history]] book  by Dr. Larry Shiner (1934- ), Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, History, and Visual Arts at the [[University of Illinois, Springfield]]  &lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History: review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-226-75342-3|journal=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3633486.html|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiner spent over a decade to finish the work of this book.&lt;ref name="uis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.edu/philosophy/faculty/research/shiner.html |title=Dr. Larry Shiner - Research - Philosophy |publisher=uis.edu |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The book sees [[fine art]] as a modern invention due to [[social transformation]]s during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

David Clowney, writing for ''Contemporary Aesthetics'' summarizes the central thesis of this book.

"In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History , Larry Shiner claims that [[Art]] with a capital A, [[Fine Art]], was invented in the west in the eighteenth century. The claim is not original with him; he credits [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]]’s essay “The Modern System of the Arts” as the inspiration for his work. Others have made this claim as well, among them [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Paul Mattick]], and [[Terry Eagleton]]. What Shiner has added is a detailed proof of the Kristeller claim using the methods of intellectual, social, cultural, and art history.

In brief, the thesis is this: There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art,” in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “[[skill]]”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war,” “the art of love,” and “the art of medicine.”"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=David Clowney|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into five parts
* ''I.   Before Fine Art and Craft'' - Details the lack of any differentiation between skilled work of any type during three periods of history; classical antiquity, the middle ages, and [[the Renaissance]]. The lack of any social role separating artists from artisans, nor any concept of the aesthetic is also discussed. In the final chapter of Part I, the beginnings of some differentiation during the 17th century is described.
* ''II.  Art Divided''
* ''III. Countercurrents'' 
* ''IV.  The Apotheosis of Art'' 
* ''V.   Beyond Art and Craft''.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

==Quotes==
“The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.” (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

== Reviews ==
In a book review published in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Mitch Avila   wrote:&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Avila|first1=Mitch|title=Reviews: The Invention of Art: A Cultural History by Larry Shiner|journal= The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume= 61|issue=4|pages=401–403|date=Autumn 2003|jstor= 1559075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shiner aptly characterizes his narrative as one that aims to heal the unnecessarily fractured conceptions of art and art practice that mark the contemporary artworld... By showing that the essentialist conception of art, along with its normative and regulative implications, is the artifact of a particular historical and cultural world, Shiner invites us to freely respond to the manifold richness of human expression and embellishment.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewer Marc Spiegler called the book "a must-read for anyone active in the arts".&lt;ref name=Spiegler&gt;

'''The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship''' was founded by the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] painter [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] on September 2004, as the first, and currently the only, Greek group of [[Stuckism|Stuckism International]]. It has an international membership.

==History==
[[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems "the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is taken up in Yakoumis' article, "The Academic Provincialism of contemporary Greek Art and its proposed Stuckist remedy", to be presented by him at the first Stuckist international symposium [http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html ''The Triumph of Stuckism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414172054/http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html |date=2006-04-14 }} in Liverpool, England&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a "Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's [[Parochialism|provincialism]], [[sectarianism]] and servile importation of [[post-modernism]]". He developed the concept of "Romantic Stuckism", that is of "Stuckism with a good injection of [[Eleatic]] and [[Platonic philosophy]], oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.

At that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as "ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility."  He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was [http://www.ianjburkett.co.uk/ Ian J. Burkett], a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher [http://www.ilaniaabileah.com/ Ilania Abileah] from Canada, and the painter and etcher [http://www.artworksbyanthe.com/ Anthe] (who is of Greek descent) from the US.

==Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity==
Yakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought "in the flesh" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled ''Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity'', announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.

In parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled "Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)" (Ash-In-Art Publications).

Stuckist artists taking part include:

'''Ticio Escobar''' is a [[Paraguay]]an lawyer, academic, author, museum director, and former Minister of Culture of Paraguay.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He has championed the rights of [[Indigenous peoples of Paraguay]], writing about and curating shows on the topic.

== Early life and education ==
Escobar was born on February 9, 1947, in [[Asunción]]. His father was jurist Jorge H. Escobar, and his mother is María Rosalba Argaña Ferraro.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; He graduated in Law at the [[Universidad Católica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] in 1970. Five years later, in 1974, he obtained his [[Master's degree]] (''licencia'') here in [[Philosophy]]. During his study, he was a member of the Comisión de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos en el Paraguay, a [[human rights]] group.&lt;ref name="docPCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/TICIO.doc biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.nl/urbanheroes/escobar/eng/index.htm ''Urban Heroes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Between 1971 and 1989, Escobar was a university professor in the fields of [[philosophy of law]], [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical anthropology]], [[history of art]] and [[art criticism]].&lt;ref name="AQE"&gt;A Quienes Elegimos, [http://www.aquieneselegimos.org.py/dat/679-cv1-1(ul).doc Curriculum Vitae] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1980, he was an art reviewer for the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo. In 1979 he founded the [[Museo del Barro]] (museum of pottery) in Asunción, with the objective to preserve Paraguayan culture. The same year he also founded the Museo de Arte Indígena, Centro de Artes Visuales (museum for indigenous art, center of visual art). To this museum, of which he was also the director until 2008, he donated his own art collection.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AQE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/344 profile]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and activism==
Between 1978 and 1988, Escobar was the curator for Paraguay at the Biennale of [[São Paulo]]. Furthermore, he was curator for several versions of the [[Venice Biennale]] and the biennales of [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lima]] and [[Porto Alegre]], and for a number of expositions in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]]. At the beginning of the 1990s, he joined two movements for [[Indigenous peoples' rights]]: the Asociación Indigenista del Paraguay and the Asociación Apoyo a las Comunidades Indígenas del Paraguay (ACIP).&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;

From 1991-1996 he was Director of Culture of the city of Asunción.&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt; In 1996 he won a national contest to edit a bill on culture, which was later adopted by parliament as ''Ley Escobar 3051/06''. From 2008-2013 he was the Minister of Culture of the government of [[Fernando Lugo]].&lt;ref name=guarani/&gt;&lt;ref name="docPCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UH-PCF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBA"&gt;Circulo de Bellas Artes, [http://www.circulobellasartes.com/ficha.php?s=fich_bio&amp;id=653 biography] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Habana Radio (11 February 2011) [http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 ''Ticio Escobar, el crítico devenido Ministro''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412053822/http://www.habanaradio.cu/singlefile_news/?id_not=20110211163053 |date=2013-04-12 }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time Structured Mapping''' (TSM) is a [[musical notation|score based]] system created and used by the composer [[Pete M Wyer|Pete M. Wyer]]. It uses the [[bar (music)|bar-lines]] found in conventional musical scores to indicate durational periods during which performers, who may include actors, singers, dancers, poets as well as musicians, are given instructions, which may include conventional musical scoring or [[improvisation]]al guidelines (see: [[musical improvisation]]).
The system allows large and sometimes disparate groups to improvise together coherently, or to combine improvisation with scored music or with other media. It has been used to get orchestras, including the [[Orchestra of the Swan]] (see below), to improvise effectively and in educational projects, to combine student musicians with professionals, such as with [[Welsh National Opera]] and to combine other media such as dance and poetry with musical improvisation in a structured form, such as with [http://www.mirodancetheatre.org/ Miro Dance Theatre], Philadelphia.

The flexibility of the system has allowed for the combination of musicians from very different backgrounds, as well as disparate ensembles with players of very different standards. Works generally combine improvisation with conventional scoring and move frequently from one system to the other. The synchronisation using 'clock-time' as a basis has also enabled works made up of players who are spatially separated such as with ''Four Bridges'' which was performed simultaneously in Britain, Germany, America and India, it allows for  works which alter the conventional relationship of the composer with the musician by involving the performer directly into the creative process.

In 2004 Wyer began creating [[Simultaneity]] works: works that made recordings at the same time in different locations. The first recordings took place around [[Columbus Circle]], New York – Wyer mapped out a circumference that passed through the Time Warner building and around the periphery of Columbus Circle itself and, with the help of a team of volunteer staff from [[WNYC]] radio, made a series of simultaneous recordings that, when played back across multiple speakers, gave what he described as a ‘God’s ear view’ of the location – the experience of being at all points simultaneously; cars, subway trains and people moved from speaker to speaker, featuring the endless rotation of revolving doors that interfaced the very contrasting sonic landscape of the interior of the [[Time Warner Building]] with the bustling Manhattan streets outside.

This led to Simultaneity recordings that were not made in the same location: in December 2004, with volunteers primarily from [[Canadian Electroacoustic Community|CEC]] Canada’s online forum, a recording was made simultaneously in countries around the world:  volunteers were asked to record exactly the same twenty minutes of their environment wherever they were in the world, regardless of time-zone, but to include something that marked the hour changing. Volunteers recorded  dawn choruses (Australia), tolling bells (Australia), railway station announcements (New Zealand), clocks in a clock shop (San Francisco), ambient sound in Police Square (Manhattan), evening traffic (Berlin),  the backstage at English National Opera (London) late night rains (Tunis)  late night chatter (Mumbai), the sounds of the jungle (Laos),  dogs barking (northern Alaska). Resulting in a complex array of sounds that coalesced into a moment of intensity as the hour struck and then dissipated back to the disparate ambient environments.

== Time structured mapping ==
In his search to incorporate the philosophy of Simultaneity within western musical systems, Wyer returned to a frequent inspiration; birdsong;  struck by the endless combinations and re-combinations of the songs of the dawn chorus he began considering ways to create systems that would enable simultaneous solos that combined in musically intelligent, coherent ways - that necessarily moved away from the western convention of counting a beat for each bar.

In 2005 Wyer made his first Time Structured Maps using the same basic scores as might be used for an orchestra but where each bar-line represented a period of 30 seconds rather than a count and each ‘bar’ consisted of a set of instructions for how to improvise during that time period, which might be very specific or left ambiguous. The result was a system that enabled musicians from all backgrounds to play together, and to incorporate other forms such as dance, speech etc. within a score.

The first significant work for the system was for the Orchestra of the Swan with a Time Structured Map (TSM) based work called Traveller, ''There Are No Paths, Paths Are Made By Walking'' created in the summer of 2005.
A second, much more ambitious work, Four Bridges, was performed in November 2005, it combined the ideas of Simultaneity with the Time Structured Mapping system: the Orchestra of the Swan played from the score in England while pianist Burkhard Finke in Frankfurt, microtonal vocal specialist [[Toby Twining]] in Boston and Indian Classical singer Anand Thakore in Mumbai performed simultaneously from the same score, without hearing each other – each performance was recorded and later combined into a work for 8 speakers, which was later broadcasrt on [[WNYC|WNYC New Sounds]].

In 2009, Time Structured Mapping was used for the creation of the one-hour ''Insomnia Poems'' for BBC Radio 3 ([[BBC Radio 3|Jazz On 3]]) &lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 3 Jazz On 3.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined post-beat poet [[Steve Dalachinsky]] with a five-piece band consisting of soprano, Evelyne Beech, electronics and processing, Mike Cross, clarinets and saxes, [[Christopher Cundy|Chris Cundy]], bass, Robert Perry and Pete M Wyer on guitar, piano with found sounds and manipulations – each performing with a synchronized stopwatch. The piece was popularly received, retaining the energy and spontaneity of improvisation within the dynamic and tonal structure of a conventionally scored piece.

Further development, funded by the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council Of England]], enabled workshops which in turn led to new works using the system: Welsh National Opera &lt;ref&gt;Welsh National Opera.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used it for a series of educational works alongside their 2010 UK tour, the [http://www.orchestraoftheswan.org Orchestra of the Swan] also using TSM scores for ''Four Sonnets'', a twenty-minute work created in July 2010 which combined improvisation within the orchestra with text fragments submitted according to the score from members of the public and ''Listening To The Sky', ''a one hour work for chamber group with sound design, which used a TSM score to combine orchestra performance with sounds created according to the Time Structured Map''.

'''Tricarbon''' (systematically named '''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,3λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-propadiene''' and '''''catena''-tricarbon''') is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{Chem|C|2|(μ-C)}} (also written [C(μ-C)C] or {{Chem|C|3}}). It is a colourless gas that only persists in dilution or solution as an [[adduct]]. It is one of the simplest [[saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[carbene]]s.

It is a small [[carbon]] cluster first [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] observed in the beginning 20th century in the tail of a comet by [[William Huggins]] and subsequently identified in [[stellar atmosphere]]s. Tricarbon can be found in interstellar space and can be produced in the laboratory by a process called [[laser ablation]]. Small carbon clusters like tricarbon and [[dicarbon]] are regarded as soot precursors and are implicated in the formation of certain industrial [[diamond]]s and in the formation of [[fullerene]]s. The ground state [[molecular geometry]] of tricarbon has been identified as linear via its characteristic symmetric and antisymmetric stretching and bending vibrational modes and bears [[bond length]]s of 129 to 130 [[picometer]] corresponding to those of [[alkene]]s. The [[ionization potential]] is determined experimentally at 11 to 13.5 [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref name="Nicolas"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nicolas | first = Christophe | display-authors=etal  | date = 2006 | title = Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoionization of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|J.

C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has also been identified as a transient species in various [[combustion]] reactions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The generation of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated by Professor Emeritus [[Philip Skell|Philip S. Skell]] of [[Pennsylvania State University]] in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Nomenclature ==

The systematic names ''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,3λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-propadiene'', and ''μ-carbidodicarbon'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively.

In appropriate contexts, tricarbon can be viewed as [[propadiene]] with four hydrogen atoms removed, or as propane with eight electrons removed; and as such, ''propadienediylidene'' or ''propanetetraylidene'', respectively, may be used as a context-specific systematic names, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the tricarbon molecule. In even more specific context, these can also name the non-radical singlet state, whereas the diradical state is named ''propadienediylylidene'', or ''propanediyldiylidene'', and the tetraradical state is named ''propedienetetrayl'' or ''propanetetraylylidene''.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">'''Useful art''', or '''useful arts''' or '''technics''', is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship. The phrase has now gone out of fashion, but it was used during the [[Victorian era]] and earlier as an antonym to the [[performing art]] and the [[fine art]].&lt;ref&gt; George Washington used the term in a letter to Lafayette (Jan. 29, 1798). Washington distinguished commerce from useful arts by stating, “While our commerce has been considerably curtailed for want of that extensive credit formerly given in Europe, and for default of remittance; the useful arts have been almost imperceptibly pushed to a considerable degree of perfection.”  THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON FROM THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT SOURCES, 1732-1799 (Fitzpatrick ed.).  Other literary sources are collected in the PTO Supp. Br., ''In re Bilski'', p. 11 n.4 (useful arts are manufacturing processes).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "useful Arts" is used in the [[United States Constitution]], [[Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_8:_Powers_of_Congress|Article One, Section 8, Clause 8]] which is the basis of United States [[patents in the United States|patent]] and [[Copyright in the United States|copyright]] law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;…"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the clause, the phrase "useful Arts" is meant to reference inventions, while "Science" is meant to reference human knowledge, including{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} that which is encompassed in literature and the "fine arts".

In his dissenting opinion in ''[[In re Bilski]]'',&lt;ref&gt;In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haldane Robert Mayer|Judge Mayer]] criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts. In Mayer's view this should have been dispositive, because he considered the claimed [[business method]] not to be within the useful arts. In the same case, [[Timothy Dyk|Judge Dyk]] filed a concurring opinion to similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://works.bepress.com/malla_pollack/12  Malla Pollack], "The Multiple Unconstitutionality of Business Method Patents: Common Sense, Congressional Choice, and Constitutional History" 61 Rutgers Computer &amp; Tech.
