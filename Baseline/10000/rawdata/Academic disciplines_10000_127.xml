Nitrogen, acting as an oxidant, is therefore reduced in a succession of four reactions performed by the enzymes [[Nitrate reductase|nitrate]], [[Nitrite reductase|nitrite]], [[Nitric-oxide reductase|nitric-oxide]], and [[Nitrous-oxide reductase|nitrous oxide]] reductases.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  The pathway ultimately yields reduced molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as, when the reaction does not reach completion, the intermediate species [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  A simple [[denitrification]] reaction proceeds as:

:{{chem|NO|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO →  {{chem|N|2|O}} → {{chem|N|2}} (g)

The [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reaction which utilizes oxygen as the oxidant is:

:{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} (aq) + 6{{chem|O|2}} (g) → 6{{chem|CO|2}} (g) + 6{{chem|H|2|O|}}

Classically, it was thought that denitrification would not occur in the presence of oxygen since there seems to be no energetic advantage to using nitrate as an oxidant when oxygen is available.&lt;ref name=soils/&gt;  Experiments have since proven that denitrifiers are often [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative anaerobes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=William H.|year=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-625155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aerobic denitrification does indeed occur in a broad range of [[Denitrifying bacteria|microbial organisms]] with varying levels of productivity, usually lower productivity than results from purely aerobic respiration.  The advantages of being able to perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen are uncertain, though it is possible that the ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels plays a role.&lt;ref name=controversy/&gt; Aerobic denitrification may be found in environments where fluctuating oxygen concentrations and reduced carbon are available&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relative harsh environment inspires the potential of denitrifiers to degrade toxic nitrate or nitrate under an aerobic atmosphere. Aerobic denitrifiers tend to work efficiently at 25 ~ 37°C and pH 7 ~ 8, when dissolved oxygen concentration is 3 ~ 5 mg/L and C/N load ratio is 5 ~ 10&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

==Environmental impact==

=== Wastewater treatment ===
Water treatment often relies on the activity of [[Denitrification|anaerobically denitrifying bacteria]] in order to remove [[nitrate]] from water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lv|first=Pengyi|last2=Luo|first2=Jinxue|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xuliang|last4=Zhang|first4=Dongqing|last5=Huang|first5=Zhanbin|last6=Bai|first6=Zhihui|date=2017-08-30|title=Diversity of culturable aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the sediment, water and biofilms in Liangshui River of Beijing, China|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09556-9|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09556-9|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of oxygen, nitrate cannot be fully reduced to [[dinitrogen]], thus nitrate remains in the water or it is converted to nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lingering nitrate in drinking water poses a plethora of health risks, and both nitrate and nitrous oxide have major environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Alyce M.|last2=Diaz|first2=James H.|last3=Kaye|first3=Alan David|date=2014|title=Reexamining the Risks of Drinking-Water Nitrates on Public Health|journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=392–398|issn=1524-5012|pmc=4171798|pmid=25249806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Emma L.|last2=Allison|first2=Steven D.|date=2012-07-31|title=Meta-Analysis of Environmental Impacts on Nitrous Oxide Release in Response to N Amendment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00272|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3408851|pmid=22866053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hazards include, [[carcinogen]]ic nitrate ions in drinking water, or [[eutrophication]] caused by oxidized nitrogen seeding [[Algal bloom]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=David|date=1993-10-01|title=Aerobic denitrification in soils and sediments: From fallacies to factx|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016953479390218E|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=8|issue=10|pages=352–356|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90218-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely aerobic denitrification can further reduce oxidized nitrogen in a less specialized environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, many aerobically denitrifying bacteria from the [[pseudomonas]] genus (''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri|Pm. stutzeri]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas mendocina|Pm. mendocina]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas putida|Pm. Putida]])'' were shown to be isolated from the [[Lingshui River|Liangshui river]] in China, and could be further used in [[bioaugmentation]] to clear contaminated water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Pseudomas,  ''[[Acinetobacter]] sp.'' SYF26 was isolated from the [[Heihe|Hei He]] reservoir in [[China]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su|first=Jun-feng|last2=Zhang|first2=Kai|last3=Huang|first3=Ting-lin|last4=Wen|first4=Gang|last5=Guo|first5=Lin|last6=Yang|first6=Shao-fei|date=2015|title=Heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification at low nutrient conditions by a newly isolated bacterium, Acinetobacter sp.

==== Global warming ====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is a 200-300 times more potent [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]], accounting for 5% of the global green house gas effect.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takaya|first=Naoki|last2=Catalan-Sakairi|first2=Maria|last3=Sakaguchi|first3=Yasushi|last4=Kato|first4=Isao|last5=Zhou|first5=Zhemin|last6=Shoun|first6=Hirofumi|date=June 2003|title=Aerobic Denitrification Bacteria That Produce Low Levels of Nitrous Oxide|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/69/6/3152.full.pdf|journal=American Society for Microbiology|volume=|pages=3152–3157|via=http://aem.asm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reduction of nitrate in [[wastewater treatment]], nitrous oxide is only released in the absence of appropriate [[oxygen]] regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some solutions to combat the release of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment could be to use aerobically denitrifying organisms with the capacity to fully reduce nitrogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, ''[[Pseudomonas denitrificans|P. Denitrificans]]'' has shown to efficiently reduce nitrate to [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in cultured media and wastewater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, TR2 strains of [[Pseudomonas stutzeri|P. sturzeri]] and [[Pseudomonas]] sp. strain K50 were also shown to have substantially low levels of nitrous oxide production in [[water treatment]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus enriching [[activated sludge]] for aerobic denitrifying bacteria can be effective in combating the global warming effects of nitrous oxide in [[wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''African Gender Institute''' (AGI) is a [[feminist]] research and teaching group that studies [[gender studies|issues related to gender]] in Africa. It has become a department at the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), administered within the School of African and Gender Studies, Social Anthropology and Linguistics. The AGI has its own dedicated staff and has a unique degree of independence from UCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02610151211235505 |title=Reflections on being a feminist academic/academic feminism in South Africa |year=2012 |last1=Gouws |first1=Amanda |journal=Equality, Diversity and Inclusion |volume=31 |issue=5/6 |pages=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The AGI describes itself as specifically feminist and seeks to promote [[feminism]] on the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agi.ac.za/mission-and-vision |title=Mission and Vision |publisher=African Gender Institute |quote=Powerfully feminist in philosophy and practice the AGI offers programmes of teaching and research on gender in the contexts of, inter alia, sexuality, development, land reform, law, conflict, politics, race, economics and culture. |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AGI serves as a point of contact for feminist intellectuals across Africa, many of whom suffer from isolation and discrimination at their academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sylvia Tamale]], profiled in: Gretchen L. Wilson, "African Female Scholars Share Virtual Lifeline", ''Women's eNews'' on ''WorldPress'', 21 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amina Mama]]—a key figure at the AGI—has argued that the organization constitutes a key exception to [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] commodification of and control over African academics.&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW interview"&gt;Amina Mama interviewed by Elaine Salo, "Talking about Feminism in Africa", reproduced in ''Women's World'' from ''Agenda'', "African Feminisms I", no. 50 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; A major goal of the AGI is to maintain an institutional space for African feminists to network, collaborate, teach, and research.&lt;ref name="Mama 2011"/&gt;

==History==
The AGI grew out of the Equal Opportunities Research Project, created at the University of Cape Town in 1992 as [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] was ending. The AGI was created in 1996, with the specific goal of advocating for women researchers, policy advocates and writers based within African countries, and with commitment to the growth and voice of African feminisms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agi.ac.za/about/history |title=History |publisher=African Gender Institute |quote=Powerfully feminist in philosophy and practice the AGI offers programmes of teaching and research on gender in the contexts of, inter alia, sexuality, development, land reform, law, conflict, politics, race, economics and culture. |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mama became director of the AGI in 2000 and helped to found its journal ''[[Feminist Africa]]''.&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=200759 |title=One-way ticket just isn't an option |author=Karen MacGregor |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |accessdate=2012-12-16 |date=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mama's leadership, projects in women's access to e-technologies, women's peace activism, sexual and reproductive rights, and projects on citizenship were undertaken, with contributors across the continent. Key amoing these were Elaine Salo, Sisonke Msimang, Jane Bennett, [[Jennifer Radloff]], and Yaliwe Clarke in South Africa, [[Charmaine Pereira]] in Nigeria, Sylvia Tamale and Ruth Ochieng in Uganda, Takyiwaa Manuh and Akosua Ampofo in Ghana, and many others. The AGI also grew a strong undergraduate and graduate teaching and research programme within the university of Cape Town.

Faced with budget cuts andshifting institutional support, the AGI found itself split from the project of Gender Studies at UCT. The AGI, under the directorship of Jane Bennett from 2008 to 2017, focused on consolidating its core intellectual positions and its institutional position at UCT, and continued to run successful projects, especially in sexuality and reproductive justice work. These efforts were generally successful, and in 2017, Yaliwe Clarke took over the directorship of the AGI with new agendas for strengthening black, queer and African work especially among young women. This was strongly supported by a new Advisory Board &lt;ref name="intellectuals"&gt;Amina Mama, "Gender studies for Africa's transformation", in ''African Intellectuals: Rethinking Politics, Language, Gender and Development'', ed. Thandika Mkandawire, London: Zed Books and [[Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|CODESRIA]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[File:Uct open day 035.jpg|thumb|300px|High school students check out the African Gender Institute during a UCT open day]]
Gender and Women's Studies for Africa's Transformation, or GWS Africa, is one of AGI's major projects. GWS Africa is an effort aimed at creating and sharing a strong intellectual core for feminists across Africa. Much of GWS Africa takes place online, through a listserv and a website. The organization generated ''Feminist Africa'', which mostly circulates online.&lt;ref name="intellectuals"/&gt; Through GWS Africa, the AGI has been a major force for increasing women's access to internet communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hafkin, Nancy J. |chapter=Convergence of Concepts: Gender and ICTs in Africa |editor1=Adera, Edith Ofwona |editor2=Rathgeber, Eva-Maria |title=Gender and the information revolution in Africa |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-88936-903-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000–2002, GWS Africa conducted a survey of Gender and/or Women's Studies Departments across Africa. It found that these disciplines were generally on the rise, but that many of them had adopted the mainstream [[Women in Development]] (WID) approach. This finding reinforced the AGI's desire to foster a more critical African feminist discourse, and led in 2002 to a significant pan-African feminist forum in 2002, held at UCT.&lt;ref name="Mama 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/fr/conf-proceedings/n1s/full/fr201122a.html |title=What does it mean to do feminist research in African contexts |author=Amina Mama |journal=Feminist Theory &amp; Activism in Global Perspective: Feminist Review Conference Proceedings |pages=e4–e20 |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002 on, the AGI's work on strengthening gender studies and feminist work on the continent grew in multiple directions, including the creation of a Southern Africa-wide network on sexual harassment in higher education, the growth of feminist-oriented e-space specifically designed for the interest of African-based feminists, the regular publication of ''Feminist Africa'', and many capacity-building workshops on questions of land, movement building, militarism and sexuality.

From 2008 on, under the new directorship of Jane Bennett, programmes on sexuality and reproductive justice were strengthened while other AGI threads were simultaneously developed by a very strong team, including Yaliwe Clarke working on women's peace activism with Ruth Ochieng of ISIS-Wicce in Uganda.The teaching programmes within the University of Cape Town grew strongly, and partnerships were built with [[Barnard College]] in New York, the Gino Germani Institute in Buenos Aires, and [[CODESRIA]] in Senegal. E-advocacy projects were built by Selina Mudavanhu, and others.

In 2012, the University of Cape Town instituted a merger process which split the AGI's public project work from its gender studies teaching, creating a new section of Gender Studies. This had challenging impacts, but the AGI continued to stabilize itself with new programmes in young women's leadership in sexuality. 

In 2017, under new directorship again, with Yaliwe Clarke, the AGI ran programmes in queer visuality, with film festivals in different locations, and initiated work on a symposium entitled "Dreaming the Future," to celebrate the work of acclaimed South Arican feminist, Pumla Gqola.

They were one of the first [[Bronze age]] people in the world. Early on they used [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[gold]], and later they used [[iron]]. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for [[armor]] as well as for different weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s.

According to the assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]], the earliest [[pump]] was the [[Archimedes' screw]], first used by [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], for the [[Domestic water system|water systems]] at the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and [[Nineveh]] in the 7th century BCE. This attribution, however, is refuted by the historian of ancient water-lifting devices Olseon in the same paper, who still credits, as well as most other scholars, [[Archimedes]] with the invention.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003).

Perhaps the most important advance made by the [[Mesopotamia]]ns was the [[Cuneiform|invention of writing]] by the [[Sumer]]ians. With the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called the [[Code of Hammurabi]] as well as the first major piece of literature called the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

Although archaeologists don't know for sure who invented the wheel, the oldest wheel discovered was found in Mesopotamia. It is likely the Sumer first used the wheel in making pottery in 3500BC and used it for their chariots in around 3200 BC.

The Mesopotamians used a [[sexagesimal]] number system with the base 60 (like we use base 10). They divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60-minute hour, which we still use today. They also divided up the circle into 360 degrees. They had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic and cubic equations, and fractions. This was important in keeping track of records as well as in some of their large building projects. The Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles. Some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean Theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down. They may have even discovered the number for pi in figuring the circumference of a circle.

[[Babylonian astronomy]] was able to follow the movements of the stars, planets, and the Moon. Application of advanced math predicted the movements of several planets.  By studying the phases of the Moon, the Mesopotamians created the first [[calendar]]. It had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the [[Jewish calendar|Jewish]] and [[Greek calendar]]s.

[[Babylonian medicine]] used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams and pills. Mesopotamians had two kinds of medical practices, magical and physical. Unlike today they would use both on the same patient. They didn’t see it as one as good and one as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Chadwick, ''First Civilization: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt (2)'' (London: Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2005), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesopotamians made many technological discoveries. They were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better pottery, they used irrigation to get water to their crops, they used bronze metal (and later iron metal) to make strong tools and weapons, and used looms to weave cloth from wool.

For later medieval technologies developed in the Mesopotamian region, now known as [[Iraq]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

===Egypt===
[[File:TurinPapyrus1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Left half of the Turin papyrus map, courtesy J. Harrell]]
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. They were among the first to extract [[gold]] by large-scale mining using [[fire-setting]], and the first recognisable [[map]], the [[Turin papyrus]] shows the plan of one such mine in [[Nubia]].

Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The [[wheel]], however, did not arrive until foreign invaders introduced the [[chariot]]. They developed Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including ships and lighthouses. Early construction techniques utilized by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals. These constructs would have been vital in flood control and irrigation, especially along the Nile delta.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Trzciñski , Malgorzata Zaremba , Sawomir Rzepka , Fabian Welc , and Tomasz Szczepañski. “Preliminary Report on Engineering Properties and Environmental Resistance of Ancient Mud Bricks from Tell El-retaba Archaeological Site in the Nile Delta,” ''Studia Quarternaria'' 33, no. 1 (2016): 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
{{main|Science and technology in Africa}}
Technology in Africa has a history stretching to the beginning of the human species, stretching back to the first evidence of [[Stone Age|tool use]] by hominid ancestors in the [[Hominid evolution|areas of Africa]] where humans are believed to have evolved. Africa saw the advent of some of the earliest [[ironworking]] technology in the [[Aïr Mountains]] region of what is today [[Niger]] and the erection of some of the world's oldest monuments, pyramids and towers in [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and [[History of North Africa|North Africa]]. In Nubia and ancient Kush, glazed quartzite and building in brick was developed to a greater extent than in Egypt. Parts of the East African [[Swahili Coast]] saw the creation of the world's oldest [[carbon steel]] creation with high-temperature [[blast furnace]]s created by the [[Haya people]] of Tanzania.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
{{main|History of Indian Science and Technology|List of Indian inventions}}
{{See also|List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization}}

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to the earliest civilizations of the world. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[mathematics]], [[hydrography]], [[metrology]], and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Cities in the Indus Valley offer some of the first examples of closed gutters, public baths, and communal granaries. The [[Takshashila]] University was an important seat of learning in the ancient world. It was the center of education for scholars from all over Asia. Many [[Greeks|Greek]], Persian and [[China|Chinese]] students studied here under great scholars including [[Kautilya]], Panini, [[Jivaka]], and Vishnu Sharma.
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|200px|Excavated ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]], Pakistan.]]

The ancient system of medicine in India, [[Ayurveda]] was a significant milestone in Indian history. It mainly uses herbs as medicines. Its origins can be traced back to origin of [[Atharvaveda]]. The [[Sushruta Samhita]] (400 BC) by Sushruta has details about performing cataract surgery, plastic surgery, etc.

Ancient India was also at the forefront of seafaring technology - a panel found at [[Mohenjo-daro]], depicts a sailing craft. Ship construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on Shipbuilding. (The Yukti Kalpa Taru had been translated and published by Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit [[Manuscripts]]').

Indian construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding or materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation. Ancient Indian culture was also pioneering in its use of vegetable dyes, cultivating plants including [[indigo]] and [[cinnabar]]. Many of the dyes were used in art and sculpture. The use of [[perfume]]s demonstrates some knowledge of [[chemistry]], particularly [[distillation]] and purification processes.

=== China ===
{{main|History of science and technology in China|List of Chinese inventions}}
[[File:ArmillarySphere1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chinese [[armillary sphere]]]]

The [[history of science and technology in China]] shows significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced. The [[Four Great Inventions]] of China: the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], papermaking, and printing were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages.

According to the Scottish researcher [[Joseph Needham]], the Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismology|seismological]] detectors, [[matches]], [[paper]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the iron [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[suspension bridge]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[magnetic compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], the [[south-pointing chariot]], and [[gunpowder]]. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: [[block printing]] and [[movable type]], phosphorescent paint, and the [[spinning wheel]].

The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150 AD, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[black powder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). At the same time that the [[age of exploration]] was occurring in the West, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent ships, [[Treasure voyages|some reaching Africa]]. But the enterprises were not further funded, halting further exploration and development. When [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ships reached [[Brunei]] in 1521, they found a wealthy city that had been fortified by Chinese engineers, and protected by a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that much of the technology of Brunei was equal to Western technology of the time. Also, there were more cannons in Brunei than on Magellan's ships, and the Chinese merchants to the Brunei court had sold them [[spectacles]] and [[porcelain]], which were rarities in Europe.

===Persia===
{{main|Science and technology in Iran}}

The [[Qanat]], a water management system used for irrigation, originated in [[Iran]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] of Persia&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt;. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]] which, after 2,700&amp;nbsp;years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward English  | first = Paul  | title = The Origin and Spread of Qanats in the Old World | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume =  112| issue =  3 | pages =170–181 | publisher = [[JSTOR]]

In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, Persians in [[Afghanistan]] developed the first practical [[windmill]]s. For later medieval technologies developed in [[Islamization of Iran|Islamic Persia]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

=== Greek and Hellenistic ===
[[File:Heron's Windwheel.jpg|thumb|200px|Hero's wind-powered [[Organ (music)|organ]] (reconstruction)]]
{{main|Ancient Greek technology}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Some inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks are the following: the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, [[water clock]], [[water organ]](hydraulis), [[torsion siege engine]], and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers invented many technologies and improved upon pre-existing technologies, particularly during the [[Hellenistic period]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] invented a basic [[steam engine]] and demonstrated knowledge of mechanic and pneumatic systems. [[Archimedes]] invented several machines. The Greeks were unique in pre-industrial times in their ability to combine scientific research with the development of new technologies. One example is the [[Archimedean screw]]; this technology was first conceptualized in mathematics, then built. Other technologies invented by Greek scientists include the [[ballista]]e, the [[piston pump]], and primitive [[analog computers]] like the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. Greek architects were responsible for the first true [[dome]]s, and were the first to explore the [[Golden ratio]] and its relationship with geometry and architecture.

Apart from [[Hero of Alexandria]]'s steam [[aeolipile]], Hellenistic technicians were the first to invent watermills and windwheels, making them global pioneers in three of the four known means of non-human propulsion prior to the Industrial Revolution (the fourth being sails). However, only water power was used extensively in antiquity.

Other Greek inventions include torsion catapults, pneumatic catapults, crossbows, cranes, rutways, organs, the keyboard mechanism, gears, differential gears, screws, refined parchment, showers, dry docks, diving bells, odometer and astrolabes. In architecture, Greek engineers constructed monumental lighthouses such as the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] and devised the first central heating systems. The [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] is the earliest tunnel in history which has been excavated with a scientific approach from both ends.

Automata like vending machines, automatic doors and many other ingenious devices were first built by Hellenistic engineers as [[Ctesibius]], [[Philo of Byzantium]] and Heron. Greek technological treatises were scrupuously studied and copied by later Byzantine, Arabic and Latin European scholars and provided much of the foundation for further technological advances in these civilizations.

=== Roman ===
{{main|Roman technology}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]

[[Roman technology]] supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had an advanced set of technology for their time. Some of the Roman technology in Europe may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats in many different areas like: civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the [[mechanical reaper]] went unmatched until the 19th century.
Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stonemasonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. They also developed water power through building aqueducts on a grand scale, using water not just for drinking supplies but also for [[irrigation]], powering [[water mill]]s and in mining. They used drainage wheels extensively in deep underground mines, one device being the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. They were the first to apply [[hydraulic mining]] methods for prospecting for metal ores, and for extracting those ores from the ground when found using a method known as [[hushing]].

Roman engineers build [[monumental arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[List of Roman dams|dam]]s, vaults and [[List of Roman domes|domes]] on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day. Roman society had also carried over the design of a door lock with tumblers and springs from Greece. Like many other aspects of innovation and culture that were carried on from Greece to Rome, the lines between where each one originated from have become skewed over time. These mechanisms were highly sophisticated and intricate for the era.&lt;ref&gt;Naif A. Haddad, "Critical Review, Assessment and Investigation of Ancient Technology Evolution of Door Locking Mechanisms in S.E. Mediterranean," ''Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry'' 16, no. 1: 43-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman civilization was highly urbanized by pre-modern standards. Many cities of the [[Roman Empire]] had over 100,000 inhabitants with the capital Rome being the largest metropolis of antiquity. Features of Roman urban life included multistory apartment buildings called [[Insula (building)|insulae]], street paving, public flush toilets, glass windows and [[Hypocaust|floor and wall heating]]. The Romans understood [[hydraulics]] and constructed [[fountain]]s and waterworks, particularly [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, which were the hallmark of their civilization. They exploited water power by building [[water mill]]s, sometimes in series, such as the sequence found at [[Barbegal]] in southern France and suspected on the [[Janiculum]] in Rome. Some [[Thermae|Roman baths]] have lasted to this day. The Romans developed many technologies which were apparently lost in the [[Middle Ages]], and were only fully reinvented in the 19th and 20th centuries. They also left texts describing their achievements, especially [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Frontinus]] and [[Vitruvius]].

Other less known Roman innovations include [[cement]], boat mills, arch [[dam]]s and possibly [[tide mill]]s.

== Mesoamerica &amp; Andean Region ==
Lacking suitable beasts of burden and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground acqeducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |title=Maya plumbing, first pressurized water feature found in New World |author=A’ndrea Messer |date=February 8, 2011 |website=Penn State News |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208225152/http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; road ways and complex terracing.

The Native Americans developed a complex understanding of the chemical properties or utility of natural substances, with the result that a majority of the world's early medicinal drugs and edible crops, many important adhesives, paints, fibres, plasters, and other useful items were the products of these civilizations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Perhaps the best-known Mesoamerican invention was rubber, which was used to create rubber bands, rubber bindings, balls, syringes, 'raincoats,' boots, and waterproof insulation on containers and flasks.

'''Hemming''' is a technology used in the [[automotive]] industry to join inner and outer closure [[wikt:panel|panels]] together (hoods, doors, tailgates, etc.). It is the process of bending/folding the flange of the outer panel over the inner one. The accuracy of the operation significantly affects the appearance of the [[car]]’s outer surfaces and is therefore a critical factor in the final quality of a finished [[vehicle]].

==Hemming processes==

===Press hemming===
Hemming presses are widely used in automotive manufacturing for hemming of [[sheet-metal]] body components. The process uses traditional hydraulically operated ‘stamping presses’ to hem closure parts and being the last forming process in [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], it determines the external quality of automotive outer parts such as doors, hood and trunk-lid.

====Hemming press features and benefits====
* Die storage systems
* Fully automatic die-changing systems with parameters that change with each die
* Pressing capacity typically 60 to 180 tons
* Large panel size capacity
* More than one part can be produced on same line
* Electric hemmers do not need hydraulic oil, are quiet and eco-friendly

====Hemming press limitations====
* Restricted to flat un-complicated panel profiles
* High cost

===Table top hemming===
Tabletop hemming machines are utilised for the manufacture of medium to high production volumes, with the ability to achieve cycle times as low as 15 seconds.

====Table top features and benefits====
* Optimum panel quality guaranteed through the hemming principle of the closed ring

====Table top limitations====
* Dedicated to one panel
* Relatively high cost
* Cost lower than press hem, but higher than robot roller hem

===Robot (roller hemming)===

[[Robot]] hemming is utilized for the manufacture of Low to medium production volumes.It uses a standard [[industrial robot]] integrated with a roller hemming head to provide a flexible solution to closure manufacture. The flange of the outer panel is bent over the inner panel in progressive steps by means of the roller hemming head. The process allows the advantage of using the robot controlled hemming head to hem several different components in a single cell. Minor changes and modifications to panel hemming conditions can also be accommodated allowing a quick and cost-effective reaction.

The robot can also be used for other tasks, by, for example, equipping it with a tool changing system. This will allow it to also operate dispensing equipment for adhesives and sealants, or a gripper which will enable it to carry out panel manipulation within the assembly cell.

====Robot hemming features and benefits====
* The ideal solution for all volume production demands, via multiple robots and split operations
* Overall quality better than press or tabletop with MBE hemming technologies implemented 
* Flexibility:
** Robot can hem various panel shapes that press and tabletop can't achieve due to flange attack angles and physical accessibility
** Can perform panel shape changes via quick program changes, while saving the original programs for future recall
** Can perform other tasks by changing the hemming tool with another tool such as a dispensing nozzle 
* Low cost, simple and quiet in operation when used with standard industrial robot 
* Reduced mechanical effort for tryout

The theory was first described by [[William Bateson]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=William|title=Heredity and variation in modern lights|journal=Darwin and Modern Science|year=1909|pages=85–101|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511693953.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; then independently described by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobzhansky |first=Theodosius |title=Studies on Hybrid Sterility. I. Spermatogenesis in pure and hybrid ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' |journal=Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und mikroskopische Anatomie |year=1934 |volume=21 |pages=169–221 |url=http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=k8473n7380186x54&amp;size=largest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327043844/http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=k8473n7380186x54&amp;size=largest |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= |doi=10.1007/bf00374056}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later elaborated in different forms by [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Herman Muller]],  [[H.

The model states that genetic incompatibility is most likely evolved by alternative fixation of two or more loci instead of just one, so that when hybridization occurs, it is the first time for some of the alleles to co-occur in the same individual. For example, imagine two populations that only recently separated geographically. Both sides are starting with the same genotype ''AABB''. One population can then evolve to ''aaBB'', through the transition state ''AaBB'', while the other evolves to ''AAbb'', through the transition state ''AABb''. During these processes, ''a'' allele will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, and ''b'' will co-occur with ''A'' and ''B'' alleles, without fitness consequences. When hybridization occurs, it is the first time ''a'' and ''b'' alleles co-occur, and they are the alleles that are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution|author=[[Douglas J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13565">'''Behavioral plasticity''' refers to a change in an organism's behavior that results from exposure to stimuli, such as changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Behavioral plasticity definition"/&gt; Behavior can change more rapidly in response to changes in internal or external stimuli than is the case for most morphological traits and many physiological traits. As a result, when organisms are confronted by new conditions, behavioral changes often occur in advance of physiological or morphological changes. For instance, larval amphibians changed their antipredator behavior within an hour after a change in cues from predators, but morphological changes in body and tail shape in response to the same cues required a week to complete.&lt;ref name="OrizaolaDahl2012"/&gt;

==Background==

For many years, ethologists have studied the ways that behavior can change in response to changes in external stimuli or changes in the internal state of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tinbergen|first1=Niko|title=The study of Instinct|date=1951|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-501371-9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel literature, psychologists studying learning and cognition have spent years documenting the many ways that experiences in the past can affect the behavior an individual expresses at the current time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shettleworth|first1=Sarah|title=Cognition, Evolution and Behavior|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531984-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in behavioral plasticity gained prominence more recently as an example of a type of [[phenotypic plasticity]] with major consequences for evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=West-Ebberhard/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Snell-Rood"/&gt;

==Types==
Behavioral plasticity can be broadly organized into two types: exogenous and endogenous.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt; Exogenous plasticity refers to the changes in [[behavioral phenotype]] (i.e., observable behaviors) caused by an external stimuli, experience, or environment. Endogenous plasticity encompasses plastic responses that result from changes in internal cues, such as [[genotype]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, and [[menstruation]].

These two broad categories can be further broken down into two other important classifications. When an external stimuli elicits or "activates" an immediate response (an immediate effect on behavior), then the organism is demonstrating contextual plasticity.&lt;ref name="Snell-Rood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt;  This form of plasticity highlights the concept that external stimuli in a given context activate [[Nervous system|neural]] and [[Hormone|hormonal]] mechanisms or pathways which already exist inside the organism.&lt;ref name="Snell-Rood" /&gt; In contrast, if an organism's current behavior is altered by past experiences, then the animal is said to be exhibiting developmental or "innate" behavioral plasticity.&lt;ref name=Mery/&gt; This form of plasticity is generally thought to require new neuronal pathways to form.

Developmental behavioral plasticity corresponds to the commonly used definition of plasticity: a single genotype can express more than one behavioral phenotype as a result of different developmental routes triggered by differences in past experiences. Developmental plasticity thus includes what is referred to as "[[learning]]". However, developmental plasticity also includes developmental changes in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[physiology]] relevant to a particular behavior, such as changes in muscles, limbs, or bones that influence foraging or locomotion throughout and organism's life.&lt;ref name=Snell-Rood/&gt;

A major difference between developmental and contextual plasticity is the inherent trade-off between the time of interpreting a stimuli and exhibiting a behavior. Contextual plasticity is a near immediate response to the environment. The underlying hormonal networks/neuronal pathways are already present, so it is only a matter of activating them. In contrast, developmental plasticity requires internal changes in hormonal networks and neuronal pathways. As a result, developmental plasticity is often, although not always, a slower process than contextual plasticity. For instance, [[habituation]] is a type of learning (developmental plasticity) that can occur within a short period of time. One of the advantages of developmental behavioral plasticity that occurs over extended periods of time is that such changes can occur in concert with changes in morphological and physiological traits. In such cases, the same set of external or internal stimuli can lead to coordinated changes in suites of behavioral, morphological and physiological traits.

==Examples==
Contextual plasticity is typically studied by presenting the same individual with different external stimuli, and then recording their responses to each stimulus. For instance, [[ant]]s can rapidly alter their running speed in response to changes in the external temperature.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt; Another example of contextual plasticity occurs when birds change their vocalizations in response to changes in the pitch or intensity of background noise. Contextual plasticity plays a major role in studies of [[mate preference]], in which each subject is exposed to cues from different mates, and its response to each cue is quantified. In this case, a stronger attractive response to a particular cue is assumed to reflect a preference for mates with that cue.

Developmental plasticity encompasses the many ways that experiences in an organism's past can affect its current behavior. Developmental plasticity thus includes learning, acclimation, and any situation in which environmental conditions early in life affects the behavior expressed later in life (also called ontogenetic plasticity.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt;  Since a given individual can only be raised under one set of conditions, ontogenetic plasticity is studied by dividing matched individuals into two or more groups, and then rearing each group under a different set of conditions. For instance, this experimental design was used to demonstrate that the density at which moth larvae were raised affected the courtship signals that they produced as adults.&lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt; 
Endogenous plasticity includes [[circadian rhythm]]s, circannual rhythms, and age-dependent changes in behavior. A good example of endogenous plasticity occurs with [[zebrafish]] (''Danio rerio''). Larval zebrafish exhibit circadian rhythms in their responsiveness to light. Even when they are maintained under continuous darkness, the fish are much more responsive to changes in light (i.e. higher contextual plasticity) during subjective day than during subjective night.&lt;ref name=Emran/&gt; Another example involves the changes in an individual's behavior and hormonal profile around the time of [[sexual maturity]]; such changes are affected changes in physiology that occurred months to years earlier in life.&lt;ref name=Snell-Rood/&gt;

==Potential vs. realized plasticity==
A useful distinction to make when looking at behavioral plasticity is between potential and realized plasticity. Potential plasticity refers to the ability of a given phenotypic trait to vary in its response to variation in stimuli, experiences, or environmental conditions. Thus, potential plasticity is the theoretical range in behavioral plasticity that could be expressed. This value is never truly known, but serves more as a baseline in plasticity models. Realized plasticity, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which a given phenotype actually varies in response to changes in a specific stimulus, experience, or environmental condition.

== Individual differences in behavioral plasticity ==

Recent studies of animals have documented individual differences in virtually all of the different types of behavioral plasticities described above.&lt;ref name="Stamps2016"/&gt; In addition, behavioral plasticities may themselves be developmentally plastic: individual differences in a type of plasticity that is expressed at a given age may be affected by the conditions to which the subjects were exposed earlier in life. In a variety of species, for instance, social cues during the juvenile period affect the contextual plasticity of responses to cues from potential mates at adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodríguez|first1=Rafael|title=The evolution and evolutionary consequences of social plasticity in mate preferences|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2013|volume=85|pages=1041–1047|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case for many other types of plasticity, researchers studying the development of individual differences in behavioral plasticity have found that genes, prior experiences and interactions between these factors contribute to the individual differences in behavioral plasticity that are expressed at a given age or lifestage. Another question that is currently attracting interest from students of both animal and human behavior is whether different types of behavioral plasticities are correlated with one another across individuals: i.e., whether some individuals are generally more plastic than others. Although there is some evidence that certain types of cognitive traits tend to be positively correlated with one another across individuals (see the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] in humans), at present there is scant evidence that other types of plasticity (e.g. contextual plasticity and ontogenetic plasticity) are correlated with one another across individuals or genotypes in humans or animals. 
 
==Evolutionary causes and consequences==
Behavioral plasticity can have major impacts on the [[evolution]]ary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of an individual. Both developmental and contextual plasticity influence the fitness of an animal in a novel environment by increasing the probability that the animal will survive in that environment. Developmental plasticity is particularly important in terms of survival in novel environments, because trial-and-error processes such as learning (which encompass both phenotype sampling and environmental feedback) have the ability to immediately shift an entire population close to a new adaptive norm. As such, the ability to express some level of behavioral plasticity can be very advantageous. In fluctuating environments, animals that can change how they respond to differences in stimuli would have a leg up over animals that were set in a rigid phenotype. However, this would only be the case if the costs of maintaining the ability to change phenotype was lower than the benefit conferred to the individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">[[File:J0737-3039 still1 large.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a binary pulsar]]
A '''binary pulsar''' is a [[pulsar]] with a [[binary star|binary companion]], often a [[white dwarf]] or [[neutron star]]. (In at least one case, the double pulsar [[PSR J0737-3039]], the companion neutron star is another pulsar as well.)  Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test [[general relativity]] because of the strong gravitational fields in their vicinities. Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe directly, its presence can be deduced from the timing of the pulses from the pulsar itself, which can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by [[radio telescope]]s.

==History==
The first binary pulsar, [[PSR B1913+16]] or the "Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar" was discovered in 1974 at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] by [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.]] and [[Russell Hulse]], for which they won the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. While Hulse was observing the newly discovered pulsar PSR B1913+16, he noticed that the rate at which it pulsed varied regularly. It was concluded  that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity, and that the pulse period was varying due to the Doppler effect: As the pulsar was moving towards Earth, the pulses would be more frequent; and  conversely, as it moved away from Earth fewer would be detected in a given time period. One can think of the pulses like the ticks of a clock; changes in the ticking are indications of changes in the pulsars speed toward and away from Earth. Hulse and Taylor also determined that the stars were approximately equally massive by observing these pulse fluctuations, which led them to believe the other  object was also a neutron star. Pulses from this system are now tracked to within 15 [[microsecond|μs]].&lt;ref name="wet2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | year=  2010| title=Timing Measurements of the Relativistic Binary Pulsar PSR B1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 722 |  pages=1030–1034 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1030 | arxiv =  1011.0718v1 | bibcode=2010ApJ...722.1030W
 | last3 = Taylor | first3 = J. H. | last2 = Nice | first2 = D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the PSR B1913+16 binary pulsar also led to the first accurate determination of neutron star masses, using relativistic timing effects.&lt;ref name="wt82"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. |last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1982| title=A new test of general relativity - Gravitational radiation and the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 253 |  pages=908–920 | doi=10.1086/159690 | bibcode=1982ApJ...253..908T }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two bodies are in close proximity, the gravitational field is stronger, the passage of time is slowed – and the time between pulses (or ticks) is lengthened. Then as the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time. A special relativistic effect, time dilation, acts around the orbit in a similar fashion.  This relativistic time delay is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion in a circular orbit, and what is actually observed.

Prior to [[First observation of gravitational waves|2015]] and the operation of [[LIGO|Advanced LIGO]],&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P.  |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys. Rev.

A  10-parameter model incorporating information about the pulsar timing, the [[Kepler's laws|Keplerian]] orbits and three post-Keplerian corrections (the rate of [[periastron]] advance,  a factor for [[gravitational redshift]] and [[time dilation]], and a rate of change of the orbital period from [[gravitational radiation]] emission) is sufficient to completely model the binary pulsar timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | date=  October 1981| title=Gravitational waves from an orbiting pulsar | journal=Scientific American | volume = 245 |  pages=74–82 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-74 | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d..74W |  last2 = Taylor | first2 = J.

The measurements made of the orbital decay of the PSR B1913+16 system were a near perfect match to Einstein's equations. Relativity predicts that over time a binary system's orbital energy will be converted to [[gravitational radiation]]. Data collected by Taylor and Joel M. Weisberg and their colleagues of the orbital period of PSR B1913+16 supported this relativistic prediction; they reported in 1982&lt;ref name="wt82"/&gt; and subsequently&lt;ref name="wet2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. | last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1989| title=Further experimental tests of relativistic gravity using the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 345 |  pages=434–450 | doi=10.1086/167917 | bibcode=1989ApJ...345..434T }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant. In the decade following its discovery the system's orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year - this means that the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same. Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease.

==Effects==
Sometimes the relatively normal companion star of a binary pulsar will swell up to the point that it dumps its outer layers onto the pulsar. This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X-ray light which can appear to pulsate, in a process called the [[X-ray binary]] stage. The flow of matter from one stellar body to another often leads to the creation of an [[accretion disk]] about the recipient star.

[[Pulsar]]s also create a  "wind" of relativistically outflowing particles, which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the [[magnetosphere]] of their companions and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission.

The '''bioecological model''' is a theoretical model of [[gene–environment interaction]]s in [[Developmental psychology|human development]]. This model, first proposed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] and [[Stephen J. Ceci]],&lt;ref name="bronceci"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bronfenbrenner U, Ceci SJ |title=Nature-nurture reconceptualized in developmental perspective: a bioecological model |journal=Psychological Review |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=568–586 |date=October 1994 |pmid=7984707 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.568}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994, is an extension of Bronfenbrenner's original theoretical model of human development, called [[ecological systems theory]]. Bronfenbrenner developed the bioecological model after recognizing that the individual was overlooked in other theories of human development, which were largely focused on the context of development (e.g., the environment).

The bioecological model of human development can be applied to both children and maturing adults, and is thus a lifespan approach to development. The framework emphasizes the importance of understanding bidirectional influences between individuals’ development and their surrounding environmental contexts.In the bioecological model, in contrast to his earlier models, Bronfenbrenner also includes time (known as the chronosystem in his model) as an important component in the way that people and environments change. The bioecological model proposed a new method of conducting research which was heavily influential in [[developmental psychology]] and is still considered relevant today.

== The original model ==
Bronfenbrenner named his original model "[[Ecological Systems Theory]]". Through this framework, Bronfenbrenner identified the need to understand individuals’ development within their environments. In order to conceptualize environmental contexts, Bronfenbrenner described four ecological systems:
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Urie Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Urie Bronfenbrenner's Model.]] --&gt;
# ''Microsystem'': The microsystem is the innermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This context is closest to an individual and encompasses interpersonal relationships and direct interactions with immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name="microsystem"&gt;Berk, L.E. (2000). Child Development (5th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, 23-28. {{ISBN|0205286348}} https://openlibrary.org/books/OL35893M/Child_development&lt;/ref&gt; For example, family members and a child's school are considered part of the microsystem.
# ''Mesosystem'': The mesosystem includes interactions between various aspects of the microsystem. A relationship between a child's family and the child's school can be considered part of the mesosystem, because these two direct influences (parts of the microsystem) may interact.
# ''Exosystem'': The exosystem does not directly affect individuals; rather, the exosystem encompasses aspects of structures within the microsystem.&lt;ref name="microsystem" /&gt; For example, financial difficulties within the family of origin, parental job loss, and so forth may affect a child, but do not involve the child directly.
# ''Macrosystem'': The macrosystem is the outermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This system includes social or cultural ideologies and beliefs that affect an individual's environment.&lt;ref name=bergen&gt;{{cite book|author=Bergen, D. |title=Human development:  traditional and contemporary theories |year=2008 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0131343971 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, laws may be incorporated into the macrosystem.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt;
# ''Chronosystem:''Bronfenbrenner suggested that individuals constantly interact with these systems. He also stated that both individuals and their environments constantly affect one another.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; However, in this original model, Bronfenbrenner recognized there was not enough focus on individuals’ own role in their development,&lt;ref name="tudge"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tudge, J.R.H. |author2=Mokrova, I. |author3=Hatfield, B.E. |author4= Karnik, R.B. |year=2009 |title=Uses and misuses of Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological theory of human development |journal=Journal of Family Theory and Review |volume=1 |pages=198–210|url= http://www.uncg.edu/hdf/facultystaff/Tudge/Tudge,%20Mokrova,%20Hatfield,%20%26%20Karnik,%202009.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2589.2009.00026.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus began further developing this model.

== Evolution of Bronfenbrenner's theory ==
Bronfenbrenner informally discussed new ideas concerning [[Ecological Systems Theory]] throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s during lectures and presentations to the psychological community.&lt;ref name=bron&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Urie Bronfenbrenner  |author2=Morris, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title= The bioecological model of human development |journal=Handbook of Child Psychology |volume=1 |pages= 793–828 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi= 10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0114}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he examined his original theory, he began to identify the role of other key factors in development. In 1986, Bronfenbrenner published his new theory and named it Bioecological Systems Theory.&lt;ref name=bronf&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bronfenbrenner, U. |author2= Morris, P.A. |title= The ecology of developmental processes |year=1998 |journal=Handbook of Child Psychology |volume=1 |location=New York |isbn=0-471-05527-1 |pages=993–1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Bronfenbrenner's main influences was [[Lev Vygotsky]], a Russian teacher and psychologist. Vygotsky created the [[Observational learning|social learning]] theory of development in the 1920s and 1930s to understand how people learn in social contexts and how social environments influence the learning process (1962). Vygotsky recognized that learning always occurs and cannot be separated from a social context and that this process is integral to a child's development.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, L. S. (n.d.). [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/lsn/educator/edtech/learningtheorieswebsite/vygotsky.htm Lev Vygotsky and social learning theories].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Lewin]], a German forerunner of ecological systems models and the founder of modern [[social psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Greathouse, J. (1997, May). Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Psychology History website:  http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/lewin.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814001331/http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/lewin.htm |date=2012-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the use of theory and experimentation to test hypotheses. He focused on the life space, which he defined as a person's psychological activities that occur within a kind of psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Kneessi, D. F. (2002). Bioscopes: Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Kurt Lewin website:   http://faculty.frostburg.edu/mbradley/psyography/bioscopes_kurtlewin.html&lt;/ref&gt; The life space that contains all the events in the past, present, and future that shape and affect an individual. This focus on individuality led him to diagram the life space, containing arrows leading to and from possible life goals, both positive and negative. In sum, Lewin's ecological systems model emphasized situational and proximal causes. Additionally, Lewin's theory demonstrates that behavior is a function of the current person by their environment, which are all affected by past experience.

Bronfenbrenner was also influenced by his colleague, [[Stephen J. Ceci]], with whom he co-authored the article “Nature-nurture reconceptualized in developmental perspective: A bioecological theory” in 1994.&lt;ref name="bronceci" /&gt; Ceci is a developmental psychologist who redefined modern developmental psychology's approach to intellectual development. He focused on predicting a pattern of associations among ecological, genetic, and cognitive variables as a function of proximal processes. Together, Bronfenbrenner and Ceci published the beginnings of the bioecological model and made it an accessible framework to use in understanding developmental processes.&lt;ref name="bronceci" /&gt;

== History ==
The history of bioecological systems theory is divided into two periods. The first period resulted in the publication of Bronfenbrenner's theory of ecological systems theory, titled ''The Ecology of Human Development'', in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8cf0FYm0jW0C The Ecology of Human Development:  Experiments by nature and design]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1-348. {{ISBN|0674224574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronfenbrenner described the second period as a time of criticism and evaluation of his original work.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt;

The development of ecological systems theory arose because Bronfenbrenner noted a lack of focus on the role of context in terms of development. He argued the environment in which children operate is important because development may be shaped by their interactions with the specific environment. He urged his colleagues to study development in terms of ecological contexts, that is the normal environments of children (schools, homes, daycares). Researchers heeded his advice and a great deal of research flourished in the early 1980s that focused on context.

However, where prior research was ignoring context, Bronfenbrenner felt current research focused too much on context and ignored development. In his justification for a new theory, Bronfenbrenner wrote he was not pleased with the direction of research in the mid 1980s and that he felt there were other realms of development that were overlooked.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;

In comparison to the original theory, bioecological systems theory adds more emphasis to the person in the context of development. Additionally, Bronfenbrenner chose to leave out key features of the ecological systems theory (e.g., [[ecological validity]] and ecological experiments) during his development of bioecological systems theory.  As a whole, Bronfenbrenner's new theory continued to go through a series of transformations as he continuously analyzed different factors in human development. Critical components of bioecological systems theory did not emerge all at once. Instead, his ideas evolved and adapted to the research and ideas of the times.  For example, the role of proximal processes, which is now recognized as a key feature of bioecological systems theory, did not emerge until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; This theory went through a series of transformations and elaborations until 2005 when Bronfenbrenner died.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

== Process–Person–Context–Time ==
Bronfenbrenner further developed the model by adding the chronosystem, which refers to how the person and environments change over time. He also placed a greater emphasis on processes and the role of the biological person. The Process–Person–Context–Time Model (PPCT) has since become the bedrock of the bioecological model. PPCT includes four concepts. The interactions between the concepts form the basis for the theory.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;

: 1. Process - Bronfenbrenner viewed proximal processes as the primary mechanism for development, featuring them in two central propositions of the bioecological model.

::::''Proposition 1'': [H]uman development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the persons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a fairly regular basis over extended periods of time. Such enduring forms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred to as proximal processes.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

::Proximal processes are the development processes of systematic interaction between person and environment.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; Bronfenbrenner identifies group and solitary activities such as playing with other children or reading as mechanisms through which children come to understand their world and formulate ideas about their place within it.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; However, processes function differently depending on the person and the context.

::::''Proposition 2:'' The form, power, content, and direction of the proximal processes effecting development vary systematically as a joint function of the characteristics of the developing person; of the environment—both immediate and more remote—in which the processes are taking place; the nature of the developmental outcomes under consideration; and the social continuities and changes occurring over time through the life course and the historical period during which the person has lived.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

: 2. Person – Bronfenbrenner acknowledged the role that personal characteristics of individuals play in social interactions.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt; He identified three personal characteristics that can significantly influence proximal processes across the lifespan. Demand characteristics such as age, gender or physical appearance set processes in motion, acting as “personal stimulus” characteristics.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Resource characteristics are not as immediately recognizable and include mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, intelligence, and skills as well as material resources such as access to housing, education, and responsive caregivers.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt; Force characteristics are related to variations in motivation, persistence and temperament. Bronfenbrenner notes that even when children have equivalent access to resources, their developmental courses may differ as a function of characteristics such as drive to succeed and persistence in the face of hardship. In doing this, Bronfenbrenner provides a rationale for how environments (i.e., the systems mentioned above under “The Original Model: Ecological Systems Theory”) influence personal characteristics, yet also suggests personal characteristics can change environments.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt;

: 3. Context  - Context involves five interconnected systems, which are based on Bronfenbrenner’s original model, ecological systems theory. The microsystem describes environments such as home or school in which children spend significant time interacting. Mesosystems are interrelations between microsystems. The exosystem describes events that have important indirect influence on development (e.g., a parent consistently working late).&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; The macrosystem is a feature of any group (culture, subculture) that share values and belief systems. The chronosystem describes historical circumstances that affect contexts at all other levels.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

: 4. Time – Time has a prominent place in this developmental model. It is constituted at three levels: micro, meso, and macro. Micro-time refers to what is happening during specific episodes of proximal processes. Meso-time refers to the extent to which the processes occur in the person’s environment, such as over the course of days, weeks or years.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Macro-time (or the chronosystem) focuses on the shifting expectancies in wider culture. This functions both within and across generations and affects proximal processes across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;
 	
Thus, the bioecological model highlights the importance of understanding a person's development within environmental systems. It further explains that both the person and the environment affect one another bidirectionally. Although even Bronfenbrenner himself critiqued the falsifiability of the model,&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; the bioecological model has real world applications for developmental research, practice, and policies (as demonstrated below).

== Research implications ==
In addition to adding to the theoretical understanding of human development, the bioecological model lends itself to changes in the conceptualization of the research endeavor. In some of his earliest comments on the state of developmental research, Bronfenbrenner lamented that developmental research concerned itself with studying “strange behavior of children in strange situations for the briefest possible period of time”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bronfenbrenner, U. |year=1974 |title=Developmental research, public policy, and the ecology of childhood |journal=Child Development |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |publisher=Wiley |doi=10.2307/1127743 |jstor=1127743}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed, rather, that developmental science should take as its goal a study of children in context in order to best determine which processes are naturally “developmentally generative” (promote development) and which are naturally “developmentally disruptive” (prevent development).

Bronfenbrenner set up a contrast to the traditional “confirmatory” approach to hypothesis testing (in which research is done to “confirm” that a hypothesis is correct or incorrect) when specifying the types of research needed to support the bioecological model of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bronfenbrenner, U. |year=2005 |title=Making human beings human: Bioecological perspectives on human development |pages=3–15 |publisher=Sage Publications Ltd |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 0-7619-2711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bronfenbrenner's view, the dynamic nature of the model calls for “primarily generative” research designs that explore interactions between proximal processes (see Proposition 1) and the developing person, environment, time, and developmental outcome (Proposition 2).  Bronfenbrenner called this type of research the “discovery mode” of developmental science.

To best capture such dynamic processes, developmental research designs would ideally be [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] (over time), rather than [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] (a single point in time), and conducted in children's natural environments, rather than a laboratory. Such designs would thus occur in schools, homes, day-care centers, and other environments in which proximal processes are most likely to occur. The bioecological model also proposes that the most scientifically rich studies would include more than one distinct but theoretically related proximal process in the same design.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt; Indeed, studies that claim to be based upon bioecological theory should include elements of process, person, context, and time, and should include explicit explanation and acknowledgement if one of the elements is lacking.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Based on the interactions of proposed elements of the PPCT model, appropriate statistical analyses of PPCT data would likely include explorations of mediation and moderation effects, as well as multilevel modeling of data to account for the nesting of different components of the model. Moreover, research that includes both genetic and environmental components would capture even more of the bioecological model's elements.

== Role of technology ==
In today's interconnected world, communication and electronic devices have a huge effect on the micro-cellular structure and complex bio-chemistry of our brains which eventually affects our personality, behavior and characteristics. A research conducted by Harvard medical school, highlighted the power of human imagination and the structural changes it causes to the human brain at the micro-cellular level thus bringing about changes in character personality or behaviour.  The scientist argues that if imagination could bring about such permanent changes in the brain, the effects of digital technology on a human brain can produce behavioural changes such as shorter attention span, reduction in communication skills and abstract thinking. However, there is enough research to prove the positive effects of ‘brain-training’ computer games aimed at keeping the brain cells active. (Greenfield, 2014, #13)

According to technology writer Nicholas Carr, technology has always determined the development of the brain and the way we think throughout History. As he illustrates with examples of reading and the rise in the use of internet. He observes that development of reading habits motivated our brains to be concentrate on the text and imagine, whereas the over exposure of internet reinforce our capability to scan and filter information productively and easily. (Taylor, 2012, #14)
Attention is the key requisite which paves the way to all aspects of learning viz. perception, memory, language, creativity, reasoning, problem solving and decision making. Attention has been considered to be a highly malleable quality which can be influenced by the environment. Research shows that the invention of digital entertainment changed the attention span by presenting children with visual stimuli and very little need of imagination. In such an environment distraction becomes the norm and memory, focusing gets affected. This is in sharp contradiction to the children of the past who spent a great amount of their time reading, which requires deep and consistent attention, imagination, memory and which gave way to minimal distractions. (Taylor, 2012, #14)

However studies have shown that a visual media improves visual-spatial capabilities (Green, Bavelier 2010, #15) and capacity to identify relevant information in text filled with hyperlinks and ads. Thus technology maybe making children viewing information differently compared to the children of yesteryear. In short children are more skilled at remembering where to find information rather than remembering information itself. Thus the brain may be allowed to be involved in higher order activities such as contemplation, critical thinking and problem solving. (Taylor, 2012, #14)

'''Feel / ability to empathize''' 
According to a study on two groups of sixth-graders, kids who had no access to electronic devices for five days picked up on emotions and non-verbal cues better than those who used their devices during that time. (De Loatch, 2015, #16)

== Ecological techno subsystem ==

Ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) emerged before the advent of Internet revolution and the developmental influence of then available technology (e.g., television) was conceptually situated in the child's microsystem. Johnson and Puplampu (2008) proposed the ecological techno-subsystem, a dimension of the microsystem. Ecological techno-subsystem, a refinement to Bronfenbrenner's theoretical organization of environmental influences on child development.

The word ecological techno-subsystem comprises both child interaction with living (e.g., peers, parents, teachers) and non-living (e.g., hardware, gadgets) elements of communication, information, and recreation technologies in immediate or direct environments.

An experimental study of 128 children from first to sixth grade was conducted to assess their cognitive development, based on their use of internet at home and socioeconomic characteristics of the family.

'''Measures and Results''' 
Three constructs, corresponding to three ecological systems/subsystems, were measured: child cognitive development (bioecology), indices of child use of the Internet at home (techno-subsystem), and family socioeconomic characteristics (microsystem).

For the chosen sample of children, both father's education and mother's employment were associated with measures of child cognitive development. Educated fathers tended to have children who scored high on three of the four cognitive measures (expressive language, visual perception, and auditory memory) as they may provide enhanced language models and stimulating learning environments to their children. Employed  mothers  tended to have children who had high scores on the measure of metacognitive planning as they could train their children to develop internet usage skills  and effective  management of  information .

The indices of  use of internet at home accounted for more variance in their development than the indices of socioeconomic status. The ecological techno-subsystem improves our understanding of the influences of environment on child development by stressing the effect of digital technologies on cognitive growth during childhood.

While Internet use during childhood has been associated with negative developmental outcomes, research increasingly suggests that the Internet provides children with more developmental advantages than disadvantages ''(Greenfield &amp; Yan, 2006).''

The Internet, although rich in graphic display, is primarily a text-based medium; “the more a child uses the Internet, the more he/she reads” ''(Jackson et al., 2007, p. 188)''. Exposure to computer during the preschool years increased school readiness later ''(Li and Atkins (2004).''

Jackson and colleagues (2006) provided low income children with home-based Internet access and continuously recorded time online. Their findings indicated that children who used the Internet more had higher scores on standardized tests of reading achievement and higher grade point compared to those children who used the Internet less (p.&amp;nbsp;429).

From a developmental perspective, Internet use stimulates cognitive processes involved in interpreting text and images ''(Johnson, 2006).'' Metacognitive processes such as planning, search strategies, and evaluation of information are exercised when navigating websites ''(Tarpley, 2001).'' ''DeBell and Chapman (2006)'' concluded that Internet use promotes cognitive development in children, “specifically in the area of visual intelligence, where certain computer activities -- particularly games -- may enhance the ability to monitor several visual stimuli at once, to read diagrams, recognize icons, and visualize spatial relationships” (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

Comprehensive theoretical description of the developmental effect of Internet use is required. The recently proposed ecological techno-subsystem ''(Johnson &amp; Puplampu, 2008)'' provides a conceptual framework for understanding the effect of Internet use on child development.

'''Biomechanical engineering''' is a [[bioengineering]] subdiscipline, which applies principles of [[mechanical engineering]] to [[biological systems]] and stems from the scientific discipline of [[biomechanics]]. Topics of interest in the field include [[biomedical engineering]] and [[agricultural engineering]]. '''[[Biomechanics]], specifically,''' is the study of biological systems such as the human body, combined with the study of mechanics, or mechanical applications. Using the skills learned from biology, engineering and physics to research and develop for health care, such as organs that have been made from artificial materials, or new advances with prosthetic limbs. The creation of [[biomaterial]], which is a fake material that can be integrated into living tissue or can live in sync with biological material, is one of the biggest advances in medicine to this day. Those in this field might also hold the job of not only installing, but also adjusting, maintain, repairing, and providing technical help for all the biomaterial.

Radio '''Blanketing Interference''' is a term used predominantly in the USA to refer to [[Blocking (radio)|Receiver Blocking]] which is [[Interference (communication)|interference]] caused when a strong unwanted off-channel [[radio]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] prevents the reception of another (wanted) transmission.  

This problem is greatly reduced by even moderate-quality [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], which have better [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] (filtering) and [[dynamic range]] than poorly designed inexpensive or [[disposable]] ones.

Perowne exercised limited editorial control over the writers of individual commentaries: his aim was "to leave each contributor to the unfettered exercise of his own judgment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cambridgebiblef00unkngoog Preface by the General Editor], accessed 12 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cellular agriculture''' focuses on the production of agriculture products from cell cultures using a combination of [[biotechnology]], [[tissue engineering]], [[molecular biology]], and [[synthetic biology]] to create and design new methods of producing proteins, fats, and tissues that would otherwise come from traditional agriculture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agfundernews.com/closer-look-cellular-agriculture-and-the-processes-defining-it.html|title=A Closer Look at Cellular Agriculture and the Processes Defining It - AgFunderNews|date=2016-07-05|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the creation of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs, produced in cell culture rather than raising and slaughtering farmed livestock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|title=Cellular agriculture: The coming revolution in food production|journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|pages = 32–35|volume = 74|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|first = CS|last = Mattick|pmid=10659856|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known cellular agriculture concept is [[cultured meat]].

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of cellular agriculture}}

Although cellular agriculture is a nascent scientific discipline, cellular agriculture products were first commercialized in the early 20th century with insulin and rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=About|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1990, the FDA approved a bacteria that had been genetically engineered to produce rennet, making it the first genetically engineered product for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-24/news/mn-681_1_genetically-engineered-product-for-food|title=FDA approves 1st genetically engineered product for food|last=|first=|date=1990-03-24|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rennet is a mixture of enzymes that turns milk into curds and whey in cheese making.  Traditionally, rennet is extracted from the inner lining of the fourth stomach of calves. Today, cheese making processes use rennet enzymes from genetically engineered bacteria, fungi, or yeasts because they are unadulterated, more consistent, and less expensive than animal-derived rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|title=Case Studies: Chymosin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522102627/http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Jason Gaverick Matheny|Jason Matheny]] founded [[New Harvest]] which was initially a cultured-meat advocacy organization whose mission today is to "accelerate breakthroughs in cellular agriculture."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Harvest is the only organization focused exclusively on advancing the field of cellular agriculture and is funding the first cellular agriculture PhD at Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/cellular_agriculture_tufts_university|title=Cellular Agriculture at Tufts University.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, ''IndieBio'', a synthetic biology accelerator in San Francisco, has incubated several cellular agriculture startups, hosting Muufri (making milk from cell culture), Clara Foods (making egg whites from cell culture), Gelzen (making gelatin from bacteria and yeast), Afineur (making cultured coffee beans) and Pembient (biofabricating rhino horn). Muufri and Clara Foods were both launched by New Harvest.

In 2015, ''[[Mercy for Animals]]'' created its sister organization called ''[[The Good Food Institute|Good Food Institute]]'', which promotes cellular agriculture meat and dairy alternatives in addition to plant-based options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=7568&amp;catId=1|title=News article|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 13, 2016, New Harvest hosted the world's first international conference on cellular agriculture in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The day after the conference, New Harvest hosted the first closed-door workshop for industry, academic and government stakeholders in cellular agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@NewHarvestOrg/notes-from-the-2016-cellular-agriculture-innovators-workshop-c97d4df4eabb#.dow8i6r2m|title=Notes from the 2016 Cellular Agriculture Innovators’ Workshop|last=Harvest|first=New|date=2016-08-04|website=Medium|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research tools ==
Several key research tools are at the foundation of research in cellular agriculture. These include:

=== Cell lines ===
A fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Challenges and prospects for the establishment of embryonic stem cells of domesticated ungulates|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|volume=98|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.009|pmid=17097839|via=|pages=147–68 | last1 = Keefer | first1 = CL | last2 = Pant | first2 = D | last3 = Blomberg | first3 = L | last4 = Talbot | first4 = NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=The pursuit of ES cell lines of domesticated ungulates|journal=Stem Cell Rev|volume=4|issue=|doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9026-0|pmid=18612851|via=|pages=235–54 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = NC | last2 = Le Ann | first2 = Blomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Embryonic Stem Cells and Fetal Developmental Models|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|journal=Fetal Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=81–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include: immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability. The specific cell types most suitable for cellular agriculture are likely to differ from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013|title=Isolation and culture of bovine embryonic stem cells|journal=Epiblast Stem Cells|volume=1074|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-628-3_9|pmid=23975809|via=|pages=111–23 | last1 = Cao | first1 = S | last2 = Wang | first2 = F | last3 = Liu | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|title=Why is it so difficult to derive pluripotent stem cells in domestic ungulates?|pmid=22913556|journal=Reprod Domest Anim|volume=47 Suppl 5|issue=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0531.2012.02106.x|via=|pages=11–7 | last1 = Gandolfi | first1 = F | last2 = Pennarossa | first2 = G | last3 = Maffei | first3 = S | last4 = Brevini | first4 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth media ===
Today the status quo for growing animal tissue in culture involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource-heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van der Valk|first=J|date=2010|title=Optimization of chemically defined cell culture media--replacing fetal bovine serum in mammalian in vitro methods|journal=Toxicol In Vitro|volume=24|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2010.03.016|pmid=20362047|via=|pages=1053–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production. It is likely that two different media formulations will be required for each cell type: a proliferation media, for growth, and a differentiation media, for maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agapakis|first=Christina|date=2012|title=Steak of the Art: The Fatal Flaws of In Vitro Meat|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/04/24/steak-of-the-art-the-fatal-flaws-of-in-vitro-meat/#.V6jP-Vcw3zI|journal=Discover Magazine|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scaling technologies ===
As biotechnological processes are scaled, experiments start to become increasingly expensive, as bioreactors of increasing volume will have to be created. Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

=== Scaffold materials ===
For cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100&amp;nbsp;µm across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals.

=== 3D tissue systems ===
The final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need of serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.

== Applications ==
Cellular agriculture is a scientific field that designs new mechanisms to produce existing agriculture products. While the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Gingko Biowork's fragrances.

Over the last several years, several cellular agriculture start-ups have been created applying cellular agriculture to make a number of agricultural products and consumables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2448">'''Chemlink''' is a brand name for wireless video transmission products made by the Chung-Hsin Electric and Machinery Manufacturing Corporation (CHEM) Wireless Communication Division.

==Background==
The company is on a 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless transmission for audio and video. Not only OEM/ODM audio/video senders for many worldwide brand companies, also supply their video transmitter or receiver modules for the remote monitoring systems, wireless cameras or wireless [[CCTV]]s makers for professional and [[surveillance]] markets.

Wireless solutions make use of the 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz range to avoid interference from the increasingly crowded [[2.4GHz]] radio band, which is widely used by [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] [[802.11b/g]], [[Bluetooth]] devices, [[Cordless phone]]s and [[Microwave ovens]]. Therefore, 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz solutions are getting more and more public to use in home video transmission, especially in North America and Australia. In the security and surveillance markets, especially for long range video transmissions, more people are starting to use 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency for cleaner bandwidth for better outcome.

In 1956, Chung-Hsin Electric and Machinery Manufacturing Corp.(CHEM) was established. During the early years,the major scope of this company's business was focused on the manufacture of electric motors and generators. In 1970, they stepped into the market of home appliances including air-conditioners. Before long, they took the lead in the production of air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines in [[Taiwan]]. In 1983, operating with [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hitachi]], Japan, they successfully developed [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas insulated [[switchgear]] and gas insulated [[circuit breakers]]. Ten years later in 1993, in accordance with Taiwan government's policy, they actively participated in large-scaled, “Turn-Key,” engineering projects of the government. The total contract value was 18 billion [[NT dollar]]s. CHEM was transformed again in 2000. Since then, they have been engaged in RF [[Radio frequency]] and wireless communication manufacturing business. They started to use Chemlink as a brand name of their AV sender products line.

The '''single cell gel electrophoresis assay''' ('''SCGE''', also known as '''comet assay''') is an uncomplicated and sensitive technique for the detection of [[DNA damage]] at the level of the individual [[eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]. It was first developed by Östling &amp; Johansson in 1984 and later modified by Singh ''et al.'' in 1988. It has since increased in popularity as a standard technique for evaluation of DNA damage/repair, biomonitoring and genotoxicity testing. It involves the encapsulation of cells in a low-melting-point agarose suspension, lysis of the cells in neutral or alkaline (pH&gt;13) conditions, and electrophoresis of the suspended lysed cells. The term "comet" refers to the pattern of DNA migration through the electrophoresis gel, which often resembles a comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tice|first=R. R.|title=Single Cell Gel/Comet Assay: Guidelines for in vitro and in vivo Genetic Toxicology Testing|journal=Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis|year=2000|volume=35|issue=3|pages=206–21|pmid=10737956|doi=10.1002/(SICI)10982280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nandhakumar | first1 = S | last2 = Parasuraman | first2 = S | last3 = Shanmugam | first3 = M M | last4 = Rao | first4 = K R | last5 = Chand | first5 = P | last6 = Bhat | first6 = B V | year = 2011 | title = Evaluation of DNA damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet Assay) | journal = J Pharmacol Pharmacother | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 107–11 | pmid = 21772771 | doi=10.4103/0976-500X.81903 | pmc=3127337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) is a simple method for measuring deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. Cells embedded in agarose on a microscope slide are lysed with detergent and high salt to form nucleoids containing supercoiled loops of DNA linked to the nuclear matrix. Electrophoresis at high pH results in structures resembling comets, observed by fluorescence microscopy; the intensity of the comet tail relative to the head reflects the number of DNA breaks. The likely basis for this is that loops containing a break lose their supercoiling and become free to extend toward the anode. This is followed by visual analysis with staining of DNA and calculating fluorescence to determine the extent of DNA damage. This can be performed by manual scoring or automatically by imaging software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=A.

==Procedure==

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}

===Encapsulation===
A sample of cells, either derived from an ''[[in vitro]]'' [[cell culture]] or from an ''[[in vivo]]'' test subject is dispersed into individual cells and suspended in molten low-melting-point [[agarose]] at 37&amp;nbsp;°C. This mono-suspension is cast on a [[microscope slide]]. A glass [[cover slip]] is held at an angle and the mono-suspension applied to the point of contact between the coverslip and the slide. As the coverslip is lowered onto the slide the molten agarose spreads to form a thin layer. The agarose is gelled at 4&amp;nbsp;°C and the coverslip removed.

The agarose forms a matrix of [[carbohydrate]] fibres that encapsulate the cells, anchoring them in place. The agarose is considered to be [[osmotic]]-neutral, therefore [[solution]]s can penetrate the gel and affect the cells without cells shifting position.

In an ''in vitro'' study the cells would be exposed to a test agent – typically [[UV light]], [[ionising radiation]], or a [[genotoxic]] chemical – to induce DNA damage in the encapsulated cells. For [[calibration]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] is usually used to provide a standardized level of DNA damage.

===Lysis===
The slides are then immersed in a solution that cause the cells to [[lysis|lyse]]. The lysis solution often used in the comet assay consists of a highly concentrated aqueous [[salt]] (often, common [[table salt]] can be used) and a [[detergent]] (such as [[Triton X-100]] or [[Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate|sarcosinate]]). The [[pH]] of the lysis solution can be adjusted (usually between neutral and [[alkaline]] pH) depending upon the type of damage the researcher is investigating.

The aqueous salt disrupts [[protein]]s and their bonding patterns within the cell as well as disrupting the [[RNA]] content of the cell. The detergent dissolves the [[cellular membrane]]s. Through the action of the lysis solution the cells are destroyed. All proteins, RNA, membranes and [[cytoplasm]]ic and [[nucleoplasm]]ic constituents are disrupted and diffuse into the agarose matrix. Only the [[DNA]] of the cell remains, and unravels to fill the cavity in the agarose that the whole cell formerly filled. This structure is called nucleoid (a general term for a structure in which DNA is concentrated).

===Electrophoresis===
After lysis of the cells (typically 1 to 2 hours at 4&amp;nbsp;°C) the slides are washed in [[distilled water]] to remove all salts and immersed in a second solution – an [[electrophoresis]] solution. Again this solution can have its pH adjusted depending upon the type of damage that is being investigated.

The slides are left for ~20 minutes in the electrophoresis solution prior to an [[electric field]] being applied. In alkaline conditions the [[DNA double helix]] is [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]d and the nucleoid becomes single stranded.

An electric field is applied (typically 1 [[volt|V]]/[[centimeter|cm]]) for ~20 minutes. The slides are then neutralised to pH 7, stained with a [[Staining#Basic biological stains|DNA-specific fluorescent stain]] and analysed using a [[microscope]] with an attached CCD ([[charge-coupled device]] – essentially a [[digital camera]]) that is connected to a computer with [[image analysis]] software.

==Background==

The concept underlying the SCGE assay is that undamaged DNA retains a highly organized association with matrix proteins in the nucleus. When damaged, this organization is disrupted. The individual strands of DNA lose their compact structure and relax, expanding out of the cavity into the agarose. When the electric field is applied the DNA, which has an overall negative charge, is drawn towards the positively charged anode. Undamaged DNA strands are too large and do not leave the cavity, whereas the smaller the fragments, the farther they are free to move in a given period of time. Therefore, the amount of DNA that leaves the cavity is a measure of the amount of DNA damage in the cell.

The image analysis measures the overall intensity of the fluorescence for the whole nucleoid and the fluorescence of the migrated DNA and compares the two signals. The stronger the signal from the migrated DNA the more damage there is present. The overall structure resembles a [[comet]] (hence "comet assay") with a circular head corresponding to the undamaged DNA that remains in the cavity and a tail of damaged DNA. The brighter and longer the tail, the higher the level of damage.

The comet assay is a versatile technique for detecting damage and with adjustments to the protocol can be used to quantify the presence of a wide variety of DNA altering lesions (damage). The damage usually detected are single strand breaks and double strand breaks. It is sometimes stated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pu|first=Xinzhu|last2=Wang|first2=Zemin|last3=Klaunig|first3=James E.|date=2015-08-06|title=Alkaline Comet Assay for Assessing DNA Damage in Individual Cells|journal=Current Protocols in Toxicology|volume=65|pages=3.12.1–11|doi=10.1002/0471140856.tx0312s65|issn=1934-9262|pmid=26250399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=Peter|date=April 2006|title=The alkaline comet assay: towards validation in biomonitoring of DNA damaging exposures|journal=Basic &amp; Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|volume=98|issue=4|pages=336–345|doi=10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_167.x|issn=1742-7835|pmid=16623855}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[alkaline]] conditions and complete denaturating of the DNA is necessary to detect single strand breaks.

The comet assay is an extremely sensitive DNA damage assay. This sensitivity needs to be handled carefully as it is also vulnerable to physical changes which can affect the reproducibility of results. Essentially, anything that can cause DNA damage or denaturation except the factor(s) being researched is to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Theoretical and practical limitations to the assay are discussed e.g. in Klaude ''et al.'' (1996) and Collins ''et al.'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form of the assay is the alkaline version although there is as yet no definitive alkaline assay protocol. Due to its simple and inexpensive setup, it can be used in conditions where more complex assays are not available.

==Applications==
These include genotoxicity testing, human biomonitoring and molecular epidemiology, ecogenotoxicology, as well as fundamental research in DNA damage and repair.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/csmm/.../SCG%20Electrophoresis.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sperm DNA fragmentation===
A Comet assay can determine the degree of [[DNA fragmentation]] in sperm cells. The degree of DNA fragmentation has been associated with outcomes of [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon L, Brunborg G, Stevenson M, Lutton D, McManus J, Lewis SE |title=Clinical significance of sperm DNA damage in assisted reproduction outcome |journal=Hum Reprod |volume= 25|issue= 7|pages= 1594–1608|date=May 2010 |pmid=20447937 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deq103 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagrajappa |first1= |last2=Ganguly |first2=Anutosh |last3=Goswami |first3=Usha |title=DNA damage in male gonad cells of Green mussel (Perna viridis) upon exposure to tobacco products. |journal=Ecotoxicology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=365–369 |year=2006 |pmid=16673160 |doi=10.1007/s10646-006-0077-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content and language integrated learning''' ('''CLIL''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/clil British Council BBC Teaching English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson &amp; McKinley|title=Integration of content and language learning|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/integration_of_content_and_langauge_tesol_encyclopedia_author_version.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach for learning content through an additional language (foreign or second), thus teaching both the subject and the language. 

==CLIL origin==
The term '''CLIL''' was created in 1994 by  [http://clil-cd.ecml.at/Team/Teammember4/tabid/941/language/en-GB/Default.aspx David Marsh] as a methodology similar to but distinct from [[language immersion]] and [[content-based instruction]]. The idea of its proponents was to create an "umbrella term" which encompasses different forms of using language as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onestopenglish.com/clil/what-is-clil/ | title=What is CLIL? | work=Onestopenglish | accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has been applied in a business context in many countries and widely accepted as an effective approach. In Italy for example, it is being used as an accelerated method to teach management concepts in English to business people. Among CLIL's proponents and practitioners there is Dr Maurizio Morselli, a Human Resources professional and Executive Coach, who believes that "this hybrid immersion approach produces a lot more immediate results and it appeals to self-motivated adult audiences who possess a basic knowledge and understanding of the target language".

==CLIL and language immersion==
CLIL is fundamentally based on methodological principles established by research on [[language immersion]]. This kind of approach has been identified as very important by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2003:0449:FIN:EN:PDF Commission Of The European Communities Promoting Language Learning and Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004 – 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; because: "It can provide effective opportunities for pupils to use their new language skills now, rather than learn them now for use later. It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography, managerial skills/concepts or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners. 

The European Commission has therefore decided to promote the training of teachers to "...enhancing the language competences in general, in order to promote the teaching of non-linguistic subjects in foreign languages".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:320:0001:0003:EN:PDF Journal of the European Union Council Resolution of 21 November 2008 on a European strategy for multilingualism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An educational project called [http://e-clil.uws.ac.uk/ ECLIL] was also supported from the European Union within the [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/index_en.php Lifelong Learning Programme EACEA Agency], to develop interactive resources for European schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLIL objectives==
CLIL objectives are varied, but among the most relevant ones the following can be pointed out (Coyle et al., 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, D., Hood, P. &amp; Marsh, D. (2010). CLIL. Cambridge: C.U.P.&lt;/ref&gt;: To improve the educational system. To establish the necessary conditions that will allow students to achieve the appropriate level of academic performance in CLIL subjects. To improve students’ proficiency in both their mother tongue and the target language, attaching the same importance to each. To develop the intercultural understanding. To develop social and thinking skills.

CLIL advocates claim that this educational approach (Lorenzo et al., 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo, F., Trujillo, F. &amp; Vez, M. (2011). Educación bilingüe. Integración de contenidos y segundas lenguas. Madrid: Síntesis.&lt;/ref&gt;: Improves L1 and L2 development. Prepares students for the globalized world. Increases students’ motivation to learn foreign languages. Promotes the learning of a more extensive and varied vocabulary. Enhances students’ confidence in the target language. Improves language competence in the target language, CLIL being more beneficial that traditional foreign language teaching courses. Helps develop intercultural competence.

==CLIL in English as an international language==
The integration of content and language learning in [[international English|English as an international language]] (EIL) is found in approaches to [[bilingual education]].&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches include [[language immersion|immersion]], [[content-based instruction]] (CBI), content-based language teaching (CBLT), and the movement towards [[English-medium education|English medium instruction]] (EMI). All of these approaches raise a number of questions that a view of English as an international language has for content-integrated approaches (Thompson &amp; McKinley, 2018).&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiplicity of terms===
The multiplicity of terms used to refer to instructional approaches for the integration of content and language learning (immersion, CBI, CBLT, CLIL, EMI) can be a source of confusion in EIL studies, although they all commonly share the purpose of additive bilingualism via a dual focus on content and language learning. Debate continues about the extent to which immersion, CBLT, CBI, and CLIL are different, similar, or the same. Some argue that CLIL represents an appropriate umbrella term that can be used to house various approaches towards content integration (e.g., immersion is a type of CLIL), where terms can be used interchangeably (e.g., CLIL and CBI are the same concept with a different name) (Cenoz et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cenoz, Gennessee &amp; Gorter|title=Critical analysis of CLIL: Taking stock and looking forward.|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=3|pages=243-262}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that CLIL and CBI represent very different concepts, where CLIL represents the intersection between content and language from the content perspective (i.e., CLIL happens in content classes), while CBI is an attempt at responding to the content needs of learners in language classes (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton-Puffer, Llinares, Lorenzo &amp; Nikula|title=“You can stand under my umbrella”: Immersion, clil and bilingual education. A response to Cenoz, Genesee &amp; Gorter (2013).|journal=Applied Linguistics|date=2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=213-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similarities (and variability) between approaches lead to circular arguments about whether the key features of one approach are also shared by others (e.g., immersion and CLIL), and therefore they are indistinguishable. In some ways, this is an inevitable result of terms being used outside of academia, by educators applying ideas from one context to another,&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the lines of demarcation become more unclear as approaches are transported to different countries and contextualized to meet different learning situations.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In EIL studies, different terms have been associated with different regions, such as CLIL, which is associated with Europe, and was “purposefully coined” by European educators and researchers attempting to influence language policy and ideology (Dalton-Puffer et al., 2014:214).&lt;ref name="Dalton-Puffer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CLIL represented a deliberate attempt to develop a European model for additive bilingual education.&lt;ref name="Cenoz"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[policy-maker|policy makers]], educators, and researchers from international contexts have started to apply and develop CLIL approaches in distinctly non-European situations, and the term is now widely used within the wider international foreign language learning community.&lt;ref name="TESOL"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Daisy1web.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Osteospermum]]'' 'Pink Whirls' &lt;br&gt; A cultivar selected for its intriguing and colourful flowers&lt;/center&gt;]]

The term '''''cultivar'''''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Cultivar''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|t|ᵻ|ˌ|v|ɑːr|,_|-|ˌ|v|ɛər}}) has two denominations as explained in ''[[#Formal definition|Formal definition]]''. When referring to a [[taxon]], the word does not apply to an individual plant but to all plants that share the unique characters that define the cultivar.&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly refers to an assemblage of plants selected for desirable characters that are maintained during [[Plant propagation|propagation]]. More generally, ''cultivar'' refers to the most basic classification category of cultivated plants in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (ICNCP). Most cultivars arose in cultivation, but a few are special selections from the wild.

Popular ornamental [[List of garden plants|garden plants]] like [[rose]]s, [[camellia]]s, [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]], [[rhododendron]]s, and [[azalea]]s are cultivars produced by [[Selective breeding|careful breeding and selection]] for floral colour and form. Similarly, the world's agricultural [[food crop]]s are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characters such as improved yield, flavour, and resistance to disease, and very few wild plants are now used as food sources. Trees used in [[forestry]] are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of [[timber]].

Cultivars form a major part of [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]]'s broader group, the [[cultigen]],&lt;ref name="Bailey 1923 113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1923|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2007|p=938}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cultivar is not the same as a [[Variety (botany)|botanical variety]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1953|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a taxonomic rank below [[subspecies]], and there are differences in the rules for creating and using the names of botanical varieties and cultivars.  In recent times, the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory [[patents]] for plants and recognition of [[plant breeders' rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802200032/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/hort/courses/HORT217/Nomenclature/description.htm See]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] (UPOV – {{Lang-fr|Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions végétales}}) offers legal protection of plant cultivars to persons or organisations that introduce new cultivars to commerce. UPOV requires that a cultivar be "distinct, uniform", and "stable". To be "distinct", it must have characters that easily distinguish it from any other known cultivar. To be "uniform" and "stable", the cultivar must retain these characters in repeated propagation.

The naming of cultivars is an important aspect of [[cultivated plant taxonomy]], and the correct naming of a cultivar is prescribed by the Rules and Recommendations of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP, commonly denominated the ''Cultivated Plant Code''). A cultivar is given a cultivar name, which consists of the scientific [[Latin]] botanical name followed by a cultivar [[Binomial nomenclature|epithet]]. The cultivar epithet is usually in a [[vernacular]] language. For example, the full cultivar name of the [[King Edward potato]] is ''Solanum tuberosum'' 'King Edward'. 'King Edward' is the cultivar epithet, which, according to the Rules of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'', is bounded by single quotation marks.&lt;ref name="Brickell 2009 19"&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Article 14.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

[[Image:Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858-1954.jpg|thumb|right|210px|&lt;center&gt;[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858–1954) coined the words ''cultigen'' in 1918 and ''cultivar'' in 1923.&lt;/center&gt;]]{{Main|Cultivated plant taxonomy}}

The word ''cultivar'' originated from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that arose in cultivation, presently denominated ''cultigens''. This distinction dates to the Greek philosopher [[Theophrastus]] (370–285&amp;nbsp;BC), the "Father of Botany", who was keenly aware of this difference. Botanical historian Alan Morton noted that [[Theophrastus]] in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'' (''Enquiry into Plants'') "had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced ([[phenotype|phenotypic]]) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution" (''Historia Plantarum'', Book 3, 2, 2 and ''Causa Plantarum'', Book 1, 9, 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] uses as its starting point for modern [[botanical nomenclature]] the [[Latin]] names in [[Linnaeus]]' (1707–1778) ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (tenth edition) and ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' (fifth edition). In ''Species Plantarum'', Linnaeus enumerated all plants known to him, either directly or from his extensive reading. He recognised the rank of [[Variety (botany)|varietas]] (botanical "variety", a rank below that of [[species]] and [[subspecies]]) and he indicated these varieties with letters of the [[Greek alphabet]], such as α, β, and λ, before the varietal name, rather than using the abbreviation "var." as is the present convention. Most of the varieties that Linnaeus enumerated were of "garden" origin rather than being wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with variations that had been cultivated increased. In the nineteenth century many "garden-derived" plants were given horticultural names, sometimes in [[Latin]] and sometimes in a vernacular language. From ''circa'' the 1900s, cultivated plants in [[Europe]] were recognised in the Scandinavian, Germanic, and Slavic literature as ''stamm'' or ''sorte'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these words could not be used internationally because, by international agreement, any new denominations had to be in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century an improved international nomenclature was proposed for cultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1955|pp=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] of [[Cornell University]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]] created the word ''cultivar'' in 1923 when he wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The cultigen is a species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication – the plant is cultigenous. I now propose another name, cultivar, for a botanical variety, or for a race subordinate to species, that has originated under cultivation; it is not necessarily, however, referable to a recognized botanical species. It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1923 113"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that essay, Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, but it was obvious to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species, and that realization appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new category of ''cultivar''.

Bailey created the word ''cultivar'', which is generally assumed to be a [[portmanteau]] of '''''culti'''vated'' and '''''var'''iety''. Bailey never explicitly stated the [[etymology]] of ''cultivar'', and it has been suggested that it is instead a contraction of '''''culti'''gen'' and '''''var'''iety'', which seems correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trehane|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] ''cultivar'' was promoted as "euphonious" and "free from ambiguity".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This ignored its prior use as a transitive verb in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] denoting "to farm, to cultivate, to grow, or to practice" ([http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/cultivar Online Spanish dictionary]), and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] denoting ''to cultivate, to husband, to farm, to plant, to polish, to reclaim, to improve'' ([http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp%3bjsessionid=bc304a778686293e1e2f?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&amp;direction=2&amp;status=translate&amp;lang1=23&amp;lang2=pt&amp;source=cultivar Ectaco online Portuguese dictionary]).&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Cultivated Plant Code'' of 1953 subsequently commended its use, and by 1960 it had achieved common international acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawrence|1960|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultigens ===
{{Main|Cultigen}}

[[File:Triticum aestivum, Gewone tarwe.jpg|thumb|210px|Bread wheat, ''[[Triticum aestivum]]'', is considered a cultigen, and is a distinct species from other [[Triticum|wheats]] according to the [[biological species concept]]. Many different cultivars have been created within this cultigen. Many other cultigens are not considered to be distinct species, and can be denominated otherwise.]]

The words ''[[cultigen]]'' and ''cultivar'' may be confused with each other. A ''[[cultigen]]'' is any plant that is deliberately selected for or altered in cultivation, as opposed to an ''[[indigen]]''; the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' states that cultigens are "maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation".&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 2.3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultigen]]s can have names at any of many taxonomic ranks, including those of [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]], [[species]], [[cultivar group]], [[variety (botany)|variety]], [[forma (botany)|form]], and cultivar; and they may be plants that have been altered in cultivation, including by [[Genetically modified organism|genetic modification]], but have not been formally denominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cultigen]] or a component of a cultigen can be accepted as a cultivar if it is recognisable and has stable characters. Therefore, all cultivars are [[cultigen]]s, because they originate in cultivation, but not all cultigens are cultivars, because some cultigens have not been formally distinguished and denominated as cultivars.

== Formal definition ==
{{Main|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}}
The ''Cultivated Plant Code'' notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses: first, as a "classification category" the cultivar is defined in Article 2 of the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'' (2009, 8th edition) as follows: ''The basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this Code is the cultivar.''&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 2.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other classification categories for cultigens, the [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]]&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 4 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cultivar group|group]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Code'' then defines a ''cultivar'' as a "taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar". This is the sense of ''cultivar'' that is most generally understood and which is used as a general definition.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A cultivar is an assemblage of plants that (a)&amp;nbsp;has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters, (b)&amp;nbsp;is distinct, uniform and stable in those characters, and (c)&amp;nbsp;when propagated by appropriate means, retains those characters.''&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Art. 2.2 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Different kinds ==
[[Image:Airport orchid.JPG|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;A cultivar of the orchid genus ''[[Oncidium]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of [[horticulture]], [[agricultural science|agriculture]], and [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code. Preamble &amp; Principles {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of a particular cultivar are not necessarily genetically identical. The ''Cultivated Plant Code'' emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars, even if they have the same genome, while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar. The production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild (whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed).&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Article 2.20 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultivars generally occur as [[Ornamental plant|ornamentals]] and food crops: ''[[Malus]]'' '[[Granny Smith]]' and ''Malus'' '[[Red Delicious]]' are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or [[grafting]], ''[[Lactuca]]'' 'Red Sails' and ''Lactuca'' 'Great Lakes' are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds. Named cultivars of ''[[Hosta]]'' and ''[[Hemerocallis]]'' plants are cultivars produced by [[micropropagation]] or division.

=== Clones ===
{{Main|Clone (botany)}}
[[Image:Leucospermum cultivar Edit.jpg|right|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Leucospermum]]'' 'Scarlet Ribbon'&lt;br&gt;A cross performed in Tasmania between ''[[Leucospermum glabrum|L.&amp;nbsp;glabrum]]'' and ''[[Leucospermum tottum|L.&amp;nbsp;tottum]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
Cultivars that are produced asexually are genetically identical and known as [[Cloning|clones]]; this includes plants propagated by [[division (horticulture)|division]], [[layering]], [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]], [[grafting|grafts]], and [[budding]]. The propagating material may be taken from a particular part of the plant, such as a lateral branch, or from a particular phase of the life cycle, such as a juvenile leaf, or from aberrant growth as occurs with [[witch's broom]]. Plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation. Plants of the same [[chimera (plant)|chimera]] (which have mutant tissues close to normal tissue) or graft-chimeras (which have vegetative tissue from different kinds of plants and which originate by grafting) may also constitute a cultivar.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.5–2.11 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed-produced ===
Some cultivars "come true from seed", retaining their distinguishing characteristics when grown from seed. Such plants are termed a "variety", "selection" or "strain" but these are ambiguous and confusing words that are best avoided. In general, asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants, and should not be labelled with, or sold under, the parent cultivar's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publications/plantsman/0605/opinion.asp Courses / RHS Gardening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226124519/http://www.rhs.org.uk/learning/publications/plantsman/0605/opinion.asp |date=2005-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seed-raised cultivars may be produced by uncontrolled pollination when characteristics that are distinct, uniform and stable are passed from parents to progeny. Some are produced as "lines" that are produced by repeated self-fertilization or inbreeding or "multilines" that are made up of several closely related lines. Sometimes they are [[F1&amp;nbsp;hybrid]]s which are the result of a deliberate repeatable single cross between two pure lines. A few F2 hybrid seed cultivars also exist, such as ''Achillea'' 'Summer Berries'.

Some cultivars are [[Agamospermy|agamospermous]] plants, which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.17–2.18 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.12–2.16  {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetically modified ===
{{Main|Genetic engineering}}
Genetically modified plants with characteristics resulting from the deliberate implantation of genetic material from a different [[germplasm]] may form a cultivar. However, the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] notes, "In practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified. These lines or multilines often remain in a constant state of development which makes the naming of such an assemblage as a cultivar a futile exercise." &lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2.19 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, retired transgenic varieties such as the [[Fish tomato]], which are no longer being developed, do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name.

Cultivars may be selected because of a change in the [[ploidy]] level of a plant which may produce more desirable characteristics.

== Cultivar names ==
[[Image:Viola x hybrida 'Clear Crystals Apricot', SC, Vic., 15.9.2007.jpg|right|210px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''Viola'' 'Clear Crystals Apricot'&lt;br&gt;The specific epithet may be omitted from a cultivar name&lt;/center&gt;]]
Every unique cultivar has a unique name within its denomination class (which is almost always the genus). Names of cultivars are regulated by the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', and may be registered with an [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] (ICRA). There are sometimes separate registration authorities for different plant types such as roses and camellias. In addition, cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' as "trade designations" (see below).

=== Presenting in text ===
A ''cultivar name'' consists of a [[botanical name]] (of a genus, [[species]], infraspecific [[taxon]], interspecific [[Hybrid animal|hybrid]] or intergeneric hybrid) followed by a cultivar [[epithet]]. The cultivar epithet is enclosed by single quotes;&lt;ref name="Brickell 2009 19"/&gt; it should not be italicized if the botanical name is italicized;&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Recommendation 8A.1 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each of the words within the epithet is [[capitalization|capitalized]] (with some permitted exceptions such as conjunctions).&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Article 21.3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous. Cultivar epithets published before 1 January 1959 were often given a [[Latin]] form and can be readily confused with the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithets]] in botanical names; after that date, newly coined cultivar epithets must be in a modern vernacular language to distinguish them from botanical epithets.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 14 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Examples of correct text presentation:
:: ''[[Cryptomeria japonica]]'' 'Elegans'
:: ''[[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana]]'' 'Aureomarginata' (pre-1959 name, [[Latin]] in form)
:: ''Chamaecyparis lawsoniana'' 'Golden Wonder' (post-1959 name, [[English language]])
:: ''[[Pinus densiflora]]'' 'Akebono' (post-1959 name, [[Japanese language]])
:: Apple 'Sundown'

: Some '''incorrect''' text presentation examples:
:: ''Cryptomeria japonica'' "Elegans" (double quotes are unacceptable)
:: ''Berberis thunbergii'' cv. 'Crimson Pygmy' (this once-common usage is now unacceptable, as it is no longer correct to use "cv." in this context; ''Berberis thunbergii'' 'Crimson Pygmy' is correct)
:: ''Rosa'' cv. 'Peace' (this is now incorrect for two reasons: firstly, the use of "cv."; secondly, "Peace" is a trade designation or "selling name" for the cultivar ''R.'' 'Madame A. Meilland' and should therefore be printed in a different typeface from the rest of the name, without quote marks, for example: ''Rosa''&lt;tt&gt; Peace&lt;/tt&gt;.)

== Group names ==
{{Main|Cultivar group}}
Where several very similar cultivars exist they can be associated into a ''Group'' (formerly ''Cultivar-group''). As Group names are used with cultivar names it is necessary to understand their way of presentation. Group names are presented in normal type and the first letter of each word capitalised as for cultivars, but they are not placed in single quotes. When used in a name, the first letter of the word "Group" is itself capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presenting in text ===
:: ''Brassica oleracea'' Capitata Group (the group of cultivars including all typical [[cabbage]]s)
:: ''Brassica oleracea'' Botrytis Group (the group of cultivars including all typical [[cauliflower]]s)
:: ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' Groupe Hortensia (in French) = ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' Hortensia Group (in English)
: Where cited with a cultivar name the group should be enclosed in parentheses, as follows:
:: ''Hydrangea macrophylla'' (Hortensia Group) 'Ayesha' &lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 15 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal protection of cultivars and their names ==
{{Intellectual property}}
{{further|Plant breeders' rights|Trademark}}
Since the 1990s there has been an increasing use of legal protection for newly produced cultivars. [[Plant breeding|Plant breeders]] expect legal protection for the cultivars they produce. According to proponents of such protections, if other growers can immediately propagate and sell these cultivars as soon as they come on the market, the breeder's benefit is largely lost.&lt;ref&gt;P. Gepts (2004) ''Who Owns Biodiversity, and How Should the Owners Be Compensated?'' Plant Physiology 134, pp. 1295–1307&lt;/ref&gt;
Legal protection for cultivars is obtained through the use of Plant breeders’ rights and plant Patents but the specific legislation and procedures needed to take advantage of this protection vary from country to country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bspb.co.uk/BSPB%20Handbook.pdf BSPB ''Plant breeding – The business and science of crop improvement''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911091226/http://www.bspb.co.uk/BSPB%20Handbook.pdf |date=2011-09-11 }} British Society of Plant Breeders booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial use of legal protection for cultivars ===
The use of legal protection for cultivars can be controversial, particularly for food crops that are staples in developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=647863 Adi, A.B.C., ''Intellectual Property Rights in Biotechnology and the Fate of Poor Farmers' Agriculture.''  Social Science Research Network]&lt;/ref&gt; or for plants selected from the wild and propagated for sale without any additional breeding work; some people consider this practice [[Ethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callygardens.co.uk/pbr_article.html 'Who owns nature?'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911145947/http://www.callygardens.co.uk/pbr_article.html |date=2011-09-11 }} (article by nurseryman and plant hunter Michael Wickenden, published in ''[[The Plantsman (magazine)|The Plantsman]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade designations and selling names ===
{{anchor|Trade designations|reason=Old section name, with many links to it.}}
The formal scientific name of a cultivar, like ''Solanum tuberosum'' ‘King Edward’, is a way of uniquely designating a particular kind of plant. This scientific name is in the public domain and cannot be legally protected. Plant retailers wish to maximize their share of the market and one way of doing this is to replace the cumbersome Latin scientific names on plant labels in retail outlets with appealing '''marketing names''' that are easy to use, pronounce, and remember. Marketing names lie outside the scope of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' which refers to them as "'''trade designations'''". If a retailer or wholesaler has the sole legal rights to a marketing name then that may offer a sales advantage. Plants protected by [[plant breeders' rights]] (PBR) may have a "true" cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain – and a "commercial synonym" – an additional marketing name that is legally protected.  An example would be ''Rosa'' {{tdes|Fascination}} = 'Poulmax', in which ''Rosa'' is the genus, {{tdes|Fascination}} is the trade designation, and ‘Poulmax’ is scientific cultivar name.

Because a name that is attractive in one language may have less appeal in another country, a plant may be given different '''selling names''' from country to country. Quoting the original cultivar name allows the correct identification of cultivars around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|pages=76–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body coordinating plant breeders' rights is the [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants]] ({{lang|fr|Union internationale pour la protection des obtentions végétales}}, UPOV) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by PBR in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Cultivar Registration Authorities ==
{{Main|International Cultivar Registration Authority}}
[[Image:Dahlia - "Akita" cultivar.pjg.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;''[[Dahlia]]'' 'Akita' &lt;br&gt; A cultivar selected for flower form and colour&lt;/center&gt;]]
An ''International Cultivar Registration Authority'' (ICRA) is a voluntary, non-statutory organization appointed by the ''Commission for Nomenclature and Cultivar Registration'' of the International Society of Horticultural Science. ICRAs are generally formed by societies and institutions specializing in particular plant genera such as ''Dahlia'' or ''Rhododendron'' and are currently located in Europe, North America, China, India, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|pp=62, 67–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ICRA produces an annual report and its reappointment is considered every four years. The main task is to maintain a register of the names within the group of interest and where possible this is published and placed in the public domain. One major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and Group epithets within a genus, as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. In this way, over the last 50 years or so, ICRAs have contributed to the stability of cultivated plant nomenclature. In recent times many ICRAs have also recorded trade designations and trademarks used in labelling plant material, to avoid confusion with established names.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://www.ishs.org/sci/icralist/icralist.htm International Cultivar Registration Authorities]&lt;/ref&gt;

New names and other relevant data are collected by and submitted to the ICRA and in most cases there is no cost. The ICRA then checks each new epithet to ensure that it has not been used before and that it conforms with the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. Each ICRA also ensures that new names are formally established (i.e. published in hard copy, with a description in a dated publication). They record details about the plant, such as parentage, the names of those concerned with its development and introduction, and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters. ICRAs are not responsible for assessing the distinctiveness of the plant in question.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Most ICRAs can be contacted electronically and many maintain web sites: for an up-to-date listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Multimedia instructional design principles==

Beginning with [[Cognitive load|cognitive load theory]] as their motivating scientific premise, researchers such as [[Richard E. Mayer]], [[John Sweller]], and Roxana Moreno established within the scientific literature a set of multimedia instructional design principles that promote effective learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Moreno, R., "Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning." Educational psychologist, 38(1), 43-52, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R, "Interactive multimodal learning environments." Educational Psychology Review, 19(3), 309-326, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. C., Nguyen, F., &amp; Sweller, J., "Efficiency in learning: Evidence-based guidelines to manage cognitive load." John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these principles have been "field tested" in everyday learning settings and found to be effective there as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harskamp, E. G., Mayer, R. E., &amp; Suhre, C., "Does the modality principle for multimedia learning apply to science classrooms?" Learning and Instruction, 17(5), 465-477, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C., &amp; Yang, F. Y., "Exploring the cognitive loads of high-school students as they learn concepts in web-based environments," Computers &amp; Education, 55(2), 673-680, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issa, N., Mayer, R. E., Schuller, M., Wang, E., Shapiro, M. B., &amp; DaRosa, D. A., "Teaching for understanding in medical classrooms using multimedia design principles," Medical education, 47(4), 388-396, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of this body of research has been performed using university students given relatively short lessons on technical concepts with which they held low prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David Roberts has tested the method with students in nine social science disciplines including sociology, politics and business studies. His longitudinal research programme over 3 years established a clear improvement in levels of student engagement and in the development of active learning principles among students exposed to a combination of images and text, over students exposed only to text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inspiringsocsci.pressbooks.com/chapter/life-after-death-by-powerpoint/|title=Life after Death by PowerPoint {{!}} Inspire – teaching and learning in the Social Sciences|website=inspiringsocsci.pressbooks.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other studies have shown these principles to be effective with learners of other ages and with non-technical learning content.&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes," Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerven, P. W., Paas, F., Merriënboer, J. J., Hendriks, M., &amp; Schmidt, H. G., "The efficiency of multimedia learning into old age," British Journal of Educational Psychology, 73(4), 489-505, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research using learners who have greater prior knowledge in the lesson material sometimes finds results that contradict these design principles. This has led some researchers to put forward the "expertise effect" as an instructional design principle unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A. E., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merriënboer, J. J. G., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animations," Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples," Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, P., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Sweller, J. "Interactions between the isolated–interactive elements effect and levels of learner expertise: Experimental evidence from an accountancy class," Instructional Science, 38(3), 277-287, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction," Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying theoretical premise, cognitive load theory, describes the amount of mental effort that is related to performing a task as falling into one of three categories: germane, intrinsic, and extraneous.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J (June 1988). "Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning". Cognitive Science 12 (2): 257–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Germane cognitive load is the mental effort required to process the task's information, make sense of it, and access and/or store it in long-term memory (for example, seeing a math problem, identifying the values and operations involved, and understanding that your task is to solve the math problem). Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort required to perform the task itself (for example, actually solving the math problem). Extraneous cognitive load is the mental effort imposed by the way that the task is delivered, which may or may not be efficient (for example, finding the math problem you are supposed to solve on a page that also contains advertisements for books about math).

The multimedia instructional design principles identified by Mayer, Sweller, Moreno, and their colleagues are largely focused on minimizing extraneous cognitive load and managing intrinsic and germane loads at levels that are appropriate for the learner. Examples of these principles in practice include 
* Reducing extraneous load by eliminating visual and auditory effects and elements that are not central to the lesson, such as [[seductive details]] (the coherence principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Bove, W., Bryman, A., Mars, R., &amp; Tapangco, L., "When less is more: Meaningful learning from visual and verbal summaries of science textbook lessons." Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 64–73, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp, S.F., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning." Journal of Educational Psychology, 90, 414–434, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing germane load by delivering verbal information through audio presentation (narration) while delivering relevant visual information through static images or animations (the modality principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes." Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., &amp; Moreno, R., "A split-attention effect in multimedia learning: Evidence for dual coding hypothesis." Journal of Educational Psychology, 83, 484–490, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling intrinsic load by breaking the lesson into smaller segments and giving learners control over the pace at which they move forward through the lesson material (the segmenting principle).&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"&gt;Moreno, R., "Optimizing learning from animations by minimizing cognitive load: Cognitive and affective consequences of signaling and segmentation methods." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 21, 765–781, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., van Gog, T., Wouters, P., &amp; van Merriënboer, J. J., "Explaining the segmentation effect in learning from animations: The role of pausing and temporal cueing." Computers &amp; Education, 59(2), 274-280, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florax, M., &amp; Ploetzner, R., "What contributes to the split-attention effect? Role of text segmentation, picture labeling, and spatial proximity." Learning and Instruction, 20, 216–224, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive load theory (and by extension many of the multimedia instructional design principles) is based in part on a model of [[working memory]] by [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] who proposed that working memory has two largely independent, limited capacity sub-components that tend to work in parallel – one visual and one verbal/acoustic.&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; This gave rise to [[dual-coding theory]], first proposed by [[Allan Paivio]] and later applied to multimedia learning by [[Richard E. Mayer|Richard Mayer]]. According to Mayer,&lt;ref name=Mayer2001 /&gt; separate channels of working memory process auditory and visual information during any lesson. Consequently, a learner can use more cognitive processing capacities to study materials that combine auditory verbal information with visual graphical information than to process materials that combine printed (visual) text with visual graphical information. In other words, the multi-modal materials reduce the cognitive load imposed on working memory.

In a series of studies, Mayer and his colleagues tested Paivio's [[dual-coding theory]], with multimedia lesson materials. They repeatedly found that students given multimedia with animation and narration consistently did better on transfer questions than those who learn from animation and text-based materials. That is, they were significantly better when it came to applying what they had learned after receiving multimedia rather than mono-media (visual only) instruction. These results were then later confirmed by other groups of researchers.

The initial studies of multimedia learning were limited to logical scientific processes that centered on cause-and-effect systems like automobile braking systems, how a bicycle pump works or cloud formation. However, subsequent investigations found that the [[modality effect]] extended to other areas of learning.

===Empirically established principles===
* '''Multimedia principle:''' Deeper learning is observed when words and relevant graphics are both presented than when words are presented alone (also called the multimedia effect).&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Ruth C.|last2=Mayer|first2=Richard E.|title=E-learning and the science of instruction: Proven guidelines for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the three most common elements in multimedia presentations are relevant graphics, audio narration, and explanatory text. Combining any two of these three elements works better than using just one or all three.
* '''Modality principle:'''  native speakers of the narration language, or when only printed words appear on the screen.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Generally speaking, audio narration leads to better learning than the same words presented as text on the screen. This is especially true for walking someone through graphics on the screen, and when the material to be learned is complex or the terminology being used is already understood by the student (otherwise see "pre-training"). One exception to this is when the learner will be using the information as a reference and will need to look back to it again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic principles for online and multimedia learning|url=http://www.edgurus.com/the-basics.html|website=www.edgurus.com|publisher=EdGurus.com|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coherence principle:''' Avoid using unnecessary content (irrelevant video, graphics, music, stories, narration, etc.) in order to minimize cognitive load imposed on memory during learning by irrelevant and possibly distracting content.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Basically, the less learners know about the lesson content, the easier it is for them to get distracted by anything shown that is not directly relevant to the lesson. For learners with greater prior knowledge, however, some motivational imagery may increase their interest and learning effectiveness just a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Park, B., Moreno, R., Seufert, T., &amp; Brü., "Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 5-10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A., "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contiguity principle:''' Keep related pieces of information together. Deeper learning occurs when relevant text (for example, a label) is placed close to graphics or when spoken words and graphics are presented at the same time, or when feedback is presented next to the answer given by the learner.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;
* '''Segmenting principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when content is broken into small chunks.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Break down long lessons into several shorter lessons.  Break down long text passages into multiple shorter ones.
* '''Signalling principle:''' The use of visual, auditory, or temporal cues to draw attention to critical elements of the lesson. Common techniques include arrows, circles, highlighting or bolding text, and pausing or vocal emphasis in narration.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks, S. M., Cheon, J., Inan, F., Ari, F., &amp; Flores, R. "Modality and cueing in multimedia learning: Examining cognitive and perceptual explanations for the modality effect." Computers in Human Behavior, 28(3), 1063-1071, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending lesson segments after the critical information has been given may also serve as a signalling cue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, M., Antonenko, P. D., Greenwood, C. M., &amp; Wheeler, D. "Effects of segmenting, signalling, and weeding on learning from educational video." Learning, Media and Technology, 37(3), 220-235, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Learner control principle: ''' Deeper learning occurs when learners can control the rate at which they move forward through segmented content.&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasler, B. S., Kersten, B., &amp; Sweller, J., "Learner control, cognitive load and instructional animation." Applied cognitive psychology, 21(6), 713-729, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savoji|first1=A.P.|last2=Hassanabadi|first2=H.|last3=Fasihipour|first3=Z.|title=The modality effect in learner-paced multimedia learning.|journal=Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2011|volume=30|pages=1488–1493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learners tend to do best when the narration stops after a short, meaningful segment of content is given and the learner has to click a "continue" button in order to start the next segment. Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, fast forward, reverse buttons.&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011" /&gt; Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a pause button that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Khacharem, A., Spanjers, I. A., Zoudji, B., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Ripoll, H., "Using segmentation to support the learning from animated soccer scenes: An effect of prior knowledge." Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 14(2), 154-160, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatsidimitris, G., &amp; Kalyuga, S., "Guided self-management of transient information in animations through pacing and sequencing strategies." Educational Technology Research and Development, 61(1), 91-105, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Personalization principle:''' Deeper learning in multimedia lessons occur when learners experience a stronger social presence, as when a conversational script or learning agents are used.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; The effect is best seen when the tone of voice is casual, informal, and in a 1st person ("I" or "we") or 2nd person ("you") voice.&lt;ref&gt;Kartal, G., "Does language matter in multimedia learning? Personalization principle revisited." Journal of Educational Psychology, 102(3), 615, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the following two sentences, the second version conveys more of a casual, informal, conversational tone: 
::A. The learner should have the sense that someone is talking directly to them when they hear the narration.
::B. Your learner should feel like someone is talking directly to them when they hear your narration.
:Also, research suggests that using a polite tone of voice ("You may want to try multiplying both sides of the equation by 10.") leads to deeper learning for low prior knowledge learners than does a less polite, more directive tone of voice ("Multiply both sides of the equation by 10."), but may impair deeper learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, N., Johnson, W. L., Mayer, R. E., Rizzo, P., Shaw, E., &amp; Collins, H., "The politeness effect: Pedagogical agents and learning outcomes." International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66(2), 98-112, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. (2011). A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors. International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, adding pedagogical agents (computer characters) can help if used to reinforce important content. For example, have the character narrate the lesson, point out critical features in on-screen graphics, or visually demonstrate concepts to the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Dow, G., &amp; Mayer, S., "Multimedia learning in an interactive self-explaining environment: What works in the design of agent-based microworlds?" Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, 806–813, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Mayer, R.E., Spires, H., &amp; Lester, J., "The case for social agency in computer-based teaching: Do students learn more deeply when they interact with animated pedagogical agents?" Cognition and Instruction, 19, 177–214, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, R.K. (2002). Optimizing learning from examples using animated pedagogical agents. Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 416–427, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; DaPra, C. S., "An embodiment effect in computer-based learning with animated pedagogical agents." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 18(3), 239, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Reislein, M., &amp; Ozogul, G., "Using virtual peers to guide visual attention during learning." Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications, 22(2), 52-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pre-training principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lessons present key concepts or vocabulary prior to presenting the processes or procedures related to those concepts.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; According to Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzel,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Mathias, A., &amp; Wetzell, K., "Fostering understanding of multimedia messages through pretraining: Evidence for a two-stage theory of mental model construction." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, 147–154, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Before presenting a multimedia explanation, make sure learners visually recognize each major component, can name each component and can describe the major state changes of each component. In short, make sure learners build component models before presenting a cause-and-effect explanation of how a system works." However, others have noted that including pre-training content appears to be more important for low prior knowledge learners than for high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, E., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Assimilating complex information." Learning and Instruction, 12, 61–86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, P., "Impact of reducing intrinsic cognitive load on learning in a mathematical domain." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20(3), 287-298, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T., Ayres, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "The impact of sequencing and prior knowledge on learning mathematics through spreadsheet applications." Educational Technology Research and Development, 53(3), 15-24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Redundancy principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lesson graphics are explained by audio narration alone rather than audio narration and on-screen text.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; This effect is stronger when the lesson is fast-paced and the words are familiar to the learners. Exceptions to this principle include: screens with no visuals, learners who are not native speakers of the course language, and placement of only a few key words on the screen (i.e., labelling critical elements of the graphic image).&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R.E., "Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning: When reading helps listening." Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 156–163, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheiter, K., Schüler, A., Gerjets, P., Huk, T., &amp; Hesse, F. W., "Extending multimedia research: How do prerequisite knowledge and reading comprehension affect learning from text and pictures." Computers in Human Behavior, 31, 73-84, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Cognitive load theory and the format of instruction." Cognition and Instruction, 8, 293-332, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expertise effect:''' Instructional methods, such as those described above, that are helpful to domain novices or low prior knowledge learners may have no effect or may even depress learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J. "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction." Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors." International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A. "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such principles may not apply outside of laboratory conditions. For example, Muller found that adding approximately 50% additional extraneous but interesting material did not result in any significant difference in learner performance.&lt;ref name="Muller2008" /&gt; There is ongoing debate concerning the mechanisms underlying these beneficial principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabbers, Martens, Merriënboer|title=The modality effect in multimedia instructions|url=http://ou.nl/Docs/Expertise/OTEC/Publicaties/huib%20tabbers/Cognitive%20Science%202001%20Huib%20Tabbers.pdf|publisher=[[Open University of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on what [[Boundary critique|boundary]] conditions may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinwein|title=Does the Modality Effect Exist? and if So, Which Modality Effect?|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|year=2012|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w155x19117733217/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning theories==

{{Main article|Learning theory (education)}}

Good pedagogical practice has a theory of learning at its core. However, no single best-practice [[e-learning]] standard has emerged. This may be unlikely given the range of learning and teaching styles, the potential ways technology can be implemented and the ways in which [[educational technology]] itself is changing.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, S. and B. Newton (2003). "Models of eLearning: Technology Promise vs Learner Needs Literature Review." The International Journal of Management Education 3(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pedagogical]] approaches or [[learning theories]] may be considered in designing and interacting with [[e-learning]] programs.

'''Social-[[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]]'''&amp;nbsp;– this pedagogy is particularly well afforded by the use of discussion forums, blogs, wiki and online collaborative activities. It is a collaborative approach that opens educational content creation to a wider group including the students themselves. The [[One Laptop Per Child|One Laptop Per Child Foundation]] attempted to use a constructivist approach in its project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Constructivism Wiki.Laptop.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurillard's conversational model'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjr/dolweb/docs/laurillardmoddoc.htm Informal description of Laurillard's Model]&lt;/ref&gt; is also particularly relevant to eLearning, and [[Gilly Salmon]]'s Five-Stage Model is a pedagogical approach to the use of discussion boards.&lt;ref&gt;E-moderating: The Key to Teaching and Learning Online&amp;nbsp;– Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7494-4085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive perspective''' focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning as well as how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., and D. R. Krathwohl. (1956). Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional perspective''' focuses on the emotional aspects of learning, like motivation, engagement, fun, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bååth, J. A. (1982) "Distance Students' Learning&amp;nbsp;– Empirical Findings and Theoretical Deliberations"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioural perspective''' focuses on the skills and behavioural outcomes of the learning process. Role-playing and application to on-the-job settings.&lt;ref&gt;Areskog, N-H. (1995) The Tutorial Process&amp;nbsp;– the Roles of Student Teacher and Tutor in a Long Term Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual perspective''' focuses on the environmental and social aspects which can stimulate learning. Interaction with other people, collaborative discovery and the importance of peer support as well as pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. &amp; McClintock, R. (1995) "An Interpretation Construction Approach to Constructivist Design."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mode neutral''' Convergence or promotion of ‘transmodal’ learning where online and classroom learners can coexist within one learning environment thus encouraging interconnectivity and the harnessing of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith B, Reed P &amp; Jones C (2008)  ‘Mode Neutral’ pedagogy. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning."&lt;/ref&gt;

For many theorists, it’s the interaction between student and teacher and student and student in the online environment that enhances learning (Mayes and de Freitas 2004). Pask’s theory that learning occurs through conversations about a subject which in turn helps to make knowledge explicit has an obvious application to learning within a  [[Virtual learning environment|VLE]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon developed a five-stage model of e-learning and e-moderating that for some time has had a major influence where online courses and online discussion forums have been used.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005"&gt;Salmon, G. (2005). E-moderating, the key to teaching and learning online. Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; In her five-stage model, individual access and the ability of students to use the technology are the first steps to involvement and achievement. The second step involves students creating an identity online and finding others with whom to interact; online socialisation is a critical element of the e-learning process in this model. In step 3 students are giving and sharing information relevant to the course to each other. Collaborative interaction amongst students is central to step 4. The fifth step in Salmon’s model involves students looking for benefits from the system and using resources from outside of it to deepen their learning. Throughout all of this, the tutor/teacher/lecturer fulfils the role of moderator or e-moderator, acting as a facilitator of student learning.

Some criticism is now beginning to emerge. Her model does not easily transfer to other contexts (she developed it with experience from an Open University distance learning course). It ignores the variety of learning approaches that are possible within computer mediated communication (CMC) and the range of learning theories that are available (Moule 2007).

===Self-regulation===
[[Self-regulated learning]] refers to several concepts that play major roles in learning, and which have significant relevance in e-learning. Zimmerman (1998){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--recently added "citation" without adequate specifics; is this a reference that's being taken from the Peter Williams book, right below? --&gt; explains that in order to develop self-regulation, learning courses should offer opportunities for students to practice strategies and skills by themselves. Self-regulation is also strongly related to a student's social sources such as parents and teachers. Moreover, Steinberg (1996) found that high-achieving students usually have high-expectation parents who monitor their children closely.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;Peter E. Williams and Chan M. Hllman(Feb.,2004). Differences in self-regulation for online learning between first-and second-generation college students.''Research in Higher Education'', Vol. 45, No.1, pp. 71-82.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197287&lt;/ref&gt;

With the academic environment, self-regulated learners usually set their academic goals and monitor and react themselves in process in order to achieve their goals. Schunk argues, "students must regulate not only their actions but also their underlying achievement-related cognitions, beliefs, intentions and effects"(p.&amp;nbsp;359). Moreover, academic self-regulation also helps students develop confidence in their ability to perform well in e-learning courses.&lt;ref name="Williams2004" /&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===
E-learning literature identifies an ecology of concepts, from  a bibliometric study  were identified the most used concepts associated with the use of computers in learning contexts, e.g. computer assisted  instruction (CAI), computer assisted learning (CAL), computer-based education (CBE), e-learning, learning management systems (LMS), self-directed learning (SDL), and massive open online courses (MOOC). All these concepts have two aspects in common: learning and computers; except the SDL concept, which derives from psychology, and does not necessarily apply to computer usage. These concepts are yet to be studied in scientific research, and stand in contrast to MOOCs. Nowadays, e-learning can also mean massive distribution of content and global classes for all the Internet users. E-learning studies can be focused on three principal dimensions: users, technology, and services. According to Aparicio, Bacao &amp; Oliveira&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aparicio|first=M.|last2=Bacao|first2=F.|last3=Oliveira|first3=T.|date=|year=2016|title=An e-Learning Theoretical Framework|url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/19_1/24.pdf|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|publisher=IEEE|volume=19 |issue=1|pages=292–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The e-learning systems' theoretical framework contains the three main components of information systems. These components are people, technologies, and services. People interact with e-learning systems. E-learning technologies enable the direct or indirect interaction of the different groups of users. Technologies provide support to integrate content, enable communication, and provide collaboration tools. E-learning services integrate all the activities corresponding to pedagogical models and to instructional strategies. The complex interaction combination is the direct or indirect action with e-learning systems. At the same time, systems provide services according to the specified strategies for activities. In other words, service specifications are e-learning activities aligned with the e-learning pedagogical models and the instructional strategies''".

==Teacher use of technology==

Computing technology was not created by teachers. There has been little consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it. Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (2006). Rethinking University Teaching: a framework for the effective use of learning technologies. Abingdon, Oxon., RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery.&lt;ref name="Galanouli2004" /&gt; The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training, by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).

Newer generation [[web 2.0]] services provide customizable, inexpensive platforms for authoring and disseminating multimedia-rich e-learning courses, and do not need specialised [[information technology]] (IT) support.&lt;ref&gt;Tam CW, Eastwood A. Available, intuitive and free! Building e-learning modules using web 2.0 services.Med Teach. 2012;34(12):1078-80. {{DOI|10.3109/0142159X.2012.731105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eating Too Fast''''' is a 1966 [[Andy Warhol]] film made at [[The Factory]]. It was originally titled '''''Blow Job #2''''' and features art critic and writer Gregory Battcock (1937–1980). The film is 67 minutes long and is, in effect, a black and white [[sound film]] remake of Warhol's ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]'' (1964). Battcock had previously appeared in Warhol's films ''[[Batman Dracula]]'' (1964) and ''Horse'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1f/eating.html |title=WarholStars entry |access-date=2012-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219215924/http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/warhol1f/eating.html |archive-date=2011-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production background==
The [[British Film Institute]] catalogue says that the first half of the film is a still shot, showing Battcock eating an apple and taking a phone call, while apparently receiving [[fellatio]]. The second half of the film has more camera movement.  Battcock's diaries say the film was made in Battcock's [[Greenwich Village]] apartment with Warhol and [[Lou Reed]] present for the filming.

A '''geographic names board''' is an official body established by a government to decide on official names for geographical areas and features.

Most countries have such a body, which is commonly (but not always) known under this name. Also, in some countries (especially those organised on a federal basis), subdivisions such as individual states or provinces will have individual boards.

Duthuit was a key commentator on [[Matisse]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], and [[Bram van Velde]]. He maintained a close association with the [[surrealists]], particularly [[André Masson]]. In 1939, he was among the intellectuals convened for [[Georges Bataille|George Bataille's]] [[College of Sociology]]. Part of his correspondences on contemporary art with [[Samuel Beckett]] form the text ''[[Three Dialogues]]'', originally published in the literary journal, ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]''.

'''Green Star''' is a voluntary sustainability rating system for buildings in [[Australia]]. It was launched in 2003 by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]. 

The Green Star rating system assesses the sustainability of projects at all stages of the built environment life cycle.  Ratings can be achieved at the planning phase for communities, during the design, construction or fit out phase of buildings, or during the ongoing operational phase.

The system considers assesses and rates buildings, fitouts and communities against a range of environmental impact categories, and aims to encourage leadership in environmentally sustainable design and construction, showcase innovation in sustainable building practices, and consider occupant health, productivity and operational cost savings.

In 2013, the GBCA released a report, ''The Value of Green Star'', which analysed data from 428 Green Star-certified projects occupying 5,746,000 million square metres across Australia and compared it to the ‘average’ Australian building and minimum practice benchmarks.  The research found that, on average, Green Star-certified buildings produce 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 66% less electricity than average Australian buildings.  Green Star buildings use 51% less potable water than average buildings. Green Star-certified buildings also have been found to recycle 96 per cent of their construction and demolition waste, compared to the average 58% for new construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/resources/gbca-publications/the-value-of-green-star/34754.htm Green Building Council of Australia: ''The Value of Green Star'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating system==
Green Star benchmarks projects against the nine Green Star categories of: Management; Indoor Environment Quality; Energy; Transport; Water; Materials; Land Use &amp; Ecology; Emissions and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/ Green Building Council of Australia: 'Green Star overview']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within each category are credits which address specific aspects of sustainable building design, construction or performance. Ratings for buildings are available at the design stage ('Design' ratings), at the post-construction phase (known as 'As Built' ratings) or for interior fitouts (‘Interiors’ ratings).

Green Star - Communities rates projects at the community or precinct scale against the categories of: Liveability; Economic Prosperity; Environment; Design; Governance and Innovation.

Green Star certification is a formal process in which an independent assessment panel reviews documentary evidence that a project meets Green Star benchmarks within each credit. The assessment panel awards points, with a Green Star rating determined by comparing the overall score with the rating scale:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Score

! Category
|-
| 10-19

| 45-59
| Four Star
| Best Practice
|-
| 60-56

| Five Star
| Australian Excellence
|-
| 75+

|}

Green Star rating tools for building, fitout and community design and construction reward projects that achieve best practice or above, which means ratings of 1, 2 or 3 are not awarded. Ongoing performance of a building can be rated at any of the 6 star ratings.

Buildings assessed using the Green Star – Performance rating tool will be able to achieve a Green Star rating from 1 – 6 Star Green Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/the-green-star-rating-scale/ | title = The Green Star Rating Scale | publisher = Green Building Council Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gbcaus.org/docs/GBCA_OfficeExBuildingSHEET.pdf | title = Rating Tool Fact Sheet | publisher = Green Building Council of Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
More than 1900 projects around Australia have achieved Green Star ratings.  The first building to achieve a Green Star rating was 8 Brindabella Circuit at [[Canberra Airport]], which achieved a 5 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating in 2004.  In 2005, [[Council House 2]] in Melbourne became the first building to achieve a 6 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating.  [[Flinders Medical Centre]] – New South Wing was the first healthcare facility in Australia to achieve a Green Star rating.  [[Bond University]] Mirvac School for Sustainability achieved the first Green Star rating for an educational facility.  Other well-known Green Star projects include [[1 Bligh Street]] in Sydney and the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]].

== Controversy ==
The launch of the Green Star rating system was met with some scepticism by green groups, which argued that the rating system was funded by mostly development industry companies.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106048784.html Article summarising the launch of Green Star after Australian Financial Review]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was controversy over a proposal to expand the forest certification of timber and composite timber products, but this issue was resolved with the release of the revised ‘Timber’ credit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/green-star-rating-to-focus-on-legal-timber-20091220-l7in.html Sydney Morning Herald: Green Star rating to focus on legal timber]&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been concern over various aspects of the timeframe for awarding of the certification, transfer of properties once awarded, and termination rights.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=59652 Article looking at the application process on Mondaq.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics''' ('''IPAM''') is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematics]] institute funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]. The initial funding for the institute was approved in May 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = NSF Opts for Three Institutes: UCLA's IPAM To Join IMA, MSRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated in  August, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/reception.html | title = Inaugural Lectures  and Opening Reception   Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPAM is located on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus, in close proximity to UCLA's Department of Mathematics. The building currently housing the institute was designed in  1973 by world-renowned [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = Newest NSF Institute Open Its Doors, Notices of the AMS, Volume 47, Number 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of the institute is to make connections between a broad spectrum of mathematicians and scientists, to launch new collaborations, to better inform mathematicians and scientists about interdisciplinary problems, and to broaden the range of applications in which mathematics is used.

IPAM seeks to bring the full range of mathematical techniques to bear on the great scientific challenges of our time, to stimulate exciting new mathematics via new problems motivated by other sciences, and to train the people who will do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/about.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; About Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
IPAM is currently one of eight [http://www.mathinstitutes.org NSF Mathematical Sciences Institutes] in the [[United States]]. The initial five year grant was renewed in 2005, and this grant was once again renewed in 2010, for an additional five years.

The institute was co-founded by [[Tony F. Chan]], Mark Green, and [[Eitan Tadmor]]; [[Russel E. Caflisch|Russ Caflisch]] is its current director. Christian Ratsch and [[Skip Garibaldi]] are its current associate directors. [[Stanley Osher]] is its current special projects director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/people/directors.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; Directors Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Every year IPAM offers two three-month scientific programs, or long programs. These programs bring together senior and junior mathematicians and scientists and engineers from the scientific disciplines related to the program. In addition, IPAM supports graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and young academics to encourage their participation in long programs.

The programs consist of three phases: Tutorials from both streams are offered at the beginning. These are followed by four five-day workshops focusing on particular topics related to the overall theme of the program. The programs culminate with a 1-week [[Oberwolfach]]-like workshop at the [[UCLA]] at [[Lake Arrowhead, California]].

Between the long programs, IPAM sponsors independent five-day workshops on a broad range of scientific themes. During the summer IPAM holds a research program for undergraduates (RIPS) focusing on industrial problems as well as a summer school for graduate students. The graduate student summer school is dedicated to an important scientific theme involving problems of mathematical interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">'''King Ahaz's seal''' is a [[Bulla (seal)|bulla]] (impressed piece of clay) originating from the 8th century BCE. The place of discovery of this seal is unknown, and it is currently part of [[Shlomo Moussaieff (businessman)|Shlomo Moussaieff]]'s private collection. The seal contains an [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|ancient Hebrew]] inscription mentioning the name of [[Ahaz]] of Judah, as well as the name of his father, [[Jotham of Judah|Yehotam]] (Jotham), identifying Ahaz as the "king of Judah". The bulla contains a fingerprint which may belong to Ahaz himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m1&lt;/ref&gt;

Another extra-biblical source regarding the historicity of Ahaz comes from [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], mentioning tributes he received in gold and silver from Ahaz, and from the bulla known as [[Ushna seal]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger, Stephen L. Bible and Spade, Oxford University Press, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal answer of all experts in the field is no. It is simply impossible to fake them."]&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Andrew Vaughn, agree that it would be difficult to fake a bulla, but do not rule out such a possibility, and in fact conclude that some bullae are forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.bible-translation.net/upload/2891/Real_or_Fake_A_Special_Report.pdf Hershel Shanks, Jerusalem Forgery Conference Report, p. 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orte und Landschaften der Bibel.

'''Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory''' ('''LLNL''') is a federal research facility in [[Livermore, California]], [[United States]], founded by the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1952. A [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]] (FFRDC), it is primarily funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) and managed and operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), a partnership of the University of California, [[Bechtel]], [[BWX Technologies]], [[AECOM]], and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] in affiliation with the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]].  In 2012, the laboratory had the synthetic chemical element [[livermorium]] named after it.

==Background==
[[File:LLNL Aerial View.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]
LLNL is self-described as "a premier [[research and development]] institution for science and technology applied to [[national security]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Missions &amp; Programs | url=http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/missions | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date=February 13, 2008 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its principal responsibility is ensuring the safety, security and reliability of the nation's [[nuclear weapon]]s through the application of advanced science, engineering and technology. The Laboratory also applies its special expertise and multidisciplinary capabilities to preventing the [[wikt:proliferation|proliferation]] and use of [[weapons of mass destruction]], bolstering [[homeland security]] and solving other nationally important problems, including [[energy]] and [[environmental security]], basic science and economic competitiveness.

The Laboratory is located on a one-square-mile (2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) site at the eastern edge of Livermore. It also operates a {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} remote experimental test site, called Site 300, situated about {{convert|15|mi}} southeast of the main lab site. LLNL has an annual budget of about [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 billion and a staff of roughly 5,800 employees.

==Origins==
LLNL was established in 1952 as the '''University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore''', an offshoot of the existing [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|UC Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley]].  It was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear weapon design laboratory at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in [[New Mexico]], home of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the first [[atomic weapons]]. [[Edward Teller]] and [[Ernest Lawrence]],&lt;ref&gt;http://education.llnl.gov/archives/ ''Multimedia timeline of EO Lawrence''&lt;/ref&gt; director of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, are regarded as the co-founders of the Livermore facility.

The new laboratory was sited at a former [[Naval Air Station Livermore|naval air station]] of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].  It  was already home to several UC Radiation Laboratory projects that were too large for its location in the [[Berkeley Hills]] above the UC campus, including one of the first experiments in the magnetic approach to confined thermonuclear reactions (i.e. fusion). About half an hour southeast of Berkeley, the Livermore site provided much greater security for classified projects than an urban university campus.

Lawrence tapped 32-year-old [[Herbert York]], a former graduate student of his, to run Livermore. Under York, the Lab had four main programs: [[Project Sherwood]] (the magnetic-fusion program), Project Whitney (the weapons-design program), diagnostic weapon experiments (both for the Los Alamos and Livermore laboratories), and a basic physics program. York and the new lab embraced the Lawrence "big science" approach, tackling challenging projects with physicists, chemists, engineers, and computational scientists working together in multidisciplinary teams. Lawrence died in August 1958 and shortly after, the university's board of regents named both laboratories for him, as the '''Lawrence Radiation Laboratory'''.

Historically, the Berkeley and Livermore laboratories have had very close relationships on research projects, business operations, and staff. The Livermore Lab was established initially as a branch of the Berkeley laboratory. The Livermore lab was not officially severed administratively from the Berkeley lab until 1971. To this day, in official planning documents and records, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] is designated as Site 100, Lawrence Livermore National Lab as Site 200, and LLNL's remote test location as Site 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Short History of the Laboratory at Livermore | author="Science and Technology Review (September 1998)" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory was renamed '''Lawrence Livermore Laboratory''' ('''LLL''') in 1971. On October 1, 2007 LLNS assumed management of LLNL from the University of California, which had exclusively managed and operated the Laboratory since its inception 55 years before. The laboratory was honored in 2012 by having the synthetic chemical element [[livermorium]] named after it. The LLNS takeover of the laboratory has been controversial.  In May 2013, an Alameda County jury awarded over $2.7 million to five former laboratory employees who were among 430 employees LLNS laid off during 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=$2.7 Million Awarded to Former Lab Employees |author=Jeff Garberson |date=May 16, 2013 |work=The Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury found that LLNS breached a contractual obligation to terminate the employees only for "reasonable cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laid Off Lab Workers Awarded $2.8 Million |author=Max Taves |date=May 10, 2013 |work=The Recorder }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The five plaintiffs also have pending age discrimination claims against LLNS, which will be heard by a different jury in a separate trial.&lt;ref name="Bob Egelko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Livermore lab jury awards $2.7 million |author=Bob Egelko |date=May 13, 2013 |work=SF Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 125 co-plaintiffs awaiting trial on similar claims against LLNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Five Former Livermore Workers Receive $2.7 Million in Layoff Case |author=Todd Jacobson |date=May 17, 2013 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Materials Monitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 2008 layoff was the first layoff at the laboratory in nearly 40 years.&lt;ref name="Bob Egelko"/&gt;

On March 14, 2011, the City of Livermore officially expanded the city's boundaries to annex LLNL and move it within the city limits. The unanimous vote by the Livermore city council expanded Livermore's southeastern boundaries to cover 15 land parcels covering {{convert|1,057|acre|km2}} that comprise the LLNL site. The site was formerly an unincorporated area of Alameda County. The LLNL campus continues to be owned by the federal government.

==Nuclear weapons projects==
From its inception, Livermore focused on new weapon design concepts; as a result, its first three [[nuclear test]]s were unsuccessful. The lab persevered and its subsequent designs proved increasingly successful. In 1957, the Livermore Lab was selected to develop the warhead for the Navy's [[Polaris missile]]. This warhead required numerous innovations to fit a nuclear warhead into the relatively small confines of the missile nosecone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author="Global Security" | title=Weapons of Mass Destruction: Miniaturization | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/miniaturization.htm | date=April 27, 2005 | accessdate=June 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], many Livermore-designed [[warhead]]s entered service. These were used in missiles ranging in size from the [[MGM-52 Lance|Lance]] surface-to-surface tactical missile to the megaton-class [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan antiballistic missile]]. Over the years, LLNL designed the following warheads: [[Mark 27 nuclear bomb|W27]] (Regulus cruise missile; 1955; joint with Los Alamos), [[W38]] (Atlas/Titan ICBM; 1959), [[B41 nuclear bomb|B41]] (B52 bomb; 1957), [[W45]] (Little John/Terrier missiles; 1956), [[W47]] (Polaris SLBM; 1957), [[W48]] (155-mm howitzer; 1957), [[W55]] (submarine rocket; 1959), [[W56]] (Minuteman ICBM; 1960), [[W58]] (Polaris SLBM; 1960), [[W62]] (Minuteman ICBM; 1964), [[W68]] (Poseidon SLBM; 1966), [[W70]] (Lance missile; 1969), [[W71]] (Spartan missile; 1968), [[W79]] (8-in. artillery gun; 1975), [[W82]] (155-mm howitzer; 1978), [[B83 nuclear bomb|B83]] (modern strategic bomb; 1979), and [[W87]] (Peacekeeper/MX ICBM; 1982). The W87 and the B83 are the only LLNL designs still in the U.S. nuclear stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=James N. Gibson | title=Complete List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons | url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html | work=The Nuclear Weapon Archive | date=October 14, 2006 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Nuclear Weapon Enduring Stockpile | url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Wpngall.html | work=The Nuclear Weapon Archive | date=August 31, 2007 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship | url=http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/missions/nwss.jsp | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date=February 13, 2008 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the end of the [[Cold War]], the United States began a moratorium on nuclear testing and development of new nuclear weapon designs. To sustain existing warheads for the indefinite future, a science-based [[Stockpile stewardship|Stockpile Stewardship]] Program (SSP) was defined that emphasized the development and application of greatly improved technical capabilities to assess the safety, security, and reliability of existing nuclear warheads without the use of nuclear testing. Confidence in the performance of weapons, without nuclear testing, is maintained through an ongoing process of stockpile surveillance, assessment and certification, and refurbishment or weapon replacement.

With no new designs of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. stockpile must continue to function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the [[Reliable Replacement Warhead]] (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Lindlaw |title=Bush Administration Picks Lawrence Livermore Warhead Design |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/02/state/n091011S16.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031319/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F02%2Fstate%2Fn091011S16.DTL |archivedate=March 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.

==Plutonium research==
LLNL conducts research into the properties and behavior of [[plutonium]] to learn how plutonium performs as it ages and how it behaves under high pressure (e.g., with the impact of high explosives). Plutonium has seven temperature-dependent solid [[allotropy|allotropes]]. Each possesses a different density and [[crystal structure]]. Alloys of plutonium are even more complex; multiple phases can be present in a sample at any given time. Experiments are being conducted at LLNL and elsewhere to measure the structural, electrical and chemical properties of plutonium and its alloys and to determine how these materials change over time. Such measurements will enable scientists to better model and predict plutonium's long-term behavior in the aging stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Plutonium Up Close...Way Close | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/March01/Schwartz.html | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | accessdate=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lab's plutonium research is conducted in a specially designed facility called the SuperBlock, with emphasis on safety and security. Work with highly enriched uranium is also conducted here. In March 2008, the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA) presented its preferred alternative for the transformation of the nation's nuclear weapons complex. Under this plan, LLNL would be a center of excellence for nuclear design and engineering, a center of excellence for high explosive research and development, and a science magnet in high-energy-density (i.e., laser) [[physics]]. In addition, most of its special nuclear material would be removed and consolidated at a more central, yet-to-be-named site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Fact Sheet for NNSA Complex Transformation&amp;ndash; Preferred Alternative |url=http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/defense_programs/documents/LivermoreFactSheet_v8.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030827/http://nnsa.energy.gov/defense_programs/documents/LivermoreFactSheet_v8.pdf |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2009, the NNSA announced that about two thirds of the special nuclear material (e.g., plutonium) at LLNL requiring the highest level of security protection had been removed from LLNL. The move was part of NNSA's efforts initiated in October 2006 to consolidate special nuclear material at five sites by 2012, with significantly reduced square footage at those sites by 2017. The federally mandated project intends to improve security and reduce security costs, and is part of NNSA's overall effort to transform the Cold War era "nuclear weapons" enterprise into a 21st-century "nuclear security" enterprise. The original date to remove all high-security nuclear material from LLNL, based on equipment capability and capacity, was 2014. NNSA and LLNL developed a timeline to remove this material as early as possible, accelerating the target completion date to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnsa.energy.gov/2628.htm NNSA Press Release, September 30, 2009, NNSA Ships Additional Special Nuclear Material from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as Part of Deinventory Project]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global security program==
The Lab's work in global security aims to reduce and mitigate the dangers posed by the spread or use of weapons of mass destruction and by threats to energy and environmental security. Livermore has been working on global security and homeland security for decades, predating both the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. LLNL staff have been heavily involved in the cooperative nonproliferation programs with Russia to secure at-risk weapons materials and assist former weapons workers in developing peaceful applications and self-sustaining job opportunities for their expertise and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author="Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory" | title=Scientists without Borders  | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Nov07/bissani.html |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | title=Out of Harm's Way | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Dec07/bissani.html |date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, Lab scientists began efforts to devise improved biodetection capabilities, leading to miniaturized and autonomous instruments that can detect biothreat agents in a few minutes instead of the days to weeks previously required for DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | title= Characterizing Virulent Pathogens | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Nov07/slezak.html |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | title= Assessing the Threat of Bioterrorism | url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Sep07/Bates.html | date= September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Largest computers==
Throughout its history, LLNL has been a leader in computers and scientific computing. Even before the Livermore Lab opened its doors, E.O. Lawrence and Edward Teller recognized the importance of computing and the potential of computational simulation. Their purchase of one of the first UNIVAC computers set the precedent for LLNL's history of acquiring and exploiting the fastest and most capable supercomputers in the world. A succession of increasingly powerful and fast computers have been used at the Lab over the years. LLNL researchers use supercomputers to answer questions about subjects such as materials science simulations, [[global warming]], and reactions to natural disasters.

LLNL has a long history of developing computing [[software]] and systems. Initially, there was no commercially available software, and computer manufacturers considered it the customer's responsibility to develop their own. Users of the early computers had to write not only the codes to solve their technical problems, but also the routines to run the machines themselves. Today, LLNL computer scientists focus on creating the highly complex physics models, visualization codes, and other unique applications tailored to specific research requirements. A great deal of software also has been written by LLNL personnel to optimize the operation and management of the computer systems, including operating system extensions such as [[CHAOS (Linux Clustering)]] and resource management packages such as [[SLURM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Linux at Livermore | url=https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/ | publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC)==
In August 2009 a joint venture was announced between [[Sandia National Laboratories]]/California campus and LLNL to create an open, unclassified research and development space called the Livermore Valley Open Campus (LVOC). The motivation for the LVOC stems from current and future national security challenges that require increased coupling to the private sector to understand threats and deploy solutions in areas such as high performance computing, energy and environmental security, cyber security, economic security, and non-proliferation.

The LVOC is modeled after research and development campuses found at major industrial research parks and other U.S. Department of Energy laboratories with campus-like security, a set of business and operating rules devised to enhance and accelerate international scientific collaboration and partnerships with U.S. government agencies, industry and academia. Ultimately, the LVOC will consist of an approximately 110-acre parcel along the eastern edge of the Livermore Laboratory and Sandia sites, and will house additional conference space, collaboration facilities and a visitor's center to support educational and research activities.

Objectives of LVOC

*Enhance the two laboratories' national security missions by substantially increasing engagement with the private sector and academic community.
*Stay at the forefront of the science, technology and engineering fields.
*Ensure a quality future workforce by expanding opportunities for open engagement of the broader scientific community.

Three other directorates are each headed by an Associate Director who reports to the LLNL Director:

* Computation
* Engineering
* Physical &amp; Life Sciences

==Corporate management==
The LLNL Director reports to the Lawrence Livermore National Security, [[Limited liability company|LLC]] (LLNS) Board of Governors, a group of key scientific, academic, national security and business leaders from the LLNS partner companies that jointly own and control LLNS. The LLNS Board of Governors has a total of 16 positions, with six of these Governors constituting an Executive Committee. All decisions of the Board are made by the Governors on the Executive Committee. The other Governors are advisory to the Executive Committee and do not have voting rights.

The University of California is entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Chair. Bechtel is also entitled to appoint three Governors to the Executive Committee, including the Vice Chair. One of the Bechtel Governors must be a representative of Babcock &amp; Wilcox (B&amp;W) or the Washington Division of URS Corporation (URS), who is nominated jointly by B&amp;W and URS each year, and who must be approved and appointed by Bechtel. The Executive Committee has a seventh Governor who is appointed by Battelle; they are non-voting and advisory to the Executive Committee. The remaining Board positions are known as Independent Governors (also referred to as Outside Governors), and are selected from among individuals, preferably of national stature, and can not be employees or officers of the partner companies.

The University of California-appointed Chair has tie-breaking authority over most decisions of the Executive Committee. The Board of Governors is the ultimate governing body of LLNS and is charged with overseeing the affairs of LLNS in its operations and management of LLNL.

LLNS managers and employees who work at LLNL, up to and including the President/Laboratory Director, are generally referred to as Laboratory Employees. All Laboratory Employees report directly or indirectly to the LLNS President. While most of the work performed by LLNL is funded by the federal government, Laboratory employees are paid by LLNS which is responsible for all aspects of their employment including providing health care benefits and retirement programs.

Within the Board of Governors, authority resides in the Executive Committee to exercise all rights, powers, and authorities of LLNS, excepting only certain decisions that are reserved to the parent companies. The LLNS Executive Committee is free to appoint officers or other managers of LLNS and LLNL, and may delegate its authorities as it deems appropriate to such officers, employees, or other representatives of LLNS/LLNL. The Executive Committee may also retain auditors, attorneys, or other professionals as necessary. For the most part the Executive Committee has appointed senior managers at LLNL as the primary officers of LLNS. As a practical matter most operational decisions are delegated to the President of LLNS, who is also the Laboratory Director.  The positions of President/Laboratory Director and Deputy Laboratory Director are filled by joint action of the Chair and Vice Chair of the Executive Committee, with the University of California nominating the President/Laboratory Director and Bechtel nominating the Deputy Laboratory Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/acsconl/reports.html An Introductory Guide to UC’s Ties to LANS LLC and LLNS LLC and their Management of the Weapons Labs at Los Alamos and Livermore, prepared by the UC Academic Council and University Counsel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529185057/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/committees/acsconl/reports.html |date=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current LLNS Chairman is [[Norman J. Pattiz]], founder and chairman of [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]], America's largest radio network, who also currently serves on the Board of Regents of the University of California. The Vice Chairman is J. Scott Ogilvie, president of Bechtel Systems &amp; Infrastructure, Inc., who also serves on the Board of Directors of Bechtel Group, Inc. (BGI) and on the BGI Audit Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llnsllc.com/aboutUs/bog2008.asp|title=Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC|publisher=|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public protests==
The Livermore Action Group organized many mass protests, from 1981 to 1984, against nuclear weapons which were being produced by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Peace activists Ken Nightingale and Eldred Schneider were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Epstein.

[[Artificial intelligence]] researchers have developed several specialized '''programming languages for artificial intelligence''':

== Languages ==
* [[AIML]] (meaning "Artificial Intelligence Markup Language")&lt;ref name="AIML_Repository"&gt;according to (the intro page to) the [http://nlp-addiction.com/chatbot/aiml/ AIML Repository] at nlp-addiction.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[XML]] dialect&lt;ref name="alicebot.org_aiml"&gt;See the [http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html AIML "Intro" (web) page] at www.alicebot.org&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity|A.L.I.C.E.]]-type [[chatterbot]]s. 
* [[Information Processing Language|IPL]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=46–48}}
&lt;/ref&gt; was the first language developed for artificial intelligence. It includes features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, such as lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking.
* [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=723–821}}
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=59–62}},
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on [[lambda calculus]]. [[Linked list]]s are one of the Lisp language's major [[data structure]]s, and Lisp [[source code]] is itself made up of lists. As a result, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new [[domain-specific language|domain-specific programming language]]s embedded in Lisp. There are many dialects of Lisp in use today, among which are [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], and [[Clojure]].
* [[Smalltalk]] has been used extensively for simulations, neural networks, machine learning and genetic algorithms. It implements the purest and most elegant form of object-oriented programming using message passing.
* [[Prolog]]&lt;ref&gt;
History of logic programming:
* {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=190–196}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Prolog]]:
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=477–491}},
* {{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=641–676, 575–581}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] language where programs are expressed in terms of relations, and execution occurs by running ''queries'' over these relations. Prolog is particularly useful for symbolic reasoning, database and language parsing applications. Prolog is widely used in AI today.
* [[STRIPS]] is a language for expressing [[automated planning and scheduling|automated planning problem instance]]s. It expresses an initial state, the goal states, and a set of actions. For each action preconditions (what must be established before the action is performed) and postconditions (what is established after the action is performed) are specified.
* [[Planner (programming language)|Planner]] is a hybrid between procedural and logical languages. It gives a procedural interpretation to logical sentences where implications are interpreted with pattern-directed inference.
* [[POP-11]] is a [[Reflection (computer science)|reflective]], [[dynamic compilation|incrementally compiled]] [[programming language]] with many of the features of an [[interpreted language]]. It is the core language of the [[Poplog]] [[Computer programming|programming]] [[system platform|environment]] developed originally by the [[University of Sussex]], and recently in the [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/ School of Computer Science] at the [[University of Birmingham]] which hosts [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html the Poplog website], It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], who find POP syntax more familiar than that of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]. One of POP-11's features is that it supports [[first-class function]]s.
*[[R (programming language)|R]] is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis, the use of Bayesian inference, neural networks and in general [[Machine Learning]]. In domains like finance, biology, sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard languages. It offers several paradigms of programming like vectorial computation, functional programming and object-oriented programming. It supports deep learning libraries like [[MXNet]], [[Keras]] or [[TensorFlow]]. 
* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is widely used for artificial intelligence, with packages for a number of applications including General AI, [[Machine Learning]], [[Natural Language Processing]] and [[Neural Network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence Python For Artificial Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101045354/http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence |date=2012-11-01 }} Python Wiki 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] is also a very good programming language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for search trees. The language's features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs is a bit harder at first because of purity.
* [[Wolfram Language]] includes a wide range of integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, and image.&lt;ref name="Wolfram Language"&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html Wolfram Language]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[C++]] (2011 onwards)
* [[MATLAB]]
* [[Perl]]
* [[Julia (programming language)]], e.g. for machine learning, using native or non-native libraries.

'''Mobile television''' is [[television]] watched on a small [[handheld]] or mobile device. It includes [[pay TV]] service delivered via [[mobile phone]] networks or received [[free-to-air]] via [[terrestrial television]] stations. Regular broadcast standards or special mobile TV transmission formats can be used. Additional features include [[download]]ing [[TV program]]s and [[podcast]]s from the Internet and storing programming for later viewing.

According to the ''Harvard Business Review'', the growing adoption of [[smartphones]] allowed users to watch as much mobile video in three days of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] as they watched throughout the entire [[2008 Summer Olympics]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;an increase of 564%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ Looking for TV Genius? | Red Bee Media]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430000855/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ |date=April 30, 2011 }}[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

Early mobile television receivers were based on the old [[analog television]] signal system. They were the earliest televisions that could be placed in a coat pocket. The first was the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001, introduced in 1970. The second was sold to the public by [[Clive Sinclair]] in January 1977. It was called the Microvision or the [[MTV-1]]. It had a two-inch (50&amp;nbsp;mm) [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen and was also the first television which could pick up signals in multiple countries. It measured 102×159×41&amp;nbsp;mm and was sold for less than [[Pounds sterling|£]]100 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and for around [[US dollar|$]]400 in the [[United States]]. The project took over ten years to develop and was funded by around £1.6 million in British government grants.&lt;ref name="Clive's achievements"&gt;[http://www.sinclair-research.co.uk/about-srl.php Clive's achievements] [[Sinclair Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video and TV gear"&gt;[http://www.retrothing.com/video_tv/index.html Video and TV gear], [[Retrothing.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later decades the term "mobile television" was associated with mobile telephones and other mobile digital devices. Mobile TV is among the features provided by many 3G phones.

&lt;!-- The following paragraph is a huge, convoluted mess. The sources don't agree with the prose. Do we really need every carrier listed? How can South Korea be first to have MTV in 2005 when the sentence before said they had it in 2002? etc. --AlanM1--&gt;
In 2002, South Korea became the first country in the world to have a commercial mobile TV by CDMA IS95-C network, and mobile TV over 3G ([[CDMA2000]] 1X EVDO) also became available in that same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1036976/korean-mobile-content-kings-spill-beans&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, South Korea became the first country in the world to have mobile TV. It started satellite DMB (S-DMB) and terrestrial DMB (T-DMB) services on May 1 and December 1. Today, [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are at the forefront of this developing sector.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com via Yahoo! Finance: [http://biz.yahoo.com/nytimes/080506/1194771946810.html?.v=18 Mobile TV Spreading in Europe and to the U.S.], May 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile TV services were launched by the operator CSL during March 2006 in Hong Kong on the 3G network.&lt;ref&gt;3G UK: The service is based on the [http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/March2006/2732.htm Golden Dynamic Enterprises Ltd.]'s [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Dec_4/ai_n16881105 "VOIR Portal"] and follows the 3GPP standard 3G-324 M. The same service was also deployed to the Philippines in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[British Telecom|BT]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was among the first companies outside South Korea to launch mobile TV in September 2006, although the service was abandoned less than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;ZDnet: [http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39288247,00.htm BT ditches mobile TV service], 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same happened to MFD Mobiles Fernsehen Deutschland, who launched their [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]]-based service June 2006 in Germany, and stopped it in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Broadband TV news: [http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=4682 MFD hands back German T-DMB licence], May 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2006, mobile operator 3 in Italy (part of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]) launched their mobile TV service, but opposed to their counterpart in Germany this was based on [[DVB-H]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Register'': [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/28/dvbh_success_in_italy/ DVB-H rockets ahead in Italy], 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint started offering the service in February 2006 and was the first US carrier to offer the service. In the US [[Verizon Wireless]] and more recently [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] are offering the service.

In South Korea, mobile TV is largely divided into satellite DMB ([[S-DMB]]) and terrestrial DMB ([[T-DMB]]). Although S-DMB initially had more content, T-DMB has gained much wider popularity because it is free and included as a feature in most mobile handsets sold in the country today.

==Challenges==
Mobile TV usage can be divided into three classes:
* "Fixed"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while not moving, possibly moved when not being watched
* "Nomadic"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched while moving slowly (e.g. walking)
* "Mobile"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;watched when moving quickly (e.g. in a car)

Each of these pose different challenges.

===Device manufacturers' challenges===
&lt;!--No explanation for these, and no source. I'm going with something generic for now
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;battery technology for mobile portable devices may be stuck in a race condition. Improved battery life can be used up by the upgraded mobile content and enhanced functions. However, [[dashtop mobile]] devices can also be powered by a 12-volt vehicle battery, however vehicle batteries are not a sustainable source of power for mobile devices. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Power consumption&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;continuous receipt, decoding, and display of video requires continuous power, and cannot benefit from all of the types of optimizations that are used to reduce power consumption for data and voice services.
* Memory&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;to support the large buffer requirements of mobile TV. Currently available{{when|date=August 2012}} memory capabilities are not suited for long hours of mobile TV viewing. Furthermore, potential future applications like [[peer-to-peer video sharing]] in mobile phones and consumer broadcasting would add to the increasing memory requirements{{why?|date=August 2012}}. The existing P2P algorithms are not expected to be enough for mobile devices, necessitating the advent of [[mobile P2P]] algorithms{{why?|date=August 2012}}. There is one start-up technology that claims [[patent]]ability on its mobile P2P, but has not drawn attention from device manufacturers yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

&lt;!--What does this have to do with UI design?
* [[User interface]] design&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a large number of mobile phones do not support mobile TV; users have to purchase new handsets with improved LCD display and user interface that support mobile TV. This new design has to appeal to the end-users and increase the clarity of images without making the handset very bulky. The wider LCD touchscreens has been preferred by end-users and the iPhone's popularity in the United States is part of the compelling evidence. --AlanM1--&gt;
* Display&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;larger and higher-resolution displays are necessary for an optimal viewing experience.
* Processing power&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;significantly more processor performance is required for mobile TV than that used for UI and simple applications, like browsers and messaging.

==Digital television==

===North America===
{{As of|2012|01}}, there were 120 stations in the United States broadcasting using the [[ATSC-M/H]] "Mobile DTV" standard&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;a mobile and handheld enhancement to the HDTV standard that improves handling of [[multipath interference]] while mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMVC announces sizable growth in number of MDTV stations at CES|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012/index.html|website=Broadcast Engineering|accessdate=18 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922040843/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/OMVC-mobile-DTV-presence-announces-growth-CES-01192012|archivedate=22 September 2012|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I don't know what this means. Seems like it's talking about audio, not video.

The FCC also chose [[HD Radio]] which uses COFDM and has reasonable mobile reception, does not have provisions for mobile TV as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]]-T has with [[DMB-T]] and is incompatible even with neighboring [[Canada]], where the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) already chose DAB in the [[L band]]. --AlanM1--&gt;

The defunct [[MediaFLO]] used [[COFDM]] broadcast on [[UHF]] [[TV channel]] 55. Like satellite TV, it was [[encrypt]]ed and controlled by [[conditional access]] (provided via the [[cellular network]]). It required a [[Pay TV|subscription]] for each mobile device, and was limited to the [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] or [[Verizon Wireless]] networks.

===Broadcast mobile DTV development===
&lt;!--Another section in extreme need of a trim --AlanM1--&gt;
While MediaFLO used the TV spectrum and [[MobiTV]] used [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |title=mobile tv cell phone networks: |last=Thompson |first=Mark |date=2010-06-03 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515184507/http://www.mobitv.com/technology/managed-service-platform |archivedate=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "mobile DTV" (ATSC-M/H) used the [[digital TV]] spectrum.

At the April 2007 [[National Association of Broadcasters|National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], the [[ATSC]] and [[8VSB]] methods for delivering mobile DTV were shown. [[A-VSB|Advanced VSB (A-VSB)]], from [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] and [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], was shown at the April 2006 show. In 2007, [[Zenith Electronics]], owned by [[LG Group|LG]], came up with 8VSB, which was introduced with [[Harris Corporation|Harris Group]]'s) [[MPH (ATSC)|Mobile-Pedestrian-Handheld (MPH)]] system.

As the broadcast networks began making their content available online, mobile DTV meant stations would have to find another way to compete. [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] tested A-VSB in the fall of 2006. Their stations [[KVCW]] and [[KSNV|KVMY]] were participating in the mobile DTV [[product demonstration|products demonstrations]] at the NAB show. A-VSB had worked in [[bus]]es at the 2007 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].

[[ION Media Networks]] started a test station on channel 38, which was to be used for digital [[LPTV]], which used a [[single-frequency network|single-frequency network (SFN)]]. In some areas, more than one [[TV transmitter]] would be needed to cover all areas. Mobile DTV could have been used at that time because it would not affect [[HDTV]] reception. A single standard, however, had to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/108538-NAB_Mobile_DTV_Hits_the_Strip.php|title=NAB: Mobile DTV Hits the Strip|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2007-04-14 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2009, the first [[prototype]] devices from LG and other manufacturers were demonstrated, including receivers for cars from [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]], [[Visteon]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]]. It was announced that 63 stations in 22 markets would debut the service in 2009. [[Gannett Broadcasting]] president David Lougee pointed out that many of those attending the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] would likely hear him but not see him; had the new technology been in place, this would not have been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/161893-CES_Broadcasters_Mobile_DTV_Moment.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=broadcasters+mobile+dtv+moment|title=CES: Broadcasters' Mobile DTV Moment|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-01-11 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the [[Open Mobile Video Coalition]], made up of over 800 broadcast stations, selected four test stations: Gannett's [[WATL (TV)|WATL]], ION's [[WPXA-TV]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Fisher Communications|Fisher Communications']] [[KOMO-TV]], and [[Belo]]'s [[KONG-TV]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. WPXA had begun mobile DTV broadcasting on April 1. The others would begin in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/209447-NAB_2009_Broadcasters_Set_Mobile_DTV_Test_Markets.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=broadcasters+set+mobile+dtv+test+markets|title=NAB 2009: Broadcasters Set Mobile DTV Test Markets|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-04-20 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2009, ION said HDTV, [[Digital terrestrial television|standard definition]] and mobile DTV streams were now available using its affiliates in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The "triple-play" concept was part of an effort to create a mobile DTV standard. At the time, only those with prototype receivers could pick up the streams.

ION chairman and CEO Brandon Burgess said mobile DTV lets stations "think beyond the living room and bring live television and real time information to consumers wherever they may be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307120-ION_Broadcasts_Mobile_DTV_in_N_Y_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION Broadcasts Mobile DTV in N.Y., D.C.: Hails Its Digital TV "Triple Play"|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-06-29 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Advanced Television Systems Committee started work on mobile DTV standards in May 2007, and manufacturers and sellers worked quickly to make the new technology a reality. The [[OMVC]] persuaded LG and Samsung to work together starting in May 2008 so that differing systems (possibly a self-destructing format war) would not delay or kill the technology.

Early in July 2009, the ATSC Technology and Standards Group approved the [[ATSC-M/H]] standard for mobile DTV which all members green-lighted October 15. The public could be using the new devices by 2010, though watching TV on [[cell phone]]s seemed unlikely in the near future since telephone manufacturers did not yet include that capability. The technology was expected to be used for [[Opinion poll]]s and even voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307463-Mobile_DTV_is_Almost_Official.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv |title=ATSC-M/H voted to proposed standard status |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-06 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=october&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358341-Mobile_DTV_Standard_Approved.php?rssid=20292&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Mobile DTV Standard Approved|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the ATSC and the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] began identifying products meeting the standard with "MDTV".&lt;ref name=mdtv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/440764-ATSC_Launches_Certification_Program_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20102&amp;q=digital+tv

Paul Karpowicz, NAB Television Board chairman and president of Meredith Broadcast Group, said &lt;blockquote&gt;"This milestone ushers in the new era of digital television broadcasting, giving local TV stations and networks new opportunities to reach viewers on the go. This will introduce the power of local broadcasting to a new generation of viewers and provide all-important emergency alert, local news and other programming to consumers across the nation."&lt;ref name=october/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in July, the first multi-station tests began in [[Washington, D.C.]], while single stations in [[New York (city)|New York City]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] already offered mobile DTV. The OMVC chose Atlanta's WATL and Seattle's KONG as "model stations" where product testing could take place. Seventy stations in 28 [[media market]]s planned streams by the end of 2009. All of the stations would have two or more channels each, with "[[electronic program guide|electronic service guide]] and alert data" among the services.

Twenty sellers of equipment would use these stations to test using the existing standard, but testing the final standard would come later, and tests by the public would happen in 2010, when many more devices would be ready.  Manufacturing large numbers of the devices could not take place without the final standard. LG, however, began mass-producing chips in June. ION technology vice president Brett Jenkins said, "We're really at a stage like the initial launch of DTV back in 1998. There are almost going to be more transmitters transmitting mobile than receive devices on the market, and that's probably what you'll see for the next six to nine months."&lt;ref name=Special/&gt;

Devices would eventually include [[USB]] dongles, [[netbook]]s, [[Portable DVD Player|portable DVD players]] and in-car displays.&lt;ref name=Special&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/314792-Special_Report_Mobile_DTV_Heats_Up.php |title=Special Report: Mobile DTV Heats Up |last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-13 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House officials and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] saw the triple-play concept in an ION demonstration on July 28, 2009 in conjunction with the OMVC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/316065-ION_OMVC_Organize_DTV_Showcase_in_D_C_.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=ION, OMVC Organize DTV Showcase in D.C.|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-07-22 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/326796-LIN_TV_Develops_Blackberry_App_For_Mobile_TV_Service.php?q=digital+tv |title=LIN TV Develops Blackberry App For Mobile TV Service|last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-08-07 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another demonstration took place October 16, 2009 with journalists, industry executives and broadcasters riding around Washington, D.C. in a bus with prototype devices. Included were those who would be testing the devices in the Washington and Baltimore markets in January 2010.&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/358415-OMVC_Does_Mobile_DTV_Tour.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv |title=OMVC Does Mobile DTV Tour |last=Eggerton |first=John |date=2009-10-16 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
{{primary sources|date=August 2015}}
{{overly detailed|section|date=April 2014}}
On August 7, 2009, [[BlackBerry]] service began on six TV stations. Eventually 27 other stations are expected to offer the service. By October, 30 stations were airing mobile DTV signals, and that number is expected to grow to 50. Also in the same month, FCC chair Julius Genachowski announced an effort to increase the spectrum available to wireless services.&lt;ref name=october/&gt;
Also in August, [[WTVE]] and [[Axcera]] began testing a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) with multiple transmitters using the new mobile standard. The [[WRNN-TV|RNN]] affiliate in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] had used this concept since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/441031-WTVE_Tests_SFN_For_Mobile_DTV.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=WTVE Tests SFN For Mobile DTV|last=Dickson |first=Glen |date=2009-12-18 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz &amp; Associates says VHF will not work as well for mobile DTV because a 15-inch antenna or some other solution would be required, although he has heard from people who had no problems. An amplified antenna or higher power for the transmitting station would likely be needed, as well as [[Broadcast relay station|repeater stations]] where terrain is a problem.&lt;ref name=Jessell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/articles/2009/09/24/daily.2/ |title=Digital VHF Needs A Power Boost |last=Jessell|first=Harry A.|work=TVNewsCheck|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lougee, whose company planned testing in its 19 markets in 2010, said the [[Computer chip|chip]] designs with the new devices made [[targeted advertising]] possible.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

In December 2009, Concept Enterprises introduced the first mobile DTV tuner for automobiles. Unlike earlier units, this one provides a clear picture without pixelation in a fast-moving vehicle, using an LG M/H chip and a one-inch roof-mounted antenna. No subscription is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php/|title=First Mobile DTV Car Tuner At $499|last=Gilroy|first=Amy|work=[[Twice (magazine)|TWICE]]|date=2009-11-09|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112153057/http://www.twice.com/article/388144-First_Mobile_DTV_Car_Tuner_At_499.php|archivedate=2009-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in December, the [[Consumer Electronics Association]] hosted a "plugfest" in Washington, D.C. to allow manufacturers to test various devices. More than 15 companies, and engineers from different countries, tested four transmission systems, 12 receiver systems, and four software types.&lt;ref name=mdtv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/394993-Mobile_DTV_Picks_Up_Speed.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv

On December 1, [[News Corp.]] chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]] said mobile DTV would be important to the future of all journalism, and he planned to offer TV and possibly [[newspaper]] content in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/391233-Murdoch_Says_Mobile_TV_Is_Key_to_Future.php?rssid=20070&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Murdoch Says Mobile TV Is Key to Future|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=2009-12-01|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the January 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, NAB head [[Gordon H. Smith]] disputed the idea that broadcasting's days were numbered, calling mobile DTV the proof over-the-air television would continue its popularity. He said people would use cell phones and other devices to watch, and broadcast technology would be the best way to do this. [[Wireless broadband]], which some wanted to replace broadcasting, would not be able to handle the demand for video services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/442953-CES_2010_Broadcasters_Tout_Mobile_DTV_Progress.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=CES 2010: Broadcasters Tout Mobile DTV Progress

He also explained to the FCC that mobile DTV was the best method for sending out live video to those using cell phones and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/444575-FCC_s_Bellaria_Says_Broadcasters_Lobbying_Against_Scenario_That_s_No_Longer_On_Table.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv

The [[OMVC]]'s Mobile DTV Consumer Showcase began May 3, 2010, and lasted all summer. Nine stations planned to distribute 20 programs, including local and network shows as well as cable programs, to [[Samsung Moment]] phones. [[Dell Netbooks]] and Valups Tivits also received programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobile DTV's Real-World Test|first=Glen|last=Dickson|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2010, Media General began its first MDTV service at [[WCMH-TV]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and had plans to do the same a month later at [[WFLA-TV]] in the [[Tampa Bay|Tampa Bay, Florida]] area and five to seven more stations in its portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/458539-Media_General_Expands_MDTV_Services.php|title=Media General Expands MDTV Services|first=George|last=Winslow|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2010-10-18|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2010, a joint venture of 12 major broadcasters known as the [[Mobile Content Venture|Mobile Content Venture (MCV)]] announced plans to upgrade TV stations in 20 markets representing 40 percent of the United States population to deliver live video to portable devices by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/eng/omvc-welcomes-mobile-content-venture-plans-upgrade-stations-mobile-video-delivery-20101124/|title=OMVC welcomes Mobile Content Venture plans to upgrade stations for mobile video delivery|last=Kurz|first=Phil|work=[[Broadcast Engineering]]|date=2010-11-22|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lawlor, a [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps TV]] senior vice president said that in September 2011, Scripps stations would offer an [[Mobile apps|mobile app]] allowing people with an [[iPhone]] or [[iPad]] to see emergency information (e.g. weather bulletins) in the event of a power outage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/473636-Broadcaster_of_the_Year_Brian_Lawlor.php |title=Broadcaster of the Year: Brian Lawlor |last=Malone |first=Michael |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a number of stations plan to conduct tests of the Mobile Emergency Alert System (M-EAS), a system to deliver emergency information via mobile DTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/480143-PBS_Stations_on_the_Alert_for_Emergency_Systems.php|title=PBS Stations on the Alert For Emergency Systems |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-02-06|accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the MCV announced that [[MetroPCS]] would offer MCV's Dyle mobile DTV service. [[Samsung]] planned an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone capable of receiving this service late in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/478677-Tech_You_Need_to_See.php |title=Tech You Need to See |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, Dyle was in 35 markets and capable of reaching 55 percent of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/491167-Mobilizing_the_TV_Business_Remains_a_Challenge.php|title=Mobilizing the TV Business Remains a Challenge |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the home page on its website, "As of May 22, 2015, Dyle® mobile TV is no longer in service, and Dyle-enabled devices and their apps will no longer be supported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dyle.tv|title=Dyle TV|website=Dyle.tv|accessdate=14 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113823/http://www.dyle.tv/|archivedate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the NAB show in April 2012, MCV announced that 17 additional television stations would launch mobile DTV, bringing the total to 92, covering more than 55% of US homes. Included are stations in three new markets: [[Austin, Texas]], [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], and [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/483472-Mobilizing_for_Mobile_DTV.php |title=Mobilizing for Mobile DTV |last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, [[WRAL-TV]] announced rollout of a [[Mobile Emergency Alert System]] based around mobile digital television technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0086/wral-tv-to-demo-mobile-eas/215408 TVTechnology: WRAL-TV to Demo Mobile EAS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A OTT technology platform called [[Syncbak]] enables smart phones and tablets rather than TV spectrum. Syncbak has been deployed across the United States at 55 major station groups, including FOX and CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syncbak Makes Its Case for Mobile|last=Winslow |first=George |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 2013, 130 stations were providing content, but adoption of devices such as [[dongle]]s was not widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/broadcasters-worry-zero-tv-homes-154357101--finance.html|title=Broadcasters worry about 'Zero TV' homes|last=Nakashima|first=Ryan|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2013-04-07|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional pay TV operators and broadcast networks still dominate the consumer television landscape, new options are emerging, from subscription video on demand (SVOD), to electronic sell-through (EST), to free TV streaming. While SVOD drives the most online TV streams by far, the incidence of consumers who used SVOD and free streaming in 2012 was relatively equal. According to NPD’s “Free Streaming TV” report, released in February 2013, 12 percent of United States TV watchers reported streaming TV shows for free during the prior three months, compared to 14 percent who watched a TV show via SVOD.&lt;ref&gt;Free Streaming Making Inroads with Traditional Television Consumers from The [[NPD Group]]: https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/the-npd-group-free-streaming-making-inroads-with-traditional-television-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;

"Over half of the viewers for streaming TV are between the ages of 18 and 34, so the YouTube generation is evolving from short-form and user-generated content to TV shows and, like YouTube, they can watch where and when they want," said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of industry analysis at NPD. "Despite the attention lavished on tablets and phones, an astonishing 83 percent of free TV streaming programs are viewed on a computer."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1547">The '''Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative''' or '''Northwest Straits Initiative''' ('''NWSI''') was established under Title IV of Public Law 105–384 in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;105th Congress. (1998, November 13). Title IV. Public Law 105-384, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of the [[Northwest Straits Commission]], the [[Marine Resources Committees]], and the [[Northwest Straits Foundation]].

The NWSI was born from political deadlock over the proposed formation of a federal marine sanctuary in the waters of northwest Washington, including Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan Islands. Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Congressman Jack Metcalf proposed the Initiative as an alternative to the marine sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;"Giving locals a chance." Island Times 21 July 1999: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Its base operations are  federally-funded.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Colleen. "Save Our Aquatic Ecosystem - Practice Marine Stewardship." The Islands' Weekly 18 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWSI focuses on conservation and restoration of [[Puget Sound]] in northwest Washington State and relies on the work of local, citizen-based Marine Resources Committees (located in seven counties) to prioritize actions in recovering the health of the sound.&lt;ref&gt;Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team. "New Initiative Tackles 'Tough Problems' to Protect, Restore Marine Resources." Sound Waves 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The seven Washington State counties are: Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam.

The '''Nuclear Physics Institute of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]]''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Ústav Jaderné Fyziky Akademie věd ČR'') is a public research institution located in [[Řež]], [[Central Bohemian Region]], [[Czech Republic]]. It was established in 1972 from the Physics Section of the former institute of Nuclear Research of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.cz/index.html The Czech Academy of Sciences official website], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1955 the Nuclear Research Institute CSAS (originally called the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences) was founded as a basic institution for nuclear research. As the nuclear power industry developed in the Czech Republic, the institute was in 1972 divided into several parts. The largest part was subsided to the Czechoslovak Commission for Atomic Energy under the name Nuclear Research Institute and later privatized. The second largest part the Nuclear Physics Institute of the CAS remains under the Academy of Sciences.  Former Institute of Radiation Dosimetry CAS in [[Prague]] was connected to NPI as a detached branch in 1994.

== Research ==

Primary focus of the institute is [[nuclear physics]], both theoretical and experimental. It carries out studies in the nuclear [[spectroscopy]] of [[Beta radiation|beta]] and [[gamma radiation]], nuclear reactions including the collisions of heavy [[ions]] and hyper-nuclear physics. Its work is also focused on related fields, such as the study of the solid phase using [[neutron scattering]], mathematical physics and theoretical subnuclear physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accs.ujf.cas.cz/ Nuclear Physics Institute of the CAS official website], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Isochronous cyclotron U-120M ==

Isochronous cyclotron U-120M is the primary experimental facility of the institute and it is the only [[cyclotron]] in the Czech Republic. It has been operating since 1977. The cyclotron is used both for fundamental research and applications. It can accelerate ions within the range of the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] A/q = 1 - 2.8. The present internal radial ion source is suitable for acceleration of H^+, D^+, 4-He^+2 and 3-He^+2. Maximum [[proton]] energy is 36 MeV, and the maximum energy for heavier ions is given by 40 q^2/A MeV. Currents of an internal beam of protons and [[deuterons]] can reach 100 microA, and for extracted beams 5 microA. Particles are extracted from the cyclotron chamber by means of a 3-section deflection electrostatic system to the entrance of the beam lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mx.ujf.cas.cz/institute/expr1.html Isochronous cyclotron U-120M], Retrieved November 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parasitic plant''' is a [[plant]] that derives some or all of its nutritional requirement from another living plant. They make up about 1% of [[angiosperms]] and are in almost every [[biome]] in the world. All parasitic plants have modified roots, named haustoria (singular: [[haustorium]]), which penetrates the host plants, connecting them to the conductive system – either the [[xylem]], the [[phloem]], or both. This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. [[Parasite|Parasitic]] plants are classified depending on where the parasitic plant latches onto the host and the amount of nutrients it requires.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/lib/washington/reader.action?docID=593748 |author=Heide-Jørgensen, Henning S. |year=2008 |title=Parasitic flowering plants |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-9004167506}}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parasitic plants are able to locate their [[host (biology)|host]] plants by detecting [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] in the air or soil given off by host [[shoot]]s or [[root]]s, respectively. About 4,500 [[species]] of parasitic plant in approximately 20 families of [[flowering plant]]s are known.&lt;ref&gt;Nickrent, D. L. and Musselman, L. J. 2004. Introduction to Parasitic Flowering Plants. ''The Plant Health Instructor''. {{doi|10.1094/PHI-I-2004-0330-01}} [http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/pathogengroups/pages/parasiticplants.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;

== Classification ==
Parasitic plants are characterized as follows:&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;&lt;!--pages needed--&gt;

*1a. [[Obligate parasite]] – a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without a host.
*1b. [[Facultative parasite]] – a parasite that can complete its life cycle independent of a host.
*2a. Stem parasite – a parasite that attaches to the host stem.
*2b. Root parasite – a parasite that attaches to the host root.
*3a. Hemiparasite – a plant parasitic under natural conditions, but [[photosynthetic]] to some degree. Hemiparasites may just obtain water and mineral nutrients from the host plant; many obtain at least part of their organic nutrients from the host as well.
*3b. Holoparasite - a parasitic plant that derives all of its fixed carbon from the host plant. Commonly lacking chlorophyll, holoparasites are often colors other than green.

[[File:Mistletoe, coming soon to a market near you - geograph.org.uk - 1585249.jpg|thumb|[[Mistletoe]], an obligate stem hemiparasite]]

For hemiparasites, one from each of the three sets of terms can be applied to the same species, e.g. 
*''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'' (Western Australian Christmas tree) is an obligate root hemiparasite.
*''[[Rhinanthus]]'' (e.g. [[Yellow rattle]]) is a facultative root hemiparasite.
*[[Mistletoe]] is an obligate stem hemiparasite.

Holoparasites are always obligate so only two terms are needed, e.g. 
*[[Cuscuta europaea|Dodder]] is a stem holoparasite.
*''[[Hydnora]]'' spp. are root holoparasites.

Plants usually considered holoparasites include [[Orobanche|broomrape]], [[Cuscuta|dodder]], ''[[Rafflesia]]'', and the [[Hydnoraceae]].  Plants usually considered hemiparasites include ''[[Castilleja]]'', [[mistletoe]], [[Western Australian Christmas tree]], and [[yellow rattle]].

==Evolution of parasitic behavior==
[[File:Striga root connections.jpg|thumb|''[[Striga]]'' witchweeds (white, centre, attached to roots of host) are economically important pests of the crop plants that they parasitise.]]

Parasitic behavior evolved in angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, a classic example of convergent evolution. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' (encompassing the genera ''Tryphysaria'', ''[[Striga]]'', and ''[[Orobanche]]'') is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of [[parasitism]]. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or holoparasites.&lt;ref name=Westwood&gt;Westwood, James H., John I. Yoder, Michael P. Timko and Claude W. Depamphilis. "The Evolution of Parasitism in Plants." ''Trends in Plant Science'' 15.4 (2010) 227-35. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary event which gave rise to parasitism in plants was the development of haustoria. The first, most ancestral, haustoria are thought to be similar to that of the facultative hemiparasites within ''Tryphysaria'', lateral haustoria develop along the surface of the roots in these species. Later evolution led to the development of terminal or primary haustoria at the tip of the juvenile [[radicle]], seen in obligate hemiparasitic species within ''[[Striga]]''. Lastly, obligate holoparasitic behavior originated with the loss of the photosynthetic process, seen in the genus ''[[Orobanche]]''.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

To maximize resources, many parasitic plants have evolved '''self-incompatibility''', to avoid parasitizing themselves. Others such as ''[[Triphysaria]]'' usually avoid parasitizing other members of their species, but some parasitic plants have no such limits.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt; The [[albino redwood]] is a mutant ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'' that produces no chlorophyll; they live on sugars from neighbouring trees, usually the parent tree from which they have grown (via a somatic mutation).&lt;ref name = "Stienstra"&gt;{{cite news |last = Stienstra | first = T. | title = It's no snow job - handful of redwoods are rare albinos | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = 11 October 2007 |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/11/SPK4SI0PM.DTL |accessdate = December 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Krieger"&gt;{{cite web | last = Krieger | first = L.

==Seed germination==

Parasitic plants [[Germination|germinate]] in a variety of ways. These means can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most parasitic plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited due in part to the fact that most parasitic plants are not able to use [[autotrophic]] nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott, P. 2008. Physiology and behavior of plants: parasitic plants. John Wiley &amp; sons pp. 103–112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon&gt;Runyon, J. Tooker, J. Mescher, M. De Moraes, C.  2009.  Parasitic plants in agriculture: Chemical ecology of germination and host-plant location as targets for sustainable control: A review. Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 1. pp. 123-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Root parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination. In order for germination to occur, seeds need to be fairly close to their host plant.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt; For example, the seeds of witchweed (''[[Striga asiatica]]'') need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) of its host in order to pick up chemical signals in the soil to signal germination.  This range is important because ''Striga asiatica'' will only grow about 4&amp;nbsp;mm after germination.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;  Chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host’s [[root|root system]] into the surrounding soil.  These chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them. Parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough. These compounds are called [[strigolactone]]s. Strigolactone stimulates [[Ethylene (plant hormone)|ethylene biosynthesis]] in seeds causing them to germinate.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;

There are a variety of chemical germination stimulants. [[Strigol]] was the first of the germination stimulants to be isolated.  It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets.   The stimulants are usually plant specific, examples of other germination stimulants include [[sorgolactone]] from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and [[5-deoxystrigol]] from ''Lotus japonicas''. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneeweiss, G. 2007.  Correlated evolution of life history and host range  in the  nonphotosynthetic parasitic flowering plants Orobanche and Phelipanche (Orobanchaceae). Journal Compilation. European  Society for Evolutionary Biology. 20 471-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stem parasitic plants, unlike most root parasites, germinate using the resources inside their endosperms and are able to survive for some time. For example, [[Cuscuta|the dodders (''Cuscuta'' spp.)]] drop their seeds to the ground; these may remain [[dormancy|dormant]] for up to five years before they find a host plant nearby. Using the resources in the seed [[endosperm]], dodder is able to germinate. Once germinated, the plant has 6 days to find and establish a connection with its host plant before its resources run out.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; Dodder seeds germinate above ground and then the plant sends out stems in search of its host plant reaching up to 6&amp;nbsp;cm before it dies. It is believed that the plant uses two methods of finding a host.  The stem detects its host plant's scent and orients itself in that direction. Scientists used volatiles from [[tomato]] plants ([[α-pinene]], [[β-myrcene]], and [[phellandrene|β-phellandrene]]) to test the reaction of C. ''pentagona'' and found that the stem orients itself in the direction of the odor.&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;  Some studies suggest that by using light reflecting from nearby plants dodders are able to select host with higher sugar because of the levels of [[chlorophyll]] in the leaves.&lt;ref name=Lesica&gt;Lesica, P. 2010. Dodder: Hardly Doddering. Kelseya Newsletter of Montana Native Plant Society. Vol 23. 2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Once the dodder finds its host, it wraps itself around the host plants stem.  Using adventitious roots, the dodder taps into the host plant's stem with a [[haustorium]], an absorptive organ within the host plant [[vascular tissue]]. Dodder makes several of these connections with the host as it moves up the plant.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runyon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lesica/&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

There are several methods of seed dispersal, but all the strategies aim to put the seed in direct contact with, or within a critical distance of, the host.

# The [[Cuscuta|Cuscuta seedling]] can live for 3–7 weeks and extend out 35&amp;nbsp;cm in search of the host before it dies. This is because the Cuscuta seed is large and has stored nutrients to sustain its life. This is also useful for seeds that get digested by animals and excreted out.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# [[Mistletoe]] use a sticky seed for dispersal. The seed sticks to nearby animals and birds and then comes into direct contact with the host.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# [[Arceuthobium]] seeds have a similarly sticky seed as the mistletoe but they do not rely on animals and birds, they mainly disperse by fruit [[Explosion|explosiveness]]. Once the seed makes contact with the host rain water can help position the seed into a suitable position.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;
# Some seeds detect and respond to [[Chemical substance|chemical stimulations]] produced in the host’s roots and start to grow towards the host.&lt;ref name="Heide-Jørgensen2008"/&gt;

== Obstacles of attaching to a host ==
The parasitic plant has many obstacles to overcome in order to attach to the host. Distance from the host and stored nutrients are only some of the problems, the host's defenses are an obstacle to overcome itself. The first hurdle is penetrating the host, the host has systems to reinforce the cell wall by [[Cross-link|protein cross-linking]] so that it stops the parasitic progress at the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the host's roots. The second hurdle is the host's ability to [[Secretion|secrete]] germination inhibitors. This prevents [[germination]] of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is the host's ability to create a [[Toxicity|toxic]] environment for where the parasitic plant attaches to. The host secretes [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds into the [[apoplast]] the creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is the host's ability to ruin the [[tubercle]] using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the [[tubercle]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters, D. (2010). Plant Defense Warding off attack by pathogens, herbivores and parasitic plants. Hoboken: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host range==
Some parasitic plants are generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (''[[Cassytha]]'' spp., ''[[Cuscuta]]'' spp.) and red rattle (''[[Odontites vernus]]'') are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few or even just one species. Beech drops (''[[Epifagus virginiana]]'') is a root holoparasite only on American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''). ''[[Rafflesia]]'' is a holoparasite on the vine ''Tetrastigma''. Plants such as ''[[Pterospora]]'' become parasites of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of ''Tryphysaria'' experience reduced haustorium development in the presence of other ''Tryphysaria''. Although, the mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

==Aquatic parasitic plants==
Parasitism also evolved within aquatic species of plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are described as [[benthos|benthic]], meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] ([[lithophyte|epilithic]] is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant in some way or another. In contrast, [[endophyte|endophytic]] plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate holoparasites to facultative hemiparasites.&lt;ref name=Dring&gt;Dring, M. J. ''The Biology of Marine Plants''. London: E. Arnold, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine parasites occur as a higher proportion of marine flora in temperate rather than tropical waters. While no full explanation for this is available, many of the potential host plants such as [[kelp]] and other macroscopic [[brown algae]] are generally restricted to temperate areas. Roughly 75% of parasitic [[red algae]] infect hosts in the same taxonomic family as themselves, these are given the designation adelphoparasites. Other marine parasites, deemed endozoic, are parasites of marine invertebrates ([[mollusca|molluscs]], [[flatworm]]s, [[sponge]]s) and can be either holoparasitic or hemiparasitic, some retaining the ability to photosynthesize after infection.&lt;ref name=Dring/&gt;

==Importance==
Species within ''[[Orobanchaceae]]'' are some of the most economically destructive species on Earth. Species of ''[[Striga]]'' alone are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. ''[[Striga]]'' can infest both grasses and grains, including [[Zea mays|corn]], [[Oryza sativa|rice]] and [[Sorghum]], undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. ''[[Orobanche]]'' also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, [[Cicer arietinum|chickpeas]], [[Solanum lycopersicum|tomatoes]], [[carrot]]s, and varieties of the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' (e.g. cabbage, lettuce, and broccoli). Yield loss from ''[[Orobanche]]'' can reach 100% and has caused farmers in some regions of the world to abandon certain staple crops and begin importing others as an alternative. Much research has been devoted to the control of ''Orobanche'' and ''Striga'' species, which are even more devastating in developing areas of the world, though no method has been found to be entirely successful.&lt;ref name=Westwood/&gt;

*Mistletoes cause economic damage to forest and ornamental trees.
*''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]'' produces the world's largest flowers at about one meter in diameter. It is a tourist attraction in its native habitat.
*[[Sandalwood]] trees (''Santalum'' species) have many important cultural uses and their fragrant oils have high commercial value.
*Indian paintbrush (''[[Castilleja|Castilleja linariaefolia]]'') is the state flower of Wyoming.
*The Oak Mistletoe (''[[Phoradendron|Phoradendron serotinum]]'') is the floral emblem of Oklahoma.
*A few other parasitic plants are occasionally cultivated for their attractive flowers, such as ''Nutysia'' and broomrape.
*Parasitic plants are important in research, especially on the loss of photosynthesis during evolution.
*A few dozen parasitic plants have occasionally been used as food by people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parasiticplants.siu.edu/ParasiteFood.html Parasitic Angiosperms Used for Food?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Western Australian Christmas tree (''[[Nuytsia floribunda]]'') sometimes damages underground cables. It mistakes the cables for host roots and tries to parasitize them using its sclerenchymatic guillotine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~b_morpho/nuytsia_backenzahn.html Sclerenchymatic guillotine in the haustorium of Nuytsia floribunda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060726050051/http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~b_morpho/nuytsia_backenzahn.html |date=2006-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some parasitic plants are destructive while some have positive influences in their [[Community|communities]]. Some parasitic plants damage [[invasive species]] more than [[native species]]. This results in the reduced damage of [[invasive species]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034577 Li J, Jin Z, Song W (2012) Do Native Parasitic Plants Cause More Damage to Exotic Invasive Hosts Than Native Non-Invasive Hosts?

==Plants parasitic on fungi==
About 400 species of flowering plants, plus one [[gymnosperm]] (''[[Parasitaxus|Parasitaxus usta]]''), are parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi. This effectively gives these plants the ability to become associated with many of the other plants around them. They are termed [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophs]].  Some myco-heterotrophs are Indian pipe (''[[Monotropa uniflora]]''), snow plant (''[[Sarcodes|Sarcodes sanguinea]]''), underground orchid (''[[Rhizanthella gardneri]]''), bird's nest orchid (''[[Neottia nidus-avis]]''), and sugarstick (''[[Allotropa virgata]]''). Within the taxonomic family ''[[Ericaceae]]'', known for extensive mycorrhizal relationships, there are the Monotropoids. The Monotropoids include the genera ''[[Monotropa]]'', ''[[Monotropsis]]'', and ''[[Pterospora]]'' among others. Myco-heterotrophic behavior is commonly accompanied by the loss of chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Judd, Walter S., Christopher Campbell, and Elizabeth A. Kellogg.

A '''party motivator''' is a person paid to entertain attendants at a party. Typically, party motivators are attractive young men and women who dress fashionably and attempt to engage guests in socializing and dancing. Hiring party motivators is primarily a phenomenon within the [[United States|American]] upper middle and upper classes; they are especially common at [[bar mitzvah]]s.

'''Practising Law Institute''' ('''PLI''') is a non-profit [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) organization chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York. Founded in 1933, the company organizes and provides CLE programs around the world. Its programs are held in multiple locations including New York, California, Illinois, Washington D.C., Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, London, and Hong Kong.

Programs are also offered in various formats, including live webcasts, MP3s, and on-demand videos. PLI's headquarters are located in New York City, New York; it also maintains an office in San Francisco, California.

==History==
Founded in 1933, PLI was established to offer courses in the practice of law for lawyers recently admitted to the bar and/or those seeking to learn the elements of practicing in the field. As the country was seeing a transition from apprenticeship to formal law school education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706002749/http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York City lawyer by the name of Harold Seligson recognized the need for practical training in law and originated a series of lectures called “Practising Law Courses.” These lectures would be the germination of the full-fledged Institute that exists today under the banner of the Practising Law Institute (PLI).

By 1939, the Institute had been formally chartered by the Regents of the State of New York. It was able to take advantage of certain historical forces, including the [[New Deal]] and the federal regulation of business activity it inspired. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], for example, initiated a new specialization in the law. This new specialization in turn created a need for a new kind of [[continuing legal education]], which we see in practice today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a not-for-profit educational organization, PLI continues to offer pro bono programs and scholarships to lawyers and student in need of assistance. In 2012, PLI awarded over 26,000 scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pli.edu/emktg/Annual_Report2012/AnnualReport2012.html|title=AnnualReport2012|work=pli.edu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27th, 2015 the PLI Board of Trustees formally installed Anita Carr Shapiro as its fifth president. She succeeded Victor J. Rubino who was unanimously approved as President Emeritus after serving as PLI's President since 1983. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/practising-law-institute-appoints-anita-carr-shapiro-as-president-and-victor-j-rubino-as-president-emeritus-300071956.html|title=Practising Law Institute Appoints Anita Carr Shapiro as President and Victor J.

==History==
[[File:JohnPurdue.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Purdue]], the University's eponymous benefactor]]

In 1865, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] voted to take advantage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862]], and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering. Communities throughout the state offered their facilities and money to bid for the location of the new college. Popular proposals included the addition of an agriculture department at [[Indiana State University]] or at what is now [[Butler University]]. By 1869, [[Tippecanoe County]]’s offer included $150,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1869|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist [[John Purdue]], $50,000 from the county, and {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} of land from local residents. On May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University, in the name of the principal benefactor. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.&lt;ref name="purdue.edu"/&gt; Professor [[John S.

[[Emerson E. White]], the university’s president from 1876 to 1883, followed a strict interpretation of the Morrill Act. Rather than emulate the classical universities, White believed Purdue should be an "industrial college" and devote its resources toward providing a [[liberal education|liberal]] (or broad) education with an emphasis on science, technology, and agriculture. He intended not only to prepare students for industrial work, but also to prepare them to be good citizens and family members.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 89–94, 97–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of White's plan to distinguish Purdue from classical universities included a controversial attempt to ban fraternities. This ban was ultimately overturned by the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] and led to White's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; The next president, [[James H. Smart]], is remembered for his call in 1894 to rebuild the original Heavilon Hall "one brick higher" after it had been destroyed by a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 134–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904 Panorama of campus, Purdue Univ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Purdue University, 1904]]
By the end of the nineteenth century, the university was organized into schools of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy, and former U.S. President [[Benjamin Harrison]] was serving on the board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive and a [[Corliss steam engine]], one of the most efficient engines of the time. The School of Agriculture was sharing its research with farmers throughout the state with its cooperative extension services and would undergo a period of growth over the following two decades. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine. By 1925 Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status it would keep for half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Edward C. Elliott]] oversaw a campus building program between the world wars. Inventor, alumnus, and trustee [[David E. Ross]] coordinated several fundraisers, donated lands to the university, and was instrumental in establishing the Purdue Research Foundation. Ross's gifts and fundraisers supported such projects as [[Ross–Ade Stadium]], the [[Purdue Memorial Union|Memorial Union]], a civil engineering surveying camp, and [[Purdue University Airport]]. Purdue Airport was the country's first university-owned airport and the site of the country's first college-credit flight training courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/05-0443westlafayette.pdf|title=Historic Aerospace Site: Purdue University Airport, West Lafayette, Indiana|author=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|year=2005|pages=2–3|format=PDF|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201224602/http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/05%2D0443westlafayette%2Epdf|archivedate=December 1, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Earhart]] joined the Purdue faculty in 1935 as a consultant for these flight courses and as a counselor on women's careers. In 1937, the Purdue Research Foundation provided the funds for the [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra 10-E]] Earhart flew on her attempted round-the-world flight.

Every school and department at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of [[germanium]] that led to the making of the first [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1941-semiconductor.html |title=1941 – Semiconductor diode rectifiers serve in WW II|year=2007|work=The Silicon Engine: A Timeline of Semiconductors in Computers|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/info/germanium.html|title=Germanium Comes of Age|year=1999|work=Transistorized!

Bill]], first-year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the [[Purdue University system]]. Purdue's on-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947, following pressure from Purdue President [[Frederick L. Hovde]] and Indiana Governor [[Ralph F. Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.lib.purdue.edu/orthefirenexttime|title=Or the Fire Next Time: A Timeline of African American History at Purdue|year=2010|author=Purdue Libraries, Archives and Special Collections|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514184827/http://collections.lib.purdue.edu/orthefirenexttime/|archivedate=May 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Hovde worked to expand the academic opportunities at the university. A decade-long construction program emphasized science and research. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the university established programs in veterinary medicine, industrial management, and nursing, as well as the first computer science department in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/history/history.html|title=History of the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University|first1=John R.|last1=Rice|first2=Saul|last2=Rosen|year=1994|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=November 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216124633/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/history/history.html|archive-date=December 16, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undergraduate humanities courses were strengthened, although Hovde only reluctantly approved of graduate-level study in these areas. Purdue awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The programs in liberal arts and education, formerly administered by the School of Science, were soon split into their own school.

The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university's centennial in 1969. Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially for 73 years, the current seal depicts a [[griffin]], symbolizing strength, and a three-part shield, representing education, research, and service.

In recent years, Purdue's leaders have continued to support high-tech research and international programs. In 1987, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] visited the West Lafayette campus to give a speech about the influence of technological progress on job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Hails U.S. Technology's Role|first=Gerald M.|last=Boyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/10/us/reagan-hails-us-technology-s-role.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1987|page=A12|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the university added more opportunities to study abroad and expanded its course offerings in world languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campus Life: Purdue; The Race Is On To Ready Students For Globalization|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/style/campus-life-purdue-the-race-is-on-to-ready-students-for-globalization.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 1990|page=47|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first buildings of the Discovery Park interdisciplinary research center were dedicated in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=12097|title=Purdue Dedicates Center For Entrepreneurship|date=October 21, 2004|work=Inside Indiana Business|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113133413/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=12097|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue launched a Global Policy Research Institute in 2010 to explore the potential impact of technical knowledge on public policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSF director to lead new Purdue research institute|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/11939770/nsf-director-to-lead-new-purdue-research-institute|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[WTHR]]|date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2017, Purdue University announced plans to acquire [[for-profit college]] [[Kaplan University]] and convert it to a public university in the state of Indiana, subject to multiple levels of approval.&lt;ref name="PurdueAnnounce20170427"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue to acquire Kaplan University, increase access for millions|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q2/purdue-to-acquire-kaplan-university,-increase-access-for-millions.html|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That school now operates as [[Purdue University Global]], and aims to serve adult learners.

==Campus==

Purdue's campus is situated in the small city of [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]], near the western bank of the [[Wabash River]], across which sits the larger city of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]]. State Street, which is concurrent with [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]], divides the northern and southern portions of campus. Academic buildings are mostly concentrated on the eastern and southern parts of campus, with residence halls and intramural fields to the west, and athletic facilities to the north. The [[Greater Lafayette Public Transportation Corporation]] (CityBus) operates eight campus loop bus routes on which students, faculty, and staff can ride free of charge with Purdue Identification.

===Purdue Mall===

The Purdue Mall is the central quad of Purdue University. Also known as the Purdue Spine, due to its proximity to several important academic buildings, it was created to connect the academic campus with Ross-Ade Stadium.  It is known as the Engineering Mall, due to its proximity to several engineering buildings. The most prominent feature of the Purdue Mall is the {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall concrete [[Engineering Fountain]], and also features the [[Frederick L. Hovde]] Hall of Administration, which houses the office of the university president, [[Mitchell E. Daniels]]. The [[Purdue Bell Tower]] is between the Stadium and Centennial Malls. The Bell Tower is considered an icon of the university and can be found on many Purdue logos and those of the cities of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]].

Southwest of the Stadium Mall is the [[Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music]], one of the largest [[proscenium|proscenium theaters]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/HallOfMusic/venues/elliott/elliott.html|title=Hall of Music Productions – Venues – Purdue University|publisher=Housing.purdue.edu|date=September 30, 1990|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's Student Concert Committee often invites famous entertainers to perform there for an audience of students, faculty, and the public.

===Memorial Mall===
[[File:Purdue Student Union.JPG|thumb|right|Purdue Memorial Union]]
[[File:Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-15, DD 33.jpg|thumb|Union Club.]]
The Purdue Memorial Mall, south of the Purdue Mall, is the original section of campus. A popular meeting place for students, the grassy, open Memorial Mall is surrounded by the Stewart Center, Wetherill Laboratory of Chemistry, Stanley Coulter Hall, the Class of 1950 Lecture Hall, the Recitation Building, University Hall, and Stone Hall. The Memorial Mall also features the Hello Walk. Near this section of campus is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who perished in the [[Purdue Wreck]] railroad accident on October 31, 1903. The structure was renovated in 1985 to house the Computer Science department. In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department. East of the Memorial Mall is the [[Purdue Memorial Union]], Purdue's [[student activity center|student union]] building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.

University Hall is the only building remaining from the original six-building campus. Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as "The Main Building". The building was dedicated in 1877 and the project cost $35,000 to complete. University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms, but was remodeled in 1961 to house only the department of history and classrooms used by the School of Liberal Arts. At the request of [[John Purdue]], he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. (2009).

===South Campus===
[[File:Purdue Hort Gardens.jpg|thumb|Horticulture Gardens]]
The area south of State Street is home to Purdue's agricultural, fine arts, life sciences, and veterinary buildings. This area also includes the Krannert School of Management, [[Purdue University Horticulture Gardens|Horticulture Gardens]], [[Discovery Park (Purdue)|Discovery Park]], Lyles Porter Hall and the [[Purdue University Airport|Purdue Airport]]. The Krannert School of management has been nationally and globally ranked for both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Krannert and Rawls Hall provide state of the art learning facilities to the majority of business classes on campus. Rawls Hall was built in 2006 with the help of a $10 million gift from Jerry S. Rawls, the largest in the management school's history. Lyles Porter Hall houses interdisciplinary healthcare facilities and classroom space within the College of Health and Human Sciences as well as the School of Medicine. Collectively, students and clinical faculty within Nursing, Health and Kinesiology, Nutrition Science, Psychological Sciences, and Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences see approximately 3,000 patients a year within this state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare facility. The building features a nursing clinic, specialized preschool, exercise center, consultation space and demonstration kitchen for dietitians in training, clinical psychology facility, audiology and speech-language pathology clinics, cadaver laboratory for physicians in training, and research laboratories. Purdue University Airport, which opened in 1930 was the first of its kind, and remains one of only a few university-owned airports in the nation. Including the Niswonger Aviation Technology Building, which was dedicated in 2009, the facility symbolizes Purdue's storied relationship with aviation.

===West Campus===
The western portion of campus consists of student housing, dining, and recreation facilities. Students can play club and [[intramural sports]] at the Córdova Recreational Sports Center, the Morgan J. Burke Aquatic Center (named for former Purdue Men's Swimming &amp; Diving Captain and longtime Vice President &amp; Athletics Director), and the intramural playing fields in this area. The Córdova Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs. As a replacement for the previously separate women's and men's gymnasiums, it was originally called the "Co-recreational Gymnasium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Debris |accessdate=2012-07-19 |type=yearbook |year=1958 |publisher=Purdue University |location=West Lafayette, Indiana |page=293 |chapter=Co-recreational Gym increases I-M activity |chapterurl=http://earchives.lib.purdue.edu/u?/debris,40537 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several expansions and official name changes, it has been nicknamed "the Co-rec" ever since.

===Stadium Avenue===

Much of the northern part of campus sits on land purchased for the university by industrialist David E. Ross and author and humorist [[George Ade]] in the 1920s. Many of Purdue's athletic facilities are there, including [[Ross–Ade Stadium]] ([[American football]]), [[Mackey Arena]] (basketball), and [[Lambert Fieldhouse]] (indoor track and field). This area also includes the [[Slayter Center of Performing Arts]] and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.&lt;ref name="housing.purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/Housing/Cary_Quadrangle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807152841/http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/Housing/Cary_Quadrangle/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-07|accessdate=2009-08-25|publisher=Purdue University Housing and Food Services|title=Cary Quadrangle}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ross is one of three people buried on Purdue's campus, the others being John Purdue and former First Lady of Purdue, Jane Beering. Ross's and Beering's grave sites are in a garden atop Slayter Hill just to west of the Slayter band shell. Beering's husband, former Purdue President [[Steven C. Beering|Steven Beering]], will eventually join her atop the hill.&lt;ref name="wthr.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/article/beering-burial-to-be-1st-on-purdue-campus-in-72-years|accessdate=2017-08-27|publisher=WTHR|title=Beering burial to be 1st on Purdue campus in 72 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baseball's [[Alexander Field (Purdue University)|Alexander Field]] and other athletic facilities are a mile west of the stadium, at the newer Northwest Athletic Complex.

Purdue offers both [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] programs in over 211 [[academic major|major]] areas of study, and is well known for its competitive engineering curricula. The university has also been highly influential in America's [[aviation history|history of aviation]], having established the first [[credit (education)|college credit]] offered in [[flight training]], the first four-year bachelor's degree in aviation, and the first university airport ([[Purdue University Airport]]). Purdue's aviation technology and aeronautical engineering programs remain among the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world. In the mid-20th century, Purdue's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced [[spaceflight]] technology giving rise to Purdue's nickname, ''Cradle of Astronauts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.purdue.edu/UNS/astro/astromain.html|title=Purdue Astronauts|publisher=Purdue University News Service |accessdate=2006-06-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216032631/http://www.purdue.edu/UNS/astro/astromain.html|archivedate=December 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three Purdue graduates have gone on to become astronauts, including [[Gus Grissom]] (one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts), [[Neil Armstrong]] (the first person to walk on the moon), and [[Eugene Cernan]] (the last person to walk on the moon).

In addition to its strong engineering and science programs, the English Department at Purdue has achieved prominence for having created the first [[Online Writing Lab]] (OWL) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/owlprint/608/|title=Purdue OWL|work=purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many colleges and universities use the website for the Purdue OWL as a reference for the proper word usage, punctuation, grammar, and style in [[academic writing]].

Purdue is organized into ten colleges and schools. On July 1, 2010 the College of Health and Human Sciences was formed. The new college was created by combining existing academic units. These units include the School of Nursing, the School of Health Sciences, the College of Consumer and Family Sciences, and non-humanities majors from the College of Liberal Arts; namely psychology and hearing and speech pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.purdue.edu/about/about.html|title=Purdue College of Health and Human Sciences|publisher=Hhs.purdue.edu|date=July 1, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113171140/https://www.hhs.purdue.edu/about/about.html|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university also offers 19 master's degree programs offered exclusively online, including for subjects like aviation management, communication, computer science, construction management, education, economics, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.purdue.edu/online-programs/masters-degrees|title=Masters Degrees {{!}} Purdue University Online|website=online.purdue.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
The [[University President]], appointed by the [[Board of Trustees]], is the [[chief administrative officer]] of the university. The office of the president oversees admission and registration, student conduct and counseling, the administration and scheduling of classes and space, the administration of student athletics and organized extracurricular activities, the libraries, the appointment of the faculty and conditions of their employment, the appointment of all non-faculty employees and the conditions of employment, the general organization of the university, and the planning and administration of the university budget.

The Board of Trustees directly appoints other major officers of the university including a [[provost (education)|provost]], who serves as the chief academic officer for the university, a number of vice presidents with oversight over specific university operations, and the regional campus chancellors.

===Research===
The University expended $472.7 million in support of research system-wide in 2006–07, using funds received from the state and federal governments, industry, foundations, and individual donors. The faculty and more than 400 research laboratories put Purdue University among the leading research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue University – Facts Online – Research |url=https://www.purdue.edu/facts/research.html|accessdate=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue University is considered by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] to have "very high research activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=243780 |title=Carnegie Classifications: Purdue University–Main Campus |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue also was rated the nation's fourth best place to work in academia, according to rankings released in November 2007 by ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gawrylewski|first=Andrea|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/2007/11/1/67/1/|title=Purdue pushes forward |journal=The Scientist|date=November 1, 2007|volume=21|issue=11|page=67|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's researchers provide insight, knowledge, assistance, and solutions in many crucial areas.

Purdue's library system consists of fifteen locations throughout the campus, including an archives and special collections research center, an undergraduate library, and several subject-specific libraries. More than three million volumes, including one million electronic books, are held at these locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/AdditionalFact/Libraries.html Data Digest 2013-14: Libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501034922/http://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/AdditionalFact/Libraries.html |date=May 1, 2015 }}. Purdue University. Retrieved 2015-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; An administrative unit of [[Purdue University Libraries]], [[Purdue University Press]] has its roots in the 1960 founding of Purdue University Studies by President Frederick Hovde on a $12,000 grant from the Purdue Research Foundation. This was the result of a committee appointed by President Hovde after the Department of English lamented the lack of publishing venues in the humanities. Since the 1990s, the range of books published by the Press has grown to reflect the work from other colleges at Purdue University especially in the areas of agriculture, health, and engineering. Purdue University Press publishes print and ebook monograph series in a range of subject areas from literary and cultural studies to the study of the human-animal bond. In 1993 Purdue University Press was admitted to membership of the [[Association of American University Presses]]. Purdue University Press publishes around 25 books a year and 20 learned journals in print, in print &amp; online, and online only formats in collaboration with Purdue University Libraries.

Several campus-wide programs are planned by the Purdue Alumni Student Experience (part of the Alumni Association), [[Purdue Memorial Union|Purdue Student Union Board]], Purdue Student Government (PSG), or the Purdue Graduate Student Government (PGSG). PSG and PGSG are made up of representatives from each of the university's academic colleges and give recommendations to the faculty, administration, and sometimes to the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=WBAA |date=May 4, 2012 |title=Indiana Lifeline measure becomes law |url=http://wbaa.org/post/indiana-lifeline-measure-becomes-law |last=Smith |first=Brandon |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual campus events include Boiler Gold Rush, Purdue University Dance Marathon, Spring Fest, and Grand Prix. Boiler Gold Rush (BGR) is Purdue's new-student orientation program. BGR, which takes place before each fall semester, was formed to ease the transition to college for incoming students and to help them get acquainted with successful college life. Boiler Gold Rush activities include speaker presentations from various academic, cultural, safety and professional organizations on campus, campus tours led by Team Leaders, academic 'meet the schools' picnic and interest sessions, late night events at the Purdue Memorial Union, Recreational Sports Center and local stores, and a sports pep rally. Purdue University Dance Marathon (PUDM) is an 18-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping, dance marathon that takes place each fall in the Cordova Recreation center. Each year over 2,000 students participate and the event raises over $1,000,000 annually for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. PUDM is also one of the largest collegiate Dance Marathons in the country. Spring Fest is an annual carnival with entertaining exhibits from many academic departments. A highlight of the weekend is the Entomology Department's Bug Bowl, where the sport of [[cricket spitting]] was invented in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Science Daily |title=Purdue Bug Bowl Bigger, Buggier And Better |date=April 6, 1999 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/04/990406042743.htm |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovitt |first=Rob |newspaper=NBC News |title=Travel's silly season: rat racing, cricket spitting and mullet tossing, oh my |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/travel/travels-silly-season-rat-racing-cricket-spitting-mullet-tossing-oh-712573?franchiseSlug=todaytravelmain |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Purdue Grand Prix]], a 50-mile, 160-lap go-kart race is "The Greatest Spectacle in College Racing" and wraps up Gala Week each year.

{{Main|Purdue Boilermakers}}
[[File:Purdue Pete.svg|thumb|150px|[[Purdue Pete]]]]
On October 26, 1891, a newspaper in Crawfordsville, Indiana, called Purdue's football team the "Boiler Makers" when writing about their trouncing of [[Wabash College]]. Lafayette newspapers soon picked up the name, and in October 1892, The Purdue Exponent, Purdue's student newspaper, gave it the stamp of approval. In the early days of Purdue football, the team was called other names as well, including "haymakers," "railsplitters," "sluggers," and "cornfield sailors." This heritage is reflected in Purdue's current mascots: the [[Boilermaker Special]] (a truck-like vehicle that resembles a locomotive) and [[Purdue Pete]] (a muscular hammer-wielding [[boilermaker]]). The school colors of [[old gold]] and black were selected by Purdue's first football team in 1887 to resemble the orange and black of [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton's]] then-successful team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purduesports.cstv.com/trads/old-gold-black.html|title=Purdue Official Athletic Site|publisher=Purduesports.cstv.com|accessdate=2010-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219185706/http://purduesports.cstv.com/trads/old-gold-black.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known fight song is "[[Hail Purdue!]]".

Purdue has one of the few college athletic programs not funded by student fees or subsidized by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/mens/basketball/article_11feca98-96f0-11e0-96f5-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Purdue athletics maintains stance on not paying athletes|publisher=Purdue Exponent|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b2.caspio.com/dp.asp?AppKey=900c1000ea466e223e104a22814a |title=CSM0810 Search and Report |publisher=B2.caspio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to 18 Division I/I-A [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] teams including football, basketball, cross country, tennis, wrestling, golf, volleyball, ice hockey ([[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]]), and others. Purdue is a founding member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and played a central role in its creation. Traditional rivals include Big Ten colleagues the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] (see [[Indiana–Purdue rivalry]]), the [[Illinois Fighting Illini]], and the [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] [[Fighting Irish]] from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (football program independent, however).

Purdue's baseball facility was named in honor of two alumni, [[Anna Margaret Ross Alexander]] and her husband, John Arthur Alexander, when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013.&lt;ref name="Purdue Sports (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexander Field Dedication Ceremony Set For Saturday Evening|url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/041713aaa.html |accessdate=10 April 2015|publisher=Purdue Sports|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football===

The [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Boilermaker football team]] represents Purdue University in the NCAA [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). [[Jeff Brohm]] is Purdue's current head coach, the 36th in the program's history. Purdue plays its home games at Ross-Ade Stadium on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The Boilermakers compete in the Big Ten Conference as a member of the West Division. With a 592–515–48 record, Purdue has the 49th most victories among NCAA FBS programs. Purdue was originally classified as a Major College school in the 1937 season until 1972. Purdue received Division I classification in 1973, becoming a Division I-A program from 1978 to 2006 and an FBS program from 2006 to the present. The Boilermakers have registered 64 winning seasons in their history, with 19 of those seasons resulting in eight victories or more, 10 seasons resulting in at least nine wins, and just one season with ten victories or more. Of those successful campaigns, Purdue has produced five unbeaten seasons in its history, going 4–0 in 1891, 8–0 in 1892, 8–0 in 1929, 7–0–1 in 1932 and 9–0 in 1943. The Boilermakers have won a total of 12 conference championships in their history, including four Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles and eight Big Ten Conference titles. The program is also notable for being one of only two universities – the other being the [[University of Alabama]] – to produce three [[Super Bowl]]-winning [[quarterback]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notre Dame, Stanford have most Super Bowl starts at QB|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000321044/article/notre-dame-stanford-have-most-super-bowl-starts-at-qb|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AL HAMNIK: Purdue QB greats love rocking that cradle|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/sports/college/article_de3e096c-bbdf-5964-b5c9-b506edf91b69.html|publisher=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found on a farm in southern [[Indiana]], the [[Old Oaken Bucket]] is one of the oldest football trophies in the nation. The winner of the annual Purdue vs. [[Indiana University]] [[American football]] game gets to add a bronze "P" or "I" chain link and keep the trophy until the next face-off. Ironically, the first competition in 1925 led to a 0–0 tie, resulting in the first link on the chain being an "IP." Purdue currently leads the trophy series at 57-27-3.

During "Breakfast Club", best described as a cross between a pep rally and a Halloween party, students and even some alumni dress up in costumes, from traditional Halloween garb to creative hand-made costumes, as they bar-hop before Boilermaker home football games.  The Breakfast Club plays a significant role during the football season and is informally a part of Purdue tradition.  Many Boilermaker fans are dedicated; getting up at 5&amp;nbsp;am on Saturdays and lining up at the bars on Chauncey Hill and the levee by 6&amp;nbsp;am. The Breakfast Club tradition also takes place the day of the annual [[Purdue Grand Prix]] race in April.

===Basketball===
The [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue Boilermakers basketball]] team competes in NCAA Division I and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. In 2005, [[Matt Painter]] became the head coach in West Lafayette. Painter took over the head coaching job from the winningest coach in school history, [[Gene Keady]], becoming the second former Boilermaker basketball player to take the lead role. Purdue basketball won its 23rd Big 10 Conference Championship in 2017. This mark leads the conference, as Indiana University is second with 22. The Boilermakers have reached two NCAA Tournament Final Fours and won a non-NCAA recognized National Championship for the 1932 season, awarded several years later by the Helms Athletic Foundation. It has sent more than 30 players to the NBA including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. Purdue shares a traditional rivalry with in-state foe [[Indiana University]], and holds a 112-88 series lead. The Boilermaker men's and women's basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships than any other conference school, with 27 conference titles. Purdue men's basketball has an all-time winning record against all Big Ten schools except Ohio State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Components can perform I/O operations on the ''boundary nodes'' of the circuit to which they are connected.
There are two kinds of I/O operations: put-requests dispatch data items to a node, and get-requests fetch data items from a node.
All I/O operations are blocking, which means that a component can proceed only after its pending I/O operation has been successfully processed.

The figure on the top-right shows an example of a producers-consumer system with three components: two producers on the left and one consumer on the right.
The circuit in the middle defines the protocol, which states that the producers should send data synchronously, while the consumer receives those data in alternating order.

Formally, the structure of a circuit is defined as follows:

'''Definition 1.''' A ''circuit'' is a triple &lt;math&gt;R = (N, B, C, t)&lt;/math&gt; where:
# {{mvar|N}} is a set of ''nodes'';
# &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq N&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''boundary nodes'';
# &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq 2^N \times 2^N&lt;/math&gt; is a set of ''channels'';
# &lt;math&gt;t : C \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; assigns a ''types'' to every channel.
such that &lt;math&gt;|I \cup O| = 2&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;(I,O) \in C&lt;/math&gt;.
If  &lt;math&gt;c = (I,O) \in C&lt;/math&gt; is a channel, then {{mvar|I}} is called the set of input nodes of {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|O}} is called the set of output nodes of  {{mvar|c}}.

The dynamics of a circuit resemble the flow of signals through an [[electronic circuit]].

Nodes have fixed merger-replicator behavior: the data of one of the incoming channels is propagated to all outgoing channels, without storing or altering the data (i.e., replicator behavior). If multiple incoming channels can provide data, the node makes a nondeterministic choice among them (i.e., merger behavior).
Nodes with only incoming or outgoing channels are called ''sink nodes'' or ''source nodes'', respectively; nodes with both incoming and outgoing channels are called ''mixed nodes''.

In contrast to nodes, channels have user-defined behavior represented by their type.
This means that channels may store or alter data items that flow through them.
Although every channel connects exactly two nodes, these nodes need not to be input and output.
For instance, the vertical channel in the figure on the top-right has two inputs and no outputs.
The channel type defines the behavior of the channel with respect to data.
Below is a list of common types:
* {{math|'''Sync'''}}: Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node.
* {{math|'''LossySync'''}}: Same as Sync, but can lose data if its output node is not ready to take data.
* {{math|'''Fifo'''{{angbr|''n''}}}}: Gets data from its input node, temporarily stores it in an internal buffer of size {{mvar|n}}, and propagates it to its output node (whenever this output node is ready to take data).
* {{math|'''SyncDrain'''}}: Atomically gets data from both its input nodes and loses it.
* {{math|'''Filter'''{{angbr|''c''}}}}: Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node if the filter condition {{mvar|c}} is satisfied; loses the data otherwise.

== Software Engineering Properties ==

=== Exogeneity ===

One way to classify coordination languages is in terms of their ''locus'': locus of coordination refers to where coordination activity takes place, classifying coordination models and languages as ''endogenous'' or ''exogenous''.&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-34874-3_12 Composition of Interacting Computations]. In Dina Goldin, Scott Smolka, and Peter Wegner, editors, Interactive Computation, pages 277-321. Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Endogenous models and languages, such as [[Linda (coordination language)|Linda]], provide primitives that must be incorporated within a computation for its coordination.
In applications that use such models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are inside the module itself.
In contrast, Reo is an exogenous language that provides primitives that support coordination of entities from without.
In applications that use exogenous models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are outside the module itself.

Endogenous models are sometimes more natural for a given application.
However, they generally lead to an intermixing of coordination primitives with computation code, which entangles the semantics of computation with coordination protocols. 
This intermixing tends to scatter communication/coordination primitives throughout the source code, making the cooperation model and the coordination protocol of an application nebulous and implicit: generally, there is no piece of source code identifiable as the cooperation model or the coordination protocol of an application, that can be
designed, developed, debugged, maintained, and reused, in isolation from the rest of the application code.
On the other hand, exogenous models encourage development of coordination modules separately and independently of the computation modules they are supposed to coordinate. Consequently, the result of the substantial effort invested in the design and development of the coordination component of an application can manifest itself as tangible "pure
coordinator modules" which are easier to understand, and can also be reused in other applications.

=== Compositionality / Reusability ===

Reo circuits are compositional.
This means that one can construct complex circuits by reusing simpler circuits.
To be more explicit, two circuits can be glued together on their boundary nodes to form a new joint circuit.
Unlike many other models of concurrency (e.g., [[pi-calculus]]), synchrony is preserved under composition.
This means that if we compose a circuit with synchronous flow between nodes A and B with another circuit with synchronous flow between nodes B and C, the joint circuit has synchronous flow between nodes A and C.
In other words, the composition of two synchronous circuits yields a synchronous circuit.

== Semantics ==

The semantics of a Reo circuit is a formal description of its behavior.
Various semantics for Reo exist.&lt;ref&gt;Sung-Shik Jongmans and Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.7561/SACS.2012.1.201 Overview of Thirty Semantic Formalisms for Reo]. Scientific Annals of Computer Science 22(1):201-251, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the first semantics of Reo was based on the [[coalgebra]]ic notion of streams (i.e., infinite sequences).&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-40020-2_2 A Coinductive Calculus of Component Connectors]. In Martin Wirsing, Dirk Pattinson, and Rolf Hennicker, editors, Proceedings of WADT 2002, volume 2755 of LNCS, pages 34--55. Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
This semantics is based on the concept of a ''timed data stream'', which is a pair consisting of a stream of data items and a stream of monotonically increasing time stamps (real numbers).
By associating every node with such a timed data stream, the behavior of a channel can be modeled as a relation on the streams on the connected nodes.

Later, an [[Automata theory|automaton]]-based semantics was developed, which is called [[constraint automata]].&lt;ref&gt;Christel Baier, Marjan Sirjani, Farhad Arbab, and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2005.10.008 Modeling component connectors in Reo by constraint automata]. Science of Computer Programming 61(2):75-113, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A constraint automaton is a labeled transition system, where transition labels consist of a ''synchronization constraint'' and a ''data constraint''.
A synchronization constraint specifies which nodes synchronize in the execution step modeled by the transition, and a data constraint specifies which data items flow on these nodes.

One limitation of constraint automata (and timed data streams) is that they cannot directly model ''context-sensitive'' behavior, where the behavior of a channel depends on the (un)availability of a pending I/O operation.
For example, using constraint automata, it is impossible to directly model the behavior of a LossySync, which should lose data only if its output node has no pending get-request.
To solve this problem, another semantics of Reo has been developed, called ''connector coloring''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Clarke and David Costa and Farhad Arbab: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2007.01.009 Connector colouring I: Synchronisation and context dependency]. Science of Computer Programming 66(3):205-225, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other semantics for Reo make it possible to model timed&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Arbab, Christel Baier, Frank de Boer, and Jan Rutten: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-006-0009-9 Models and temporal logical specifications for timed component connectors]. Software and Systems Modeling 6(1):59-82, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or probabilistic&lt;ref&gt;Christel Baier: [https://dx.doi.org/10.3217/jucs-011-10-1718 Probabilistic Models for Reo Connector Circuits]. Journal of Universal Computer Science 11(10):1718-1748, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; behavior.

== Implementations ==

The [http://reo.project.cwi.nl Extensible Coordination Tools] (ECT) are a set of plug-ins for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] that constitute an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for Reo.
The ECT consists of a graphical editor for drawing circuits and an animation engine for animating data-flow through circuits.
For code generation, the ECT contains a Reo-to-Java compiler, which generates code for circuits based on their constraint automaton semantics.
In particular, on input of a Reo circuit, it produces a Java class, which simulates the constraint automaton that models the circuit.
For verification, the ECT contains a tool that translates Reo circuits to process definitions in [[mCRL2]].
Users can subsequently use mCRL2 for model checking against [[Modal μ-calculus|mu-calculus]] property specifications.
(Alternatively, the Vereofy model checker also supports verification of Reo circuits.)

Another implementation of Reo is developed in the Scala programming language and executes circuits in a distributed fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Proenca: [http://hdl.handle.net/1887/17624 Synchronous Coordination of Distributed Components]. PhD thesis, Leiden University, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Writing on a grain of rice.jpg|thumb|A person writing on a grain of rice.]]
'''Rice writing''' is the art and skill of being able to write small enough to write on a grain of [[rice]].

==History==
Rice writing originated in Ancient [[Anatolia]] in Turkey and India. Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient [[Anatolia]] artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of  artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.

==Rice art Symbolism==
Rice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.

==Rice art and Rice jewelry today==
[[File:Grain of rice necklace-2.jpg|thumb|A necklace containing a grain of rice with the name "Filip" written on it.]]
Within time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.

==Technique==
Most modern day rice writers use the following tools:  
#Common long grain white rice:  This rice is a flat cylinder shape.  Because it is flat it provides two wide surfaces for writing.
#Sharp utility knife:  This is used to scrape the rice slightly to remove ridges to provide a smooth surface for writing.  This scraping method can also be used to remove minor mistakes. 
#[[Clay]]:  Some people use a utility gripper clay and others use a modeling clay.  The clay is used to hold the rice in place while performing the writing.
#[[Technical pen]]:  This is a drawing pen with an ultra-fine tip.  Most pens used are either size .18 (4x0) or .13 (6x0).  These can be purchased online, or at some arts and crafts stores.
#Waterproof Ink: This ink is sold with the technical pen.

Once the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.  Many craftsman mount these vials into [[jewelery]] such as necklaces, bracelets and key chains.

'''''Sex Education''''' is a 1995 book by the American author Jenny Davis. It was written for readers in grades 9-12 and tells the story of two teens who, working together on a term project for their sex education class, are instructed to care for someone else for the semester. They choose a lonely, pregnant neighbor, a task that proves more difficult than they anticipated.

The book has been the subject of many legal challenges, according to the [[American Library Association]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for the creation of [[alternating current]] (AC) [[waveform]]s; most commonly to drive [[3 phase]] AC powered motors at varying speeds from DC using multiple [[Switching amplifier|class-D amplifiers]]. There are variations of SVM that result in different quality and computational requirements. One active area of development is in the reduction of [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) created by the rapid switching inherent to these algorithms.

==Principle==

[[File:Three leg inverter.gif|240px|thumb|right|Topology of a basic three phase inverter.]]

A three-phase inverter as shown to the right converts a DC supply, via a series of switches, to three output legs which could be connected to a three-phase motor.

The switches must be controlled so that at no time are both switches in the same leg turned on or else the DC supply would be shorted. This requirement may be met by the complementary operation of the switches within a leg. i.e. if A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is on then A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is off and vice versa. This leads to eight possible switching vectors for the inverter, V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; through V&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; with six active switching vectors and two zero vectors.

To implement space vector modulation, a reference signal V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is sampled with a frequency f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;). The reference signal may be generated from three separate phase references using the [[Alpha beta gamma transform|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform]]. The reference vector is then synthesized using a combination of the two adjacent active switching vectors and one or both of the zero vectors. Various strategies of selecting the order of the vectors and which zero vector(s) to use exist. Strategy selection will affect the harmonic content and the switching losses.

An example V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in the first sector. V&lt;sub&gt;ref_MAX&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum amplitude of V&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; before non-linear overmodulation is reached.]]

More complicated SVM strategies for the unbalanced operation of four-leg three-phase inverters do exist. In these strategies the switching vectors define a 3D shape (a hexagonal [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] in &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; coordinates&lt;ref&gt;R. Zhang, V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5114">In [[systems engineering]], the '''system usability scale''' ('''SUS''') is a simple, ten-item attitude [[Likert scale]] giving a global view of subjective assessments of [[usability]]. It was developed by John Brooke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  author = Brooke, J. | year = 1996| chapter= SUS: a "quick and dirty" usability scale | editors =P. W. Jordan, B. Thomas, B. A. Weerdmeester, &amp; A. L. McClelland | title=Usability Evaluation in Industry | publisher = London: Taylor and Francis| url = http://www.usabilitynet.org/trump/documents/Suschapt.doc }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1986 as a tool to be used in [[usability engineering]] of [[electronic office]] systems.

The usability of a system, as defined by the ISO standard [[ISO 9241]] Part 11, can be measured only by taking into account the context of use of the system—i.e., who is using the system, what they are using it for, and the environment in which they are using it. Furthermore, measurements of usability have several different aspects:

* effectiveness (can users successfully achieve their objectives)
* efficiency (how much effort and resource is expended in achieving those objectives)
* satisfaction (was the experience satisfactory)

Measures of effectiveness and efficiency are also context specific. Effectiveness in using a system for controlling a continuous industrial process would generally be measured in very different terms to, say, effectiveness in using a text editor. Thus, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question "is system A more usable than system B", because the measures of effectiveness and efficiency may be very different. However, it can be argued that given a sufficiently high-level definition of ''subjective'' assessments of usability, comparisons can be made between systems.

SUS has generally been seen as providing this type of high-level subjective view of usability and is thus often used in carrying out comparisons of usability between systems. Because it yields a single score on a scale of 0–100, it can be used to compare even systems that are outwardly dissimilar. This one-dimensional aspect of the SUS is both a benefit and a drawback, because the questionnaire is necessarily quite general. 
Recently, Lewis and Sauro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, J.R.  |author2=Sauro, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2009 | title = The factor structure of the system usability scale | publisher = international conference (HCII 2009), San Diego CA, USA | url=http://www.measuringusability.com/papers/Lewis_Sauro_HCII2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested a two-factor orthogonal structure, which practitioners may use to score the SUS on independent Usability and Learnability dimensions. At the same time, Borsci, Federici and Lauriola&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Borsci, S., Federici,S., &amp; Lauriola, M. | year = 2009 | title = On the dimensionality of the System Usability Scale: a test of alternative measurement models | journal = Cognitive processing | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 193–197 | doi = 10.1007/s10339-009-0268-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an independent analysis confirm the two factors structure of SUS, also showing that those factors (Usability and Learnability) are correlated.

The SUS has been widely used in the evaluation of a range of systems. Bangor, Kortum and Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bangor, Aaron, Kortum, Philip T. and Miller, James T. | year= 2008 | title= An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 574–594 | doi=10.1080/10447310802205776}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the scale extensively over a ten-year period and have produced normative data that allow SUS ratings to be positioned relative to other systems. They propose an extension to SUS to provide an adjective rating that correlates with a given score.  Based on a review of hundreds of usability studies, Sauro and Lewis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  author = Sauro, J., &amp; Lewis, J. R | year = 2012 | title = Quantifying the user experience: Practical statistics for user research | publisher = Morgan Kaufmann, Waltham MA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a curved grading scale for mean SUS scores.

[[File:WAM pied girl.jpg|thumb|A woman who has been pied]]

'''Wet and messy fetish (WAM)''', also known as '''sploshing''', is a form of [[sexual fetishism]] whereby a person becomes aroused when copious amounts of a substance are applied to the naked skin, face, or to clothing.{{r|Gates (2000)}} Several dozen websites are dedicated to WAM.

Many people with WAM fetishes are drawn to the tactile sensations of wet or messy substances against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the visual appeal of others getting wet or messy with products that have different textures, consistencies and colours. A subject will often be [[pieing|pelted with cream pies]] (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.

Messy substances most commonly focused on by WAM participants include whipped cream, raw eggs, milk, lotion (see [[lotion play]]), paint, oil, mud, pudding, chocolate sauce, fruit juice, beer, shaving foam, custard, baked beans, [[treacle]], ketchup, ice cream, peanut butter, [[gunge|slime]], and cake batter, among others.

A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, and [[Female ejaculation|female ejaculate]] is not considered part of WAM. The former three are typically considered [[coprophilia]], [[urophilia]], and [[emetophilia]]; urophilia is somewhat commonly found in mainstream pornography.{{r|Gates (2000)}} The later two are also somewhat mainstream.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

WAM fetish videos (made by both fans and commercial producers) may include nudity and sexual acts, while others may only feature fully clothed participants. Videos can frequently be seen on public video hosting sites like YouTube. Some of these videos are flagged but most of them remain available despite the sexual undertones, mainly because a large majority of wet and messy videos posted publicly do not include nudity and are therefore considered suitable for all audiences to view. Indeed, not only is much WAM video content indistinguishable in any easily defined sense from the kind of [[slapstick]] featured in mainstream entertainment, but scenes of slimings or pieings from the mainstream media are often compiled and marketed by producers towards a WAM fetishist target audience.

==Crossover with other fetishes==
There is some crossover between the wet and messy fetish and clothing destruction fetishes. Some WAM productions will see models start out fully dressed, usually in quite smart outfits such as formal dresses or suits; they will then be covered in messy substances, after which their messy clothes are cut up, typically with scissors, leaving them naked or nearly so.

WAM is sometimes also combined with [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], where a subject is first restrained or chained up and then hosed down or messed up.  Wet and Messy fetishism lends itself well to domination/submission role-playing. 

"Cake Sitting" (the act of deliberately sitting on a large cake or gateaux, either clothed or nude) is often considered a sub-fetish in its own right, but may be linked to the [[crush fetish]].  While participants who sit on cakes for pleasure will do so for the tactile sensory experience, or as part of submissive role-playing, those who enjoy watching the act will often focus specifically on the crushing of the dessert as a visual stimulus for a sexual reaction.

==Psychology==
No conclusive research has been conducted into the psychology behind the fetish; however, it is not uncommon for fetishists to have had interest in the sensations of messy play since their formative years (age 3–4) with a sexual element manifesting with the onset of puberty. For many, the simple breaking of taboos—doing what one was told not to as a child—brings about a sense of personal liberation. In any form, the fetish is about sensual stimulation, whether visual, tactile, or otherwise.

One unproven theory is that individuals drawn to WAM have [[sensory processing disorder|low tactile sensitivity]], which is increased and intensified by wet substances acting as a lubricant under applied pressure or friction. "Messy play" is a common clinical therapy used in treating hypo-tactile patients (mostly pediatric cases) to give them an outlet and appropriate time and place to engage in mess-making.{{r|Kranowitz (2007)}}

Another aspect is the link to other fetishes, as some wet and messy play is done in a submissive or dominating way and has possible links to BDSM, the emphasis being on the humiliation of the victim, although this is often mitigated or negated by the victim taking it in good humour. The dominant partner inflicting the mess can also be an object of attraction as an assertive figure of playful mischief.

==In media==
The popular sex column ''[[Savage Love]]'' has mentioned WAM. In one article, there was a reply to a letter from the roommate of someone who masturbates with condiments, possibly for fetishistic purposes. [[Dan Savage|Daniel Savage]], the writer of ''Savage Love,'' did not condemn the use of condiments in that incident, but, instead, only chided the fetishist for using condiments that were later used by others.{{r|Savage (2004)}}

'''Wood''' is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the [[Plant stem|stems]] and roots of [[tree]]s and other [[woody plant]]s. It is an [[organic material]], a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.

Wood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]]. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as [[cellophane]] and [[cellulose acetate#production|cellulose acetate]].

As of 2005, the growing stock of [[forest]]s worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters, 47% of which was commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/A0400E/A0400E06.pdf|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Horst H.

==History==

A 2011 discovery in the [[Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]] yielded the earliest known plants to have grown wood, approximately 395 to 400 [[million years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|title=N.B. fossils show origins of wood|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011|date=August 12, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813012432/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|archivedate=August 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philippe Gerrienne et al.|title=A Simple Type of Wood in Two Early Devonian Plants|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6044|pages=837|date=Aug 12, 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1208882|pmid=21836008|bibcode=2011Sci...333..837G|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/jspui/handle/2268/97121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can be dated by [[carbon dating]] and in some species by [[dendrochronology]] to determine when a wooden object was created.

People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a [[fuel]] or as a [[construction]] material for making [[house]]s, [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]], [[packaging]], [[artwork]]s, and [[paper]]. Known [[construction]]s using wood date back ten thousand years. Buildings like the European Neolithic long house were made primarily of wood.

Recent use of wood has been enhanced by the addition of steel and bronze into construction.&lt;ref name="A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sarah|title=A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century|url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|website=EcoBUILDING|publisher=A Publication of The American Institute of Architects|accessdate=March 28, 2017|ref=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051421/http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|archivedate=March 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealized vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]

===Growth rings===
{{main article|Growth rings}}

Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].

Where the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.

If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).

===Knots===
&lt;!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]

As a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular "solid" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood "flows" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.

In the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.

In grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]
{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J.

Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.

In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.

===Heartwood and sapwood===&lt;!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood, dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot). The dark radial lines are small knots.]]
'''Heartwood''' (or duramen&lt;ref name=eb-duramen&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Duramen|volume=8|page=692|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.&lt;ref&gt;Shigo, Alex. (1986) ''A New Tree Biology Dictionary''. Shigo and Trees, Associates. {{ISBN|0943563127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood, and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.

Sapwood (or alburnum&lt;ref name="eb-alburnum"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,&lt;ref&gt;Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0881926558}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.

The term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IbjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=The+term+heartwood+derives+solely+from+its+position+and+not+from+any+vital+importance+to+the+tree+as+a+tree+can+thrive+with+heart+completely+decayed#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20term%20heartwood%20derives%20solely%20from%20its%20position%20and%20not%20from%20any%20vital%20importance%20to%20the%20tree%20as%20a%20tree%20can%20thrive%20with%20heart%20completely%20decayed&amp;f=false|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.

When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.

It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.

===Color===
[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.

Some experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called "fat lighter". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.

Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.

Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

===Water content===
Water occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:
* in the [[cell wall]]s,
* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem

In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.

The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&amp;nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book

It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of [[cellulose]] (40–50%) and [[hemicellulose]] (15–25%) impregnated with [[lignin]] (15–30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|title=Wood Properties Growth and Structure 2015|work=treetesting.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313044617/http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coniferous or [[softwood]] species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, [[tracheid]]s, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most [[hardwood]]s. There are no vessels ("pores") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.

The structure of hardwoods is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|title=Timber Plus Toolbox, Selecting timber, Characteristics of timber, Structure of hardwoods|work=nationalvetcontent.edu.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810184152/https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by [[vessel element|vessels]]: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others ([[Aesculus|buckeye]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]]) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ''ring-porous'' and ''diffuse-porous''.&lt;ref name=sperry1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperry|first=John S. |author2=Nichols, Kirk L. |author3=Sullivan, June E. |author4=Eastlack, Sondra E.|title=Xylem Embolism in ring-porous, diffuse-porous, and coniferous trees of Northern Utah and Interior Alaska |journal=Ecology |date=1994 |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1736–1752 |jstor=1939633 |doi=10.2307/1939633 |url=http://bioweb.biology.utah.edu/sperry/publications/Sperry%20et%20al.%201994%20Ecology.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, [[catalpa]], chestnut, [[elm]], hickory, [[mulberry]], and oak,&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localized in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row. Examples of this kind of wood are [[Alnus|alder]],&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; [[Tilia|basswood]],&lt;ref name="Record1914"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel James Record|title=The mechanical properties of wood, including a discussion of the factors affecting the mechanical properties, and methods of timber testing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVgDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44|year=1914|publisher=J.

===Earlywood and latewood===

====In softwood====
[[File:Wood Pseudotsuga taxifolia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a softwood; radial view, growth rings closely spaced in [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]]]
In temperate softwoods, there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.

It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.

No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.

====In ring-porous woods====
[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]
In ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.

In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.

In ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.

Wide-ringed wood is often called "second-growth", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such "second-growth" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:
:"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough."&lt;ref name=USforest&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315214043/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm |date=March 15, 2007 }}''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:

:"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter."&lt;ref name=USforest/&gt;

====In diffuse-porous woods====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.

In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.

===Monocot wood===
[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]
Structural material that resembles ordinary, "dicot" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.

===Specific gravity===
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.&lt;/ref&gt; as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt;

===Wood density===

{{See also|Janka hardness test}}

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “one fairly easily measured wood characteristic” (Elliott 1970).&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt; Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

==Hard and soft woods==

It is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.

There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].

==Chemistry of wood==
[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mémotech Bois et Matériaux Associés|date=1996|publisher=Éditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2713516450|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et Jérôme Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.

Aside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.

In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.&lt;ref name=boerjan&gt;{{cite journal| author = W. Boerjan| author2 =  J. Ralph| author3 = M. Baucher|date=June 2003| title = Lignin biosynthesis| journal = Annu. Rev.

===Extractives===
Aside from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]], wood consists of a variety of low [[molecular weight]] [[organic compound]]s, called ''extractives''. The wood [[extract]]ives are [[fatty acid]]s, [[resin acid]]s, [[wax]]es and [[terpene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mimms |first = Agneta |author2=Michael J. Kuckurek |author3=Jef A.

==Uses==

===Fuel===
{{Main article|Wood fuel}}
Wood has a long history of being used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jFvrF4DaZcgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+has+a+long+history+of+being+used+as+fuel#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20has%20a%20long%20history%20of%20being%20used%20as%20fuel&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Fuels and the Environment|last=Sterrett|first=Frances S.|date=1994-10-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0873719780|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.

===Construction===

[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).

Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA7-PA15&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&amp;f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1118421604|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].

[[File:Преображенская церковь (деревянная) (1714 г.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]
New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.

In buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.

Wood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.

====Wood flooring====
[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]
{{Main article |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.

Solid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.

Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].

====Engineered wood====
{{main article |Engineered wood}}

Engineered wood products, glued building products "engineered" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.&lt;ref name="apawood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA – The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.&lt;ref name="apawood" /&gt; Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.

Wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].

===Furniture and utensils===
Wood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].

===Next generation wood products===
Further developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.&lt;ref&gt;"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the arts===
[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]
Wood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').

Other uses of wood in the arts include:
* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]
* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]
* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood

===Sports and recreational equipment===
Many types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].

Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.

==Bacterial degradation==
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood; while bacteria such as ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzhöfer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DO ''not'' ADD A "Popular culture" SECTION HERE. There has been extensive discussion about why this is inappropriate on the article's talk page. Adding a "Pop culture" section based on the xkcd comic will be viewed as vandalism--it isn't clever or funny. Any such addition will be subsequently removed, and you may be banned from editing further.--&gt;
