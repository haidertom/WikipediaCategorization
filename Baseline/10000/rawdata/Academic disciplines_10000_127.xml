'''''A Smile as Big as the Moon''''' is a [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] television movie. The film debuted on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on January 29, 2012.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]] stars in this film based on the 2002 memoir of the same title by teacher Mike Kersjes and Joe Layden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2001048779 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709192342/http://lccn.loc.gov/2001048779 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |title=A Smile as Big as the Moon |publisher=Library of Congress |work=Library of Congress Online Catalog |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie shows the challenges Kersjes faced as he worked to bring out the best from his [[special education]] students by taking them to [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]], which had, until that time been perceived as a program best suited to advanced science and math students, well beyond the reach of special education students.   Several actors playing students in the film have [[Down syndrome]], [[autism]] and/or [[learning disability|learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="smart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gettingsmart.com/news/a-smile-as-big-as-the-moon-airs-abc-tonight-9-pm-est/ | title=‘A Smile As Big As the Moon’ Airs ABC January 29th | date=January 8, 2012 | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=Cargill, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ben, a student with Down syndrome, in Mike Kersjes's [[Forest Hills Northern High School]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], special education class, dreams of becoming an [[astronaut]]. Kersjes, who is also a [[American football|football]] coach is inspired to pursue Space Camp for his students.  Obstacles mount as school administrators object to the expense and Space Camp officials have no experience with special-ed students.  Teacher Robynn McKinney supports Kersjes's efforts.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

Eventually the trip is approved by the necessary parties, and Kersjes faces another set of challenges: fundraising, preparing the students for their trip with science and physical education, and battling bullying and belittling from other students.  Kersjes engages the football team in these endeavors.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

==Filming==
The film was shot primarily in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and at [[United States Space Camp]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/tv/index.ssf/2012/01/a_smile_as_big_as_the_moon_sta.html&lt;/ref&gt; One scene used Sky Theater inside [[Ingram Planetarium]] of [[Sunset Beach, North Carolina]], which was adapted to appear as a [[planetarium]] would have in 1988. Filming took place there September 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/01/22/2617313/nc-planetarium-has-starring-role.html |title=N.C. planetarium has starring role in upcoming TV movie |last=Palisin |first=Steve |work=[[The Sun News]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2012-01-25 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships|emotions}}
In [[psychology]], the [[theory of attachment]] can be applied to adult relationships including friendships, emotional affairs, adult romantic or platonic relationships and in some cases relationships with inanimate objects ("[[transitional objects]]").&lt;ref name= "Hooley JM, Wilson-Murphy M"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hooley JM.|author2=Wilson-Murphy M.|title=Adult attachment to transitional objects and borderline personality disorder|pmid=22486448|doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.179|volume=26|journal=J Pers Disord|pages=179-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult relationships in the late 1980s.

Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:
*secure
*anxious-preoccupied
*dismissive-avoidant
*fearful-avoidant

Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental ''working models'' that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.

==Extending attachment theory==
[[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[John Bowlby]] founded modern attachment theory on studies of children and their caregivers. Children and caregivers remained the primary focus of attachment theory for many years. Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships.&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazan C. |author2=Shaver P.R. |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=March 1987 |pmid=3572722 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1990 | title = Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 270–280 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children and caregivers. For example, romantic or platonic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.

Relationships between adults differ in many ways from relationships between children and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm|title=A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research {{!}} R. Chris Fraley|website=internal.psychology.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not that these two kinds of relationships are identical. The claim is that the core principles of attachment theory apply to both kinds of relationships.

Investigators tend to describe the core principles of attachment theory in light of their own theoretical interests. Their descriptions seem quite different on a superficial level. For example, Fraley and Shaver&lt;ref name="Fraley Shaver 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 2000 | title = Adult attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–154 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "central propositions" of attachment in adults as follows:
* The emotional and behavioral dynamics of infant–caregiver relationships and adult relationships are governed by the same biological system.
* The kinds of individual differences observed in infant–caregiver relationships are similar to the ones observed in various close adult relationships.
* Individual differences in adult attachment behavior are reflections of the expectations and beliefs people have formed about themselves and their close relationships on the basis of their attachment histories; these "working models" are relatively stable and, as such, may be reflections of early caregiving experiences.
* Romantic love, as commonly conceived, involves the interplay of attachment, caregiving and intimacy.

Compare this with the five "core propositions" of attachment theory listed by Rholes and Simpson:&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson 04"&gt;Rholes, W.S. &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2004). Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions. In W.S. Rholes and J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications'', pp. 3–14. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the basic impetus for the formation of attachment relationships is provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.
* Experiences in earlier relationships create internal working models and attachment styles that systematically affect attachment relationships.
* The attachment orientations of adult caregivers influence the attachment bond their children have with them.
* Working models and attachment orientations are relatively stable over time, but they are not impervious to change.
* Some forms of psychological maladjustment and clinical disorders are attributable in part to the effects of insecure working models and attachment styles.

While these two lists clearly reflect the theoretical interests of the investigators who created them, a closer look reveals a number of shared themes. The shared themes claim that:
* People are biologically driven to form attachments with others, but the process of forming attachments is influenced by learning experiences.
* Individuals form different kinds of attachments depending on the expectations and beliefs they have about their relationships. These expectations and beliefs constitute internal "working models" used to guide relationship behaviors.
* Internal "working models" are relatively stable even though they can be influenced by experience.
* Individual differences in attachment can contribute positively or negatively to mental health and to the quality of relationships with others.

No doubt these themes could be described in a variety of ways (and other themes added to the list). Regardless of how one describes the core principles of attachment theory, the key insight is that the same principles of attachment apply to close relationships throughout the lifespan. The principles of attachment between children and caregivers are fundamentally the same as the principles of attachment between adults.

==Styles==
Adults are described as having 4 attachment styles: Secure, Anxious-preoccupied, Dismissive-avoidant, and Fearful-avoidant.

The secure attachment style in adults corresponds to the secure attachment style in children. The anxious–preoccupied attachment style in adults corresponds to the anxious-ambivalent attachment style in children. However, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style and the fearful-avoidant attachment style, which are distinct in adults, correspond to a single avoidant attachment style in children. The descriptions of adult attachment styles offered below are based on the relationship questionnaire devised by Bartholomew and Horowitz&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=226–44 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1920064 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/61/2/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a review of studies by Pietromonaco and Barrett.&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |title=Working models of attachment and daily social interactions |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1409–23 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9418285 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1409 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/73/6/1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people tend to agree with the following statements: "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence. 

Secure attachment and adaptive functioning are promoted by a caregiver who is emotionally available and appropriately responsive to his or her child's attachment behavior, as well as capable of regulating both his or her positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Pat|title=What is Adult Attachment?|journal=Clin Soc Work J|date=2008|volume=36 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1007/s10615-007-0110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===

==== Anxious-preoccupied ====
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to agree with the following statements: "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." People with this style of attachment seek high levels of [[intimacy]], approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy to such an extent that they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared with securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often [[doubt]] their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, [[emotional dysregulation]], worry, and [[impulsiveness]] in their relationships.

==== Dismissive-avoidant ====
People with a dismissive style of avoidant attachment tend to agree with these statements: "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is  important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the [[Defense mechanism|defensive]] character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with [[Social rejection|rejection]] by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments or relationships).

==== Fearful-avoidant ====
People with losses or other trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contextualizing the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult self- and social functioning: an attachment theory perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213499000812 | doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00081-2 | volume=23|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|pages=1141–1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to agree with the following statements: "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to other people."
They tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and the mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive-avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.

==Working models==
Bowlby observed that children learn from their interactions with caregivers. Over the course of many interactions, children form expectations about the accessibility and helpfulness of their caregivers. These expectations reflect children's thoughts about themselves and about their caregivers:
{{quote|Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: (a) whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection; (b) whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically, these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger, Volume 2 of Attachment and loss London. Hogarth Press; New York: Basic Books; Harmondsworth: Penguin (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Children's thoughts about their caregivers, together with thoughts about how deserving they are themselves of good care from their caregivers, form ''working models'' of attachment. Working models help guide behavior by allowing children to anticipate and plan for caregiver responses. Bowlby theorized that once formed,  working models remain relatively stable. Children usually interpret experiences in the light of their working models, rather than change their working models to fit new experiences. However, when experiences cannot be interpreted in the light of their working models children may then modify their working models.

When Hazen and Shaver extended attachment theory to romantic relationships in adults, they also included the idea of working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the thoughts that form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.

===Organization of working models===
Bartholomew and Horowitz have proposed that working models consist of two parts.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"/&gt; One part deals with thoughts about the self. The other part deals with thoughts about others. They further propose that a person's thoughts about self are generally positive or generally negative. The same applies to a person's thoughts about others. In order to test these proposals, Bartholomew and Horowitz have looked at the relationship between attachment styles, self-esteem, and sociability. The diagram below shows the relationships they observed:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Security-based strategy of affect regulation
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="background: none;" |
! colspan=2 | Self-esteem&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about self)

! Positive
| Secure
| Anxious-preoccupied
|-
! Negative
| Dismissive-avoidant
| Fearful-avoidant
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The secure and dismissive attachment styles are associated with higher self-esteem compared with the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain can be characterized as generally positive or generally negative.

Baldwin and colleagues have applied the theory of relational schemas to working models of attachment. Relational schemas contain information about the way the attachment figure regularly interact with each other.&lt;ref name= "Baldwin 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1992 | title = Relational schemas and the processing of social information | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 461–484 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1997 | title = Relational schemas as a source of if-then self-inference procedures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 326–335 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.1.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each pattern of interaction that regularly occurs between partners, a relational schema is formed that contains:
* information about the self
* information about the attachment
* information about the way the interaction usually unfolds.

For example, if a person regularly asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information about the way the interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., "''If'' I ask my partner for a hug or kiss, ''then'' my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.

Baldwin and colleagues have proposed that working models of attachment are composed of relational schemas. The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others is consistent with previous conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is the information about the way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr Keedian Seidel Thompson 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | last3 = Keedian | first3 = E. | last4 = Seidel | first4 = M. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = D.W. | year = 1993 | title = An exploration of the relational schemata underlying attachment styles: self-report and lexical decision approaches | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 746–754 | doi=10.1177/0146167293196010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scenarios for closeness included:
* You want to spend more time with your attachment.
* You reach out to hug or kiss your partner.
* You tell your attachment how deeply you feel for him or her.

Following each scenario, people were presented with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was "he/she accepts you." The other option was "he/she rejects you." People were asked to rate the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my partner will accept me." People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my attachment will reject me." Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | year = 1995 | title = On the Instability of Attachment Style Ratings | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 247–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00090.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Keelan | first2 = J.P.R. | last3 = Fehr | first3 = B. | last4 = Enns | first4 = V. | last5 = Koh-Rangarajoo | first5 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Social-cognitive conceptualization of attachment working models: Availability and accessibility effects | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 94–109 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Meunier 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Meunier | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = The Cued Activation of Attachment Relational Schemas | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 209–227 | doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational schemas involved in working models are likely organized into a hierarchy. According to Baldwin:
{{quote|A person may have a general working model of relationships, for instance, to the effect that others tend to be only partially and unpredictably responsive to one's needs. At a more specific level, this expectation will take different forms when considering different role relationships, such as customer or romantic partner. Within romantic relationships, expectations might then vary significantly depending on the specific attachment, or the specific situation, or the specific needs being expressed. (Baldwin, 1992, p. 429).&lt;ref name="Baldwin 92"/&gt;}}

The highest level of the hierarchy contains very general relational schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.

In fact, several theorists have proposed a hierarchical organization of working models.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 80"&gt;Bowlby, J.

Security in infancy, childhood, and adulthood: A move to the level of representation. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'', 50 (1–2, Serial No. 209).&lt;/ref&gt; Pietromonaco and Barrett note:
{{quote|From this perspective, people do not hold a single set of working models of the self and others; rather, they hold a family of models that include, at higher levels, abstract rules or assumptions about attachment relationships and, at lower levels, information about specific relationships and events within relationships. These ideas also imply that working models are not a single entity but are multifaceted representations in which information at one level need not be consistent with information at another level. (Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000, page 159)&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietromonaco | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Barrett | first2 = L.F. | year = 2000 | title = The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 155–175 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every hierarchy for working models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies have supported the existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, and the majority of their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"/&gt; A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. Yet, people also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers.&lt;ref name="Trinke Bartholomew 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trinke | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Hierarchies of attachment relationships in young adulthood | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 603–625 | doi=10.1177/0265407597145002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Guardia Ryan Couchman Deci 00"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Guardia JG, Ryan RM, Couchman CE, Deci EL |title=Within-person variation in security of attachment: a self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10981840 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/79/3/367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.&lt;ref name="Overall Fletcher Friesen 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overall | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = G.J.O. | last3 = Friesen | first3 = M.D. | year = 2003 | title = Mapping the [[intimate relationship]] mind: Comparisons between three models of attachment representations | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1479–1493 | doi=10.1177/0146167203251519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the mental working models that underlie attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information about others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.

===Stability of working models===
Investigators study the stability of working models by looking at the stability of attachment styles. Attachment styles reflect the thoughts and expectations that constitute working models. Changes in attachment styles therefore indicate changes in working models.

Around 70–80% of people experience no significant changes in attachment styles over time.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Merrick | first2 = S. | last3 = Treboux | first3 = D. | last4 = Crowell | first4 = J. | last5 = Albersheim | first5 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 684–689 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176 | pmid=10953934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Hazen 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L. | last2 = Hazen | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment styles and close relationships: A four year prospective study | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J. | last2 = Noller | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Attachment style and romantic love: Relationship dissolution | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 69–74 | doi=10.1080/00049539208260145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfe Bartholomew 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharfe | first1 = E. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Reliability and stability of adult attachment patterns | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that attachment styles do not change for a majority of people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% of people do experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.

Why attachment styles change is not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Weinfield Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.S. | last3 = Hamilton | first3 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment styles from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood: General discussion | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = Continuity and discontinuity of attachment from infancy through adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 690–694 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinfield Sroufe Egelund 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinfield | first1 = N.

The study found that all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.

==Relationship outcomes==
Adult relationships vary in their outcomes. The participants of some relationships express more [[Contentment|satisfaction]] than the participants of other relationships. The participants of some relationships stay together longer than the partners of other relationships. Does attachment influence the satisfaction and duration of relationships?

===Satisfaction===
Several studies have linked attachment styles to relationship satisfaction. People who have secure attachment styles usually express greater satisfaction with their relationships than people who have other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Brennan Shaver 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Dimensions of adult attachment, affect regulation, and romantic relationship functioning | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1177/0146167295213008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, communication patterns and satisfaction across the life cycle of marriage | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 333–348 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 401–416 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller Callan 94"&gt;Feeney, J.A., Noller, P., &amp; Callan, V.J.

Although the link between attachment styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Keelan Dion Dion 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keelan | first1 = J.P.R. | last2 = Dion | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Dion | first3 = K.L. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment style and relationship satisfaction: Test of a self-disclosure explanation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 24–35 | doi=10.1037/h0087055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name="Feeney 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = Adult attachment, emotional control, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 169–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury Fincham 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | last3 = Fincham | first3 = F. | year = 1998 | title = Negative affectivity as a mediator of the association between adult attachment and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 467–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for coping with conflict,&lt;ref name="Lussier Sabourin Turgeon 97"/&gt; and perceived support from partners.&lt;ref name="Meyers Landsberger 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cobb | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Davila | first2 = J. | last3 = Bradbury | first3 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment security and marital satisfaction: The role of positive perceptions and social support | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1131–1143 | doi=10.1177/0146167201279006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.

===Duration===
Some studies suggest people with secure attachment styles have longer-lasting relationships.&lt;ref name="Simpson 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | year = 1990 | title = Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 971–980 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duemmler Kobak 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duemmler | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Kobak | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = The development of commitment and attachment in dating relationships: attachment security as relationship construct | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 401–415 | doi=10.1006/jado.2001.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles also tend to be more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.

Nor are secure attachment styles the only attachment styles associated with stable relationships. People with anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often find themselves in long-lasting, but unhappy, relationships.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Davis 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K.E. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, gender, and relationship stability: A longitudinal analysis | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 502–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment insecurity and the distinction between unhappy spouses who do and do not divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 371–393 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.15.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often involve anxiety about being abandoned and doubts about one's worth as a relationship. These kinds of feelings and thoughts may lead people to stay in unhappy relationships.

==Relationship dynamics==
Attachment plays a role in the way actors interact with one another. A few examples include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and [[jealousy]]. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also plays a role in many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson Stevens 98"&gt;Rholes, W.S., Simpson, J.A., &amp; Stevens, J.G. (1998). Attachment orientations, social support, and conflict resolution in close relationships. In W.S. Rholes &amp; J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Attachment Theory and Close Relationships'' (pp. 166–188).

(pp. 183–201) Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affect regulation===
Bowlby, in studies with children, observed that certain kinds of events trigger anxiety, and that people try to relieve their anxiety by seeking closeness and comfort from caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982) Attachment, Vol. 1 of Attachment and loss. London: Hogarth Press. New York: Basic Books (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Three main sets of conditions trigger anxiety in children:
* Conditions of the child (fatigue, hunger, illness, pain, cold, etc.)
* Conditions involving the caregiver (caregiver absent, caregiver departing, caregiver discouraging of proximity, caregiver giving attention to another child, etc.)
* Conditions of the environment (alarming events, criticism or rejection by others)

The anxiety triggered by these conditions motivates the individuals to engage in behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate their anxiety by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.

Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have developed a model for this dynamic.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Pereg | first3 = D. | year = 2003 | title = Attachment theory and affect regulation: The dynamics, development, and cognitive consequences of attachment-related strategies | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 77–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1024515519160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce their anxiety by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.

The first strategy is called the ''security-based'' strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the security-based strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Security Based.png|border|center|Security-based strategy of affect regulation.]]
A person perceives something that provokes anxiety. The person tries to reduce the anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms a sense of security and reduces anxiety. The person returns to her or his everyday activities.

The second strategy is called the ''hyperactivation'', or anxiety attachment, strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the hyperactivation strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Hyperactivation.png|border|center|Hyperactivation strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs the request for greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even harder to get closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).

The third strategy is called the ''attachment avoidance'' strategy. The following diagram shows the sequence of events in the attachment avoidance strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Attachment Avoidance.png|border|center|Attachment avoidance strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way as the security-based strategy. A person perceives something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.

Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these strategies of regulating attachment anxiety have very different consequences.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"/&gt; The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave in a particular way and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.

===Support===
People feel less anxious when close to their attachments because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.

Attachment influences both the perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Kobak Sceery 88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobak | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Sceery | first2 = A. | year = 1988 | title = Attachment in late adolescence: Working models, affect regulation, and representations of self and others | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 135–146 | doi=10.2307/1130395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Florian Weller 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Florian | first2 = V. | last3 = Weller | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Attachment styles, coping strategies, and post-traumatic psychological distress: The impact of the Gulf War in Israel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 817–826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson Rholes Nelligan 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Rholes | first2 = W.S. | last3 = Nelligan | first3 = J.S. | year = 1992 | title = Support seeking and support giving within couples in an anxiety provoking situation: The role of attachment styles | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 434–446 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florian Mikulincer Bucholtz 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florian V, Mikulincer M, Bucholtz I |title=Effects of adult attachment style on the perception and search for social support |journal=J Psychol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=665–76 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7500299 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1995.9914937}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They may be more likely to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.

Changes in the way people perceive attachment tend to occur with changes in the way people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends&lt;ref name="Asendorpf Wilpers 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Wilpers | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security and available support: Closely linked relationship qualities | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 115–138 | doi=10.1177/0265407500171006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.

===Intimacy===
Attachment theory has always recognized the importance of intimacy. Bowlby writes:
{{quote|Attachment theory regards the propensity to make intimate emotional bonds to particular individuals as a basic component of human nature, already present in germinal form in the neonate and continuing through adult life into old age. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 120–121)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 88"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire for intimacy has biological roots and, in the great majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.

Collins and Feeney have examined the relationship between attachment and intimacy in detail.&lt;ref name="Collins Feeney 04"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'', pp. 163–188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They define intimacy as a special set of interactions in which a person discloses something important about himself or herself, and their attachment responds to the disclosure in a way that makes the person feel validated, understood, and cared for. These interactions usually involve verbal self-disclosure. However, intimate interactions can also involve non-verbal forms of self-expression such as touching, hugging, kissing, and sexual behavior. From this perspective, intimacy requires the following:
* willingness to disclose one's true thoughts, feelings, wishes, and fears
* willingness to rely on an attachment for care and emotional support
* willingness to engage in physical intimacy in the case of romantic or potential romantic partners

Collins and Feeney review a number of studies showing how each attachment style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.

Mashek and Sherman report some findings on the desire for less closeness with partners.&lt;ref name="Mashek Sherman 04"&gt;Mashek, D.J., &amp; Sherman, M.D. (2004). Desiring less closeness with initimate others. In A. Aron and Mashek, D.J. (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'' (pp. 343–356). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with their partners. On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful-avoidant and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with their partners. People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with their partners. On the other hand, the relatively large numbers of people who admit to wanting less closeness with their partners (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive-avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful-avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with their partners. The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.

===Jealousy===
{{main|Jealousy}}
Jealousy refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, it is not surprising that attachment also relates to jealousy.

Bowlby observed that attachment behaviors in children can be triggered by the presence of a rival:
{{quote|In most young children the mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough to elicit strong attachment behaviour. The older child insists on remaining close to his mother, or on climbing on to her lap. Often he behaves as though he were a baby. It is possible that this well-known behaviour is only a special case of a child reacting to mother's lack of attention and lack of responsiveness to him. The fact, however, that an older child often reacts in this way even when his mother makes a point of being attentive and responsive suggests that more is involved; and the pioneer experiments of Levy (1937) also indicate that the mere presence of a baby on mother's lap is sufficient to make an older child much more clinging. (Bowlby, 1969/1982, page 260)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"/&gt;}}

When children see a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, the children try to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail.&lt;ref name="Volling McElwain Miller 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volling | first1 = B.L. | last2 = McElwain | first2 = N.L. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.L. | year = 2002 | title = Emotion regulation in context: The jealousy complex between young siblings and its relations with child and family characteristics | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 581–600 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old.&lt;ref name="Hart 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = C.R. | year = 2004 | title = The evolution of jealousy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 62–71 | doi=10.1511/2004.45.919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.

Attachment and jealousy can be triggered by the same perceptual cues in adults, too.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the attachment can trigger both a need for close proximity and jealousy when people believe the attachment is spending time with a rival. The presence of a rival can also trigger greater need for attachment and jealousy.

Differences in attachment styles influence both the frequency and the pattern of jealous expressions. People who have anxious–preoccupied or fearful-avoidant attachment styles experience jealousy more often and view rivals as more threatening than people who have secure attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = B.P. | year = 1997 | title = Personality, birth order and attachment styles as related to various types of jealousy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 997–1006 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L.K. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment-style differences in the experience and expression of romantic jealousy | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radecki-Bush Farrell Bush 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radecki-Bush | first1 = C. | last2 = Farrell | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Bush | first3 = J.I. | year = 1993 | title = Predicting jealous responses: The influence of adult attachment and depression on threat appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 569–588 | doi=10.1177/0265407593104006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with different attachment styles also express jealousy in different ways. One study found that:
{{quote|Securely attached participants felt anger more intensely than other emotions and were relatively more likely than other participants to express it, especially toward their attachment. And although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely, and were as likely as others to express it through irritability, they were relatively unlikely to actually confront their attachment. This might be attributable to feelings of inferiority and fear, which were especially characteristic of the anxiously attached and which might be expected to inhibit direct expressions of anger. Avoidants felt sadness relatively more intensely than did secures in both studies. Further, avoidants were relatively more likely than others to work to maintain their self-esteem and, perhaps as a consequence, relatively unlikely to be brought closer to their attachment. (Sharpsteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 637)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;}}

A subsequent study has confirmed that people with different attachment styles experience and express jealousy in qualitatively different ways.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"/&gt; Attachment thus plays an important role in jealous interactions by influencing the frequency and the manner in which attachments express jealousy.

===After love===
After dissolution of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief is a process which leads to the acceptance of loss and usually allows the person to move on. During this process people use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals tend to look for support, the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and pay more attention to the experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals  (Pistole, 1995).

===Same-sex relationships===
Ridge &amp; Feeney (1998) have studied a group of gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the frequency of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participants' relationship with their fathers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11323">'''Beat deafness''' is a form of congenital [[amusia]] characterized by a person's inability to distinguish musical [[rhythm]] or move in time to it.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=Bruce|title=A man lost in musical time|journal=[[Science News]]|date=26 March 2011|volume=179|issue=7|pages=9|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/70584/title/A_man_lost_in_musical_time|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Generally, humans have the ability to hear musical beat and rhythm beginning in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = L | year = 2011 | title = Characterizing congenital amusia | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 625–638 | doi=10.1080/17470218.2011.552730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, however, are unable to identify [[Beat (music)|beat]] and [[rhythm]] of [[music]], suffering from what is known as beat deafness.  Beat deafness is a newly discovered form of [[congenital amusia]], in which people lack the ability to identify or “hear” the beat in a piece of music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips-Silver | first1 = J. | last2 = Toiviainen | first2 = P. | last3 = Gosselin | first3 = N. | last4 = Piche | first4 = O. | last5 = Nozaradan | first5 = S. | last6 = Palmer | first6 = C. | last7 = Peretz | first7 = I. | year = 2011 | title = Born to dance but beat deaf: a new form of congenital amusia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 961–969 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most hearing impairments in which an individual is unable to hear any sort of sound stimuli, those with beat deafness are generally able to hear normally, but unable to identify beat and rhythm in music. Those with beat deafness are also unable to [[dance]] in step to any type of music. Even people who do not dance well can at least coordinate their movements to the song they are listening to, because they can easily keep time to the beat.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt;

==Rarity==
The first reported case of beat deafness was of a Canadian graduate student, whom researchers have identified as “Mathieu”.  Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) examined the human ability to recognize musical beat in a sample of individuals who had had no previous musical training in their lives. The researchers presented a series of songs from different genres and the participants were instructed to simply bounce up and down to the beat of the music. Results indicated that all participants except for Mathieu were able to move in sync with the beat of the music. The researchers also presented video clips which showed a person dancing to music. Mathieu could not identify when the person was or was not dancing in time to the music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Other participants demonstrated no problem with this task.

==Neural basis==
When [[sound waves]] reach the ears, the energy they contain is converted into electrical signals, which are sent via the [[auditory nerve]]s to the brain. Sound processing begins when these electrical signals reach the primary auditory receiving area in the core part of the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, E. B. (2010). Sensation and perception. California: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Signals then travel to the area surrounding the core, known as the belt area, and are then transmitted to the parabelt area, which is located next to the belt. Simple sounds such as [[pure tone]]s are able to activate the core area of the brain, but both the belt and parabelt areas are activated by only complex sounds, such as those found in [[speech]] and music.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; The [[auditory cortex]] in the left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for processing beat and rhythm in music. The right auditory cortex is primarily used in distinguishing between different [[harmonics]], which are simple pure tones that combine to create complex tones.&lt;ref name="Jourdain"&gt;Jourdain, R. (1997). Music, the brain, and ecstasy: How music captures our imagination. New York: William Morrow and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) propose that beat deafness is the result of neurological problems in the areas of the brain that are used for recognizing musical beat, rhythm, and time. The main area responsible for processing musical rhythm is the left auditory cortex,&lt;ref name="Jourdain"/&gt; however other areas are most likely involved as well. According to the hypothesis of Phillips-Silver and coworkers, it should therefore be functional abnormalities in the left auditory cortex that cause beat deafness.&lt;ref name="Honing"&gt;Honing, H. ([http://musiccognition.blogspot.com/2011/12/case-of-congenital-beat-deafness-part-2.html 2011]). A case of congenital beat deafness? Amsterdam: Music Matters | A blog on music cognition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of Mathieu’s brain appeared to be functioning normally, including the areas responsible for [[Auditory system|hearing]] in general and for [[motor control]], which is used in performing the moves in dancing.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Mathieu’s deficiencies are therefore not caused by the inability to hear efficiently or control the movement of his body while dancing. Beat deafness has also not been shown to affect other areas of [[cognitive function]] such as language, which does not involve any sort of underlying beat or sporadic rhythm changes that are associated with music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Given the normal functioning of Mathieu’s brain, the hypothesis about the beat perception deficit occurring in the brain area for rhythm processing in particular is most likely correct.

Beat deafness is however, a very recent discovery and further research is necessary in gaining complete understanding of the phenomenon and its underlying brain processes.&lt;ref name="Honing"/&gt; In 2016 a study was published that examined the neural correlates of beat perception in two beat-deaf individuals, Mathieu and Marjorie, and a group of control participants. It provided partial support for abnormalities in later cognitive stages of beat processing, reflected in an unreliable P3b component exhibited by Mathieu—but not Marjorie—compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26941591 | doi=10.3389/fnins.2016.00040 | volume=10 | title=Electrical Brain Responses to Beat Irregularities in Two Cases of Beat Deafness | pmc=4764698 | journal=Front Neurosci | pages=40 | last1 = Mathias | first1 = B | last2 = Lidji | first2 = P | last3 = Honing | first3 = H | last4 = Palmer | first4 = C | last5 = Peretz | first5 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to tone deafness==
[[Tone deafness]] is characterized by the inability to discriminate between different [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es, which are directly related to the [[frequencies]] of sound waves.&lt;ref name="Foxton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foxton | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Nandy | first2 = R.K. | last3 = Griffiths | first3 = T.D. | year = 2006 | title = Rhythm deficits in 'tone deafness' | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 24–29 | doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tone deafness is a related, but distinct disorder from beat deafness. People with tone deafness can recognize beat and can move in time to music, but they cannot perceive pitch. People with beat deafness on the other hand, can recognize and distinguish between different tones as well as the average person and can usually sing in tune, so musical pitch is not the issue.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Different areas of the brain in the auditory cortex are involved in the perception of musical pitch and melody, and researchers theorize that tone deafness can potentially be from any of these sections.&lt;ref name="Foxton"/&gt; Both beat deafness and tone deafness are derived from these same areas within the brain.

==Beat perception in animals==
[[File:Cacatua galerita Risdon.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s can detect the beat in music.]]
A research team led by Aniruddh D. Patel of [[The Neurosciences Institute]] concluded that [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s have the ability to perceive the beat in music and are able to rhythmically move to the tempo of the music as it changes.  Only vocal learning species such as dolphins and parrots are hypothesized to have the ability to perceive beat.  This is because beat perception and movement rely on complex vocal learning which require motor and auditory circuits in the brain. Vocal learning and beat perception do some overlapping in the parts of the brain that account auditory and motor areas. There is no significant evidence for beat perception in nonvocal learning species such as dogs and cats.&lt;ref name="Patel et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Iversen | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Bregman | first3 = M.R. | last4 = Schulz | first4 = I. | year = 2009 | title = Studying synchronization to a musical beat in nonhuman animals | url = http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2009readings/Patel_Iversen_Bregman_Schulz_NYAS_in_press.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | issue = 1| pages = 459–469 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04581.x | pmid=19673824}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[California sea lion]]s, a nonvocal learning animal, have demonstrated the ability to perceive beats in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Peter|last2=Rouse|first2=Andrew|last3=Wilson|first3=Margaret|last4=Reichmuth|first4=Colleen|title=A California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) can keep the beat: Motor entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli in a non vocal mimic.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0032345|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=127|issue=4|pages=412–427|doi=10.1037/a0032345|pmid=23544769|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common technology and alternate fuel available in the market for bi-fuel gasoline cars is [[Liquefied petroleum gas|Autogas (LPG)]], followed by [[Compressed natural gas|natural gas (CNG)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html | title=Natural Gas Vehicles | author=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center | publisher=US Department of Energy | date= | accessdate=2008-09-01 |language= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901201306/http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/natural_gas.html| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is used mainly in Europe. The Netherlands and the Baltic states have a large number of cars running with LPG. [[Italy]] currently has the largest number of CNG vehicles, followed by Sweden.  They are also used in [[South America]], where these vehicles are mainly used as [[taxicab]]s in main cities of [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the [[gas cylinder]] in the trunk and the LPG or CNG injection system and electronics.

==Diesel conversions==
Diesel engine is compression ignition engine and does not have spark plug. To operate a diesel engine with an alternate combustible fuel source such as [[Natural gas]], '''Dual-Fuel''' system used. Natural gas as the main fuel while [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] fuel is used for the ignition of the gas/air mixture inside the cylinder (a portion of diesel is injected at the end of the compression stroke, thereby maintaining the original diesel operation principle)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/8473/|title=Conversion method of a diesel engine to a CNG-diesel dual fuel engine and its financial savings|last=Mukhsin|first=Ismail, Muammar|last2=Hakim|first2=Zulkifli, Abd Fathul|date=April 2016|website=eprints.uthm.edu.my|access-date=2018-08-20|last3=Fawzi|first3=Mohd Ali, Mas|last4=Azmir|first4=Osman, Shahrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual fuel operation means the engine uses two fuels (gas and diesel)  at the same time, as opposed to Bi Fuel which would mean the engine could have the option of using either fuel separately.

There usually two type of conversions - low speed (below 1000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and high speed (between 1200 and 1800 RPM).

[[Image:Low speed conversion.jpg|thumb|Low Speed Conversion]]

===Low and middle speed conversion===
Gas is injected into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed as close to the suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines – within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.

* This conversion is adjusted for low speed engines up to 1000 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 70-90% natural gas for diesel or HFO.
* Gas is injected directly before intake valve by high speed electromagnetic injector, one or two injector per each cylinder.

=== High speed conversion===
[[Image:High speed conversion.jpg|thumb|High Speed Conversion]]

Gas is mixed with air by a common mixer installed before turbocharger(s). Gas flow is controlled by a throttle valve, which is electronically operated by the special control system according to the required engine output and speed. In order to avoid knocking of the engine, knocking detector/controller is installed, thus enabling engine operation at the most efficient gas/diesel ratio.

* Suitable for all High Speed engines, 1200-1800 RPM.
* System for conversion of industrial diesel engine to Bi-fuel operation by substitution of 50-80% natural gas for diesel.
* Gas and air are blended behind air filter before turbocharger by central mixer.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRwH9BF0h1w&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common conversion features==
{{prose|section|date=March 2017}}
* Substantial savings on operation costs
* Practically no engine modification required
* Non-derated output power
* Fuel flexibility: Possibility of bi-fuel or original pure diesel operations
* Safe operations.
* Lower emissions
* Longer engine life span, longer service and maintenance intervals

==Gas types used==
It is common to use [[Compressed Natural Gas|CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG (Liquid Natural Gas)]] for bi-fuel operations. Both are also mostly used for [[Electrical generator|Generator sets]] conversions, because the engine does not lose the output power.

In recent years [[biogas]] is being used. The [[biogas]] composition and calorific value must be known in order to evaluate if the particular biogas type is suitable. Calorific value may be an issue as biogas is derived from different sources and there is low calorific value in many cases. You can imagine you have to inject sufficient volume of gas into the cylinder to substitute [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil (or, better to say, substitute energy delivered by diesel oil). If the calorific value (energy) of the biogas was very low, there is a need to inject really big volume of biogas into the cylinder, which might be technically impossible. Additionally, the composition of the biogas has to lean towards ignitable gases and be filtered as much as possible of non-combustible compounds such as carbon dioxide.

Associated gas is the last type of gas which is commonly used for bi-fuel conversions of generator sets. Associated gas is a natural gas found in association with oil, either dissolved in the oil or as a cap of free gas above the oil. It means it has almost the same quality as CNG or LNG.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/halliburton-leads-effort-_n_3342119.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diesel/gas ratio==
It depends on the technical state of the engine, especially of the injection system. The typical Diesel / Gas ratio is 40/60% for the high-speed engines. If the operating output of the engine is constant and between 70-80% of nominal output, than it is possible to reach up to 30/70% ratio.&lt;ref&gt;http://hhpinsight.com/epoperations/2013/02/cummins-for-pge-universal-fracking/&lt;/ref&gt; If the operating output is lower (for example 50% of the nominal output) or if there are variations, the rate is about 45/55% (more of diesel is used).For Low Speed conversions it is possible to reach the Diesel/gas ratio up to 10/90%. Generally, it is not possible to guarantee an exact diesel/gas ratio without a test being done after the conversion.

== Vehicles ==
[[Aftermarket (automotive)|Aftermarket]] 'bi-fuel' and even 'tri-fuel' conversions are also available.

[[File:FortEdwardWindsorNovaScotiaCanada.JPG|thumb|Completed in 1750, [[Fort Edward (Nova Scotia)|Fort Edward]] in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] is the oldest remaining military blockhouse in [[North America]].]]
[[File:Donjon chateau a motte saint sylvain.jpg|thumb|upright|Reconstructed [[Europe]]an wooden [[keep]] at [[Saint-Sylvain-d'Anjou]], [[France]], has a strong resemblance to a [[North America]]n western frontier log blockhouse]]

In [[military science]], a '''blockhouse''' is a small [[fortification]], usually consisting of one or more rooms with [[Arrowslit|loopholes]], allowing its defenders to fire in various directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|authorlink1=Stephen C. Spiteri|title=Illustrated Glossary of Terms used in Military Architecture|journal=ARX Supplement|page=637|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/illustrated-glossary-of-military-architecture-terms.html|date=2010|publisher=MilitaryArchitecture.com|accessdate=2 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603174909/http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Journals/illustrated-glossary-of-military-architecture-terms.html#|archive-date=3 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually refers to an isolated fort in the form of a single building, serving as a defensive strong point against any enemy that does not possess [[Siege engine|siege equipment]] or, in modern times, [[artillery]], [[air force]] and [[cruise missile]]s. A fortification intended to resist these weapons is more likely to qualify as a [[Fortification|fortress]] or a [[redoubt]], or in modern times, be an underground [[bunker]]. However, a blockhouse may also refer to a room within a larger fortification, usually a [[artillery battery|battery]] or redoubt.

==Etymology==
The term "[[wikt:blockhouse|blockhouse]]" is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to [[Middle Dutch]] ''[[:nl:wikt:blokhus|blokhus]]'' and 18th-century French ''[[:fr:blocus|blocus]]'' (blockade).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=blockhouse (n.), blockade (n.)|work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blockhouses in ancient Greece ==
Blockhouses existed in ancient Greece, for example the one near [[Mycenae]] [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/146534.pdf]

== Early blockhouses in England ==
[[File:Mount Edgcumbe blockhouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Henry VIII of England|Henrican]] blockhouse at [[Mount Edgcumbe Country Park|Mount Edgcumbe]] near Plymouth, Devon, which is believed to date from ''circa'' 1545]]

Early blockhouses were designed solely to protect a particular area by the use of artillery, and they had accommodation only for the short-term use of the garrison. The first known example is the [[Cow Tower, Norwich]], built in 1398, which was of brick and had three storeys with the upper storeys pierced for six guns each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block1.htm|title=Definition of a Blockhouse|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605230950/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block1.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major period of construction was in the [[Device Forts|maritime defence programmes]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] between 1539 and 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block2.htm|title=Blockhouse dates|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231011/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block2.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built to protect important maritime approaches such as the [[Thames Estuary]], the [[Solent]], and [[Plymouth]]. Often sited in pairs, the blockhouses were not built to a common design, but usually consisted of a stone tower and [[bastion]] or gun platform, which could be semi-circular, rectangular or irregular in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block3.htm|title=Blockhouse general description|access-date=28 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231017/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/block3.htm#|archive-date=5 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last blockhouse of this type was [[Cromwell's Castle]], built in [[Scilly]] in 1651.

== Coastal fortifications in Malta ==
[[File:Tunnara museum.jpeg|thumb|Blockhouse of [[Westreme Battery]], built in 1715–16 in [[Mellieħa]], [[Malta]]]]

Blockhouses were an ubiquitous feature in [[Malta]]'s coastal fortifications built in the 18th century by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. Between 1714 and 1716, dozens of [[artillery batteries|batteries]] and [[redoubt]]s were built around the coasts of the Maltese Islands, while a few others were built in the subsequent decades. Almost every battery and redoubt had a blockhouse, which served as gun crew accommodation and a place to store munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiteri |first1=Stephen C. |authorlink1=Stephen C. Spiteri |title=ARX – Hospitaller Coastal Batteries |url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/Fortifications/18th-century-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html |website=MilitaryArchitecture.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hCdpHdya?url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/index.php/News/arx-hospitaller-coastal-batteries.html |archivedate=2 May 2016 |date=12 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the batteries consisted of a semi-circular or polygonal gun platform, with one or two blockhouses at the rear. The blockhouses usually had musketry loopholes, and in some cases were linked together by [[redan]]s. Surviving batteries include [[Mistra Battery]] and [[Ferretti Battery]], which both have two blockhouses, and [[Saint Mary's Battery]] and [[Saint Anthony's Battery]], which have a single blockhouse.

Many of the redoubts consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse at the rear, although a few had semi-circular or rectangular platforms. Surviving redoubts with blockhouses include [[Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq Redoubt]] and [[Briconet Redoubt]], both of which have a pentagonal plan. A few of the redoubts consisted of a single tower-like blockhouse without a platform, and were known as ''tour-reduits''. Of the four ''tour-reduits'' that were built, only the [[Vendôme Tower]] survives today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spiteri |first1=Stephen C. |authorlink1=Stephen C.

== Age of exploration ==
Originally blockhouses were often constructed as part of a large plan, to "block" access to vital points in the scheme. But from the [[Age of Exploration]] to the nineteenth century standard patterns of blockhouses were constructed for defence in frontier areas, particularly [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Richard|title=Blockhouses in Canada, 1749–1841: a Comparative Report and Catalogue|series= Occasional Papers in Archaeology and History, Canadian Historic Site|isbn=978-0-660-10298-6|year= 1980}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=W. Jerome D.|last2=Spence|first2=David L.|title=A History of Hickman County, Tennessee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIE7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271|year=1900|publisher=Southern Historical Press|isbn=978-0-89308-242-0|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockhouses may be made of [[masonry]] where available, but were commonly made from very heavy [[timber]]s, sometimes even [[Wooden log|logs]] arranged in the manner of a [[log cabin]]. They were usually two or even three [[Storey|floors]], with all storeys being provided with [[embrasure]]s or loopholes, and the uppermost storey would be roofed. If the structure was of timber, usually the upper storey would project outward from the lower so the upper storey defenders could fire on enemies attacking the lower storey, or perhaps pour water on any fires. When the structure had only one storey, its loopholes were often placed close to the ceiling, with a bench lining the walls inside for defenders to stand on, so that attackers could not easily reach the loopholes.

[[File:FortYork-Blockhouse.jpg|thumb|A 19th-century-era block house in [[Fort York]], Toronto]]

Blockhouses were normally entered via a sturdy, barred door at ground level. Most blockhouses were roughly square in [[plan]], but some of the more elaborate ones were [[hexagon]]al or [[octagon]]al, to provide better all-around fire. In some cases, blockhouses became the basis for complete forts, by building a [[palisade]] with the blockhouse at one corner, and possibly a second tower at the opposite corner. Many historical stone blockhouses have survived, and a few timber ones have been restored at historical sites. In New Zealand, the [[Cameron Blockhouse]], near [[Whanganui]], is one of the few blockhouses to survive from the [[New Zealand land wars]].

== Second Boer War ==
{{See also|Second Boer War#British response|l1=British response to Guerrilla warfare during the Second Boer War}}
[[File:Burgersdorp-Sentinel-001.JPG|thumb|Sentinel Blockhouse in [[Burgersdorp]]]]

During the [[Second Boer War]] the British forces built a large number of fortifications in [[South Africa]]. Around 441 were solid masonry blockhouses,&lt;ref name="SAMHJ01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomlinson|first=Richard|title=Britain's Last Castles – Masonry Blockhouses of the South African War, 1899–1902|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=The South African Military History Society|volume=10|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol106rt.html|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the construction of these blockhouses, but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone.

However the vast scale of British strategy led the British to develop cheaper, double-skinned corrugated iron structures.&lt;ref name="Blockhouses of the Boer War"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blockhouses of the Boer War |first=Mike |last=Hanslow |url=http://www.bwm.org.au/site/Blockhouses.php#iron|accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could be prefabricated, delivered to site by armoured train, and then have locally sourced rocks or rubble packed inside the double skin to provide improved protection.

A circular design developed by Major Rice in February 1901 had good all round visibility, and the lack of corners did away with the need for a substructure. Failure due to wood rot and splintering when hit by bullets or shrapnel were eliminated. The steel door to the blockhouse was sheltered by another piece of corrugated iron. The Major Rice blockhouse could be erected in six hours by six trained men. With the change from square gabled roofs to a circular design, they were given the nickname "Pepperpot blockhouse".&lt;ref name="Blockhouses of the Boer War" /&gt; With mass production the cost to build a blockhouse dropped down to £16, compared to several hundred pounds for masonry ones.

These blockhouses played a vital role in the protection of the railway lines and bridges that were key to the British military supply lines.&lt;ref name="SAMHJ01" /&gt;

== Concrete blockhouses ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gulf War]] --&gt;
During [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many types of blockhouses were built, when time allowed usually constructed of [[reinforced concrete]]. The major difference between a modern blockhouse and a [[bunker]] is that a bunker is constructed mostly below ground level while a blockhouse is constructed mostly above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;For the difference between blockhouses and bunkers see {{harvnb|Schneider|Kitchen|2002|p=87}}, {{harvnb|BACM Research|2009|p=209}}, {{harvnb|Davis|2007|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admiralty Citadel2008.jpg|thumb|The Admiralty Citadel in 2008]]

Some blockhouses like those constructed in England in 1940 were built [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|in anticipation of a German invasion]], they were often hexagonal in shape and were called "[[pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es". About 28,000 [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications]] were constructed of which about 6,500 still survive.&lt;ref name = dob_review &gt;{{cite web | title=A Review Of The Defence of Britain Project | work=Report | url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/projects/dob/review/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hochbunker Leitturm Augarten.jpg|thumb|upright|A German-built [[Flak tower|Flakturm]] (anti-aircraft tower) in the [[Augarten]] Vienna, Austria]]

In London the [[Military citadels under London#Admiralty Citadel|Admiralty Citadel]] is one of the most sturdy above ground structures built during World War II. It was constructed in 1940–1941 as a bomb-proof operations centre for the [[Admiralty]], with foundations nine metres deep and a concrete roof six metres thick. It too was intended to serve as a strongpoint in defending against the feared invasion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In Berlin and other cities during [[World War II]] some massive blockhouses were built as air-raid shelters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] platforms. They were called ''[[Hochbunker]]'' (literally, "high bunkers"; better translated as "above ground bunkers", to distinguish them from the usual deep i.e. underground air raid shelters) and those that functioned as anti-aircraft artillery platforms were also called [[Flak tower]]s. Some were over six stories high; several survive to this day because of the high cost of demolition. The {{Interlanguage link multi|Hochbunker Pallasstraße|de}} in Berlin-[[Schöneberg]] has a post-war block of flats built over it. During the [[Cold War]] the shelter was in use as a NATO foodstore.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the [[Guerrilla phase of the Irish Civil War]] (1922–1923), a network of blockhouses was constructed to protect the railways from guerrilla attacks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">'''Celibacy syndrome''' ({{lang-ja|セックスしない症候群}}, ''sekkusu shinai shōkōgun'') is a media hypothesis proposing that a growing number of Japanese adults have lost interest in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and have also lost interest in [[romantic love]], [[dating]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex |title=Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex? |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory has been reported by unknown members of "Japan's media" according to journalist Abigail Haworth of ''[[the Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Following the  report, the theory gained widespread attention in English media outlets in 2013,&lt;ref name="news.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/celibacy-syndrome-hits-japan-with-more-young-people-avoiding-sex/story-fnet0gt3-1226743585472 |title=Celibacy syndrome hits Japan with more young people avoiding sex |publisher=News.com.au |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently refuted by several journalists and bloggers.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yutaaoki.com/blog/top5-mistakes-journalists-make-about-sexless-japan |title=Top 5 Mistakes Journalists Make about Sexless Japan |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/23/are_japanese_people_really_having_less_sex_than_anyone_else.html |publisher=Slate.com |title=No, Japanese People Haven’t Given Up on Sex |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suckers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ampontan.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/suckers/ |title=Suckers |date=3 February 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="firstthings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/10/news-flash-yuko-and-hiro-do-not-despise-sex/ |title="Yuko and Hiro" Do Not Despise Sex |date=13 October 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2013/10/23/yes-japanese-people-still-have-sex/ |title=Don’t worry.

==Reports and causes==
In addition to [[celibacy]], the theory cites declining numbers of marriages and declining birthrates in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  According to surveys conducted by the Japan Association for Sex Education, between 2011 and 2013, the number of female college students reporting to be [[Virginity|virgins]] increased.  Additionally, surveys conducted by the Japanese Family Planning Association (JFPA) indicated a high number of Japanese women who reported that they "were not interested in or despised sexual contact".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Meanwhile, surveys conducted by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in Japan in 2008 and 2013, revealed that the number of Japanese men and women reporting to not be in any kind of romantic relationship grew by 10%.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.com"/&gt;

The theory attributes two possible causes for these reports:  the past two decades of economic stagnation as well as high gender inequality in Japan.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Criticism==
One critic accused ''The Guardian'' and other media outlets of using "cherry-picked" data in order to make a sensational claim that appeals to Western notions of a "weird Japan".&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt; Another criticism points to contrary statistics that indicate that Japanese youth are having sex more frequently than ever.&lt;ref name="washpo"/&gt; Additionally, one of the surveys on which the theory is based has been criticized as having a statistically invalid [[Sample size determination|sample size]]. In that survey, only 60 respondents (aged 16 to 19) claimed an aversion to sex, and merely 126 respondents were used to represent the young Japanese population (aged 16 to 19),&lt;ref name="suckers"/&gt; which was nearly 6 million in 2014.&lt;ref name="pop_stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/tsuki/ |title=Population Estimates by Age (5-Year Age Group) and Sex |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism points out that, while the theory conflates sexlessness with low birthrate, these have been demonstrated by others to be uncorrelated.&lt;ref name="yutaaoki"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1688">The '''Center for Mathematical Modeling''' (CMM) was created in 2000 to encompass research and training activities that were being conducted by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering at [[Universidad de Chile]]. Today, it features a range of activities from fundamental research in applied mathematics to industry-oriented research and education. The Center is a base for international collaboration; it hosts an increasing number of engineering and Ph.D. students as well as postdoctoral fellows, and provides a scientific counterpart to their industrial partners.

==Origins==
The CMM was founded by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering (DIM) at the Universidad de Chile with the aid of a FONDAP-[[CONICYT]] project. From its inception, the Center was an associated international unit of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), the first in mathematics outside France. The CMM is physically housed in the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Science, which contains the oldest, most prestigious and productive engineering school in [[Chile]]. As a consequence the Center has a strong link with departments in this school -industrial, mechanical, civil, electrical, computer science and earth science- and benefits from access to the 4.000 strong student population of the school and to more than 500 graduated students in diverse fields and engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">In [[cognitive science]], association by '''contiguity''' is the principle that ideas, memories, and experiences are linked when one is frequently experienced with the other. For example, if you constantly see a knife and a fork together they become linked (associated). The more these two items (stimuli) are perceived together the stronger the link between them. When one of the memories becomes activated later on, the linked (contiguously associated) memory becomes temporarily more activated and thus easier to be called into working memory. This process is called ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]],'' and the initial memory that primed the other is called the ''retrieval cue.''

Association by contiguity is the root of association by similarity. Association by similarity is the idea that one memory primes another through their common property or properties. Thus, an apple may prime a memory of a rose through the common property of red. These two become associated even though you may have never experienced an apple and a rose together (consistent with association by contiguity).

In the study of human memory, the contiguity effect has been found in studies of free recall.  Analyses of free recall data indicates that there tends to be the greatest number of +/- 1 transitions between words, suggesting that a person is more likely to recall words together that are closer together in a list.&lt;ref name="Syracuse University"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sederberg, Howard &amp; Kahana|title=A context-based theory of recency and contiguity in free recall|url=http://memory.syr.edu/papers/SedeEtal08.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown in a graph of conditional response probability as a function of lag as originated by Dr. Michael Kahana.  The probability of recall (y-axis) is plotted against the lag, or separation between subsequently recalled words.&lt;ref name=Kahana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahana|first=Michael|last2=Howard |last3=Zaromb |last4=Wingfield|title=Age dissociates recency and lag-recency effects in free recall|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2001}} See also figure http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/File:Crp2a_square.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if two items A and B are learned together, when cued with B, A is retrieved and vice versa due to their temporal contiguity, although there will be a stronger forward association (when cued with A, B is recalled).&lt;ref name=Kahana/&gt;

The contiguity effect appears relatively constant, and has been predicted to have long-term effects according to the temporal context model proposed by Howard and Kahana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|author2=Kahana|title=A distributed representation of temporal context|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|year=2002|volume=46|pages=269–299|doi=10.1006/jmps.2001.1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains the contiguity effect in the following manner:  when an item is presented, it activates the temporal context that was active when the item was originally studied.  Since contexts of neighboring items overlap, and that overlap increases with decreasing lag between items, a contiguity effect results.&lt;ref name="Syracuse University"/&gt; The contiguity effect has even been found between items in different lists, although it has been speculated that these items could simply be intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|last2=Youker |last3=Venkatadass|title=The persistence of memory: Contiguity effects across hundreds of seconds|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=2008|volume=1|issue=15|pages=58–63|doi=10.3758/pbr.15.1.58 |pmc=2493616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When one associated memory, a group of associated memories, or a whole line of associated memories becomes primed, this is known as [[spreading activation]].

In [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]], contiguity refers to how associated a [[reinforcement|reinforcer]] is with behaviour. The higher the contiguity between events the greater the strength of the behavioural relationship.

[[Edwin Ray Guthrie]]'s contiguity theory deals with patterned movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/contiguity-theory.html Instructional Design Theories]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

|quote= Gruenewald was a "cynologist" (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Five quotes are used in the Wiktionary to justify inclusion of the word cynology/cynologist.
*''1892, The Journal of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary Archives, 'Professor Mills has done excellent work in his course on "Cynology, the Dog and his Diseases," a subject hitherto only taught incidentally in any college ...'''
*''1948, Dogs In Britain Clifford L.B. Hubbard, MacMillan &amp; Co, 'Buffon's table is here reproduced as it was a sincere attempt towards laying a foundation upon which cynologists might work out the origin of breeds and their varieties and the analysis of dog groups.'''
*''1951, The American Mercury, 'Students of cynology can trace in the dictionary the dog's remarkable rise in the public esteem in this century.'''
*''1985, The Complete Dog Book, published by the American Kennel Club, 'The annals of cynology make no further mention of the breed until 1901 when a combined Rottweiler and Leonberger Club was formed.'''
*''1990, Austin Farrer, in his introduction to G. W. Leibniz’ "Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil"; quoted in Charles Taliaferro’s 2005 Evidence and Faith ([http://www.bored.com/ebooks/Religion/about%20religion%20and%20ethics/theodicy.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423062037/http://www.bored.com/ebooks/Religion/about%20religion%20and%20ethics/theodicy.html |date=2008-04-23 }}) 'Now neither probatology nor cynology could hope to be universal — the world is not all sheep nor all dog: it would have to be hylology;'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Cynology is a classical compound word (from [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κύων}}, ''kyōn'', [[genitive]] {{lang|grc|κυνός}}, ''kynos'', "dog"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') referring to the study of [[dog]]s.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch ''kynologie'', and the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''кинология'', from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|''*ḱwon-''}}, which is the source of ''hound''.

κυν is also the source of the English word ''cynic'', and is directly related to ''canine'' and ''hound''.

== Usage in English ==
The suffix '-logy' in [[English language|English]] words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.

== The study of dogs ==
Studies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by [[biologist]]s, [[geneticist]]s, [[zoologist]]s, [[ethology|behaviourist]]s, and others [[Science|scientist]]s, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.

Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, [[Dog breeding|breeders]], [[Dog trainer|trainers]], [[Police dog|police dog handlers]], [[Pet Psychic|animal communicators]] and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.
Those who, very rarely, refer to themselves as "cynologists", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, [[Dog breed|breed]] development, dog [[Dog behavior|behavior]] and training, and the literature and history of dogs.

== Usage in other languages ==
Cynology may have other connotations or uses in languages other than English, see German [[:de:Kynologie|Kynologie]], Dutch [[:nl:Kynologie|Kynologie]] and Czech [[:cs:Sportovní kynologie|Sportovní kynologie]].

The very rare term ''cynologist'' in English, is generally found to refer to "canine specialists" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and [[Professional handler|professional dog-handlers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Domestication theory''' is an approach in [[science and technology studies]] and [[media studies]] that describe the processes by which innovations, especially new [[technology]] is 'tamed' or appropriated by its users. First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.
The theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life.  It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.

One variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. 

The Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by [[Science and technology studies]], [[gender studies]] of household technology, sociology of [[everyday life]], consumption studies and [[innovation]] studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.

As a strand of the [[Social shaping of technology]] approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work  links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).

Domestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and [[ethnography]] to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.

The principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers.  However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much  more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as [[Technology acceptance model]]) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17510">'''Ecopsychology''' studies the relationship between human beings and the natural world through [[ecology|ecological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] principles.&lt;ref name="And"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=G.|title=About eco-psychology.|url=http://www.eco-psychology.com/pages/about_ecopsychology.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field seeks to develop and understand ways of expanding the emotional connection between individuals and the natural world, thereby assisting individuals with developing sustainable lifestyles and remedying alienation from nature. [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] is credited with coining the term in his 1992 book, ''The Voice of the Earth,'' although a group of psychologists and environmentalists in Berkeley, including Mary Gomes and Allen Kanner, were independently using the term to describe their own work at the same time. Roszak, Gomes and Kanner later expanded the idea in the 1995 anthology ''Ecopsychology.'' Two other books were especially formative for the field, [[Paul Shepard]]'s 1982 volume, "Nature and Madness," which explored the effect that our ever-diminishing engagement with wild nature had upon human psychological development, and philosopher [[David Abram]]'s ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' published in 1996. The latter was the first widely read book to bring phenomenology to bear on ecological and ecopsychological issues, examining in detail the earthly dimensions of sensory experience, and disclosing the historical effect of formal writing systems upon the human experience of nature's agency, voice, and interiority.

A central premise of ecopsychology is that while today the human mind is affected and shaped by the modern social world, its deep structure is inevitably adapted to, and informed by, the more-than-human natural environment in which it evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roszak|first=Theodore|title=A new therapy [Letter to the editor]|journal=BioScience|year=1995|volume=45|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.2307/1312526}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]] of biologist [[E.O. Wilson]], human beings have an innate instinct to connect emotionally with nature,&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E. O.,|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|year=1995|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the aspects of nature that recall what evolutionary psychologists have termed the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptiveness]], the natural conditions that the [[human species]] evolved to inhabit.

The field of ecopsychology extends beyond the conventional purview of psychology, which had traditionally considered the psyche to be a matter of relevance to humans alone. Ecopsychology examines why people continue environmentally damaging behaviour, and to develop methods of positive motivation for adopting sustainable practices.&lt;ref name="The"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roszack|first=Theodore|title=The nature of sanity|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199601/the-nature-sanity|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that many environmentally damaging behaviours are addictive at some level, and thus are more effectively addressed through positive emotional fulfillment rather than by inflicting shame. Other names used to refer to ecopsychology include depth ecology, Gaia psychology,&lt;ref name="Gai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Psychology|url=http://www.gaiapsychology.org/|publisher=Gaia Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychoecology, ecotherapy, [[environmental psychology]], green psychology, [[transpersonal ecology]], global therapy, green therapy, Earth-centered therapy, reearthing, nature-based psychotherapy, shamanic counselling, [[ecosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schroll|first=M. A.|author2=Walker, H.|title=Diagnosing the human superiority complex: Providing evidence the eco-crisis is born of conscious agency [Abstract]|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|year=2011|volume=22|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sylvan therapy.

==Practical benefits==

Certain researchers propose that an individual's connection to nature can improve their interpersonal relationships and emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Gai" /&gt; An integral part of this practice is to remove [[psychotherapy]], and the individual, from the interior of office buildings and homes and place them outdoors.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt; According to the precepts of ecopsychology, a walk in the woods or a city park is refreshing because it is what humans evolved to do. Psychologists such as Roger Ulrich, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, Frances Kuo and others have studied the beneficial effects of inhabiting natural settings and of looking at pictures of landscapes on the human psyche. [[Richard Louv]]'s ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]: Saving our Children from [[Nature deficit disorder|Nature-Deficit Disorder]]'' discusses in detail how the exposure of children to nature can assist in treating mental disorders, including [[attention deficit disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=James|title=Product Review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56512-391-5|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=March 8, 2012|format=Review of book Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder|date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community psychologist [[Guy Holmes (psychologist)|Guy Holmes]]' Walk and Talk groups have helped people with serious mental health diagnoses alongside other members of the general public to access the benefits of walking in green spaces in UK towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology in the Real World: Community-based group work|last=Holmes|first=G.|publisher=PCCS|year=2010|isbn=978-1-906254131|location=Ross-on-Wye|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardening is one way to experience the practical benefits of connecting with nature, particularly in the contexts of stress reduction, restoration, and awareness. Initial experimental research about stress-relieving effects showed subjects who gardened after situations of acute stress were able to fully recover from the event and their cortisol level measurements indicated positive mood increases after gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Den Berg|first=Agnes|last2=Custers|first2=Mariëtte|date=|title=Gardening Promotes Neuroendocrine and Affective Restoration from Stress|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3-11|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological benefits of interactions with nature appear intensified at a smaller, more compressed scale in gardens, offering an accessible, fast-paced view of plant life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Rachel|date=|title=Some Psychological Benefits of Gardening|url=|journal=Environment and Behavior|volume=5|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the practice of domestic gardening can improve sense of [[self-efficacy]] across ages, particularly among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milligan|first=Christine|last2=Gatrell|first2=Anthony|last3=Bingley|first3=Amanda|date=|title=‘Cultivating health’: therapeutic landscapes and older people in northern England|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=58|issue=9|pages=1781-1793|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists are also interested in the ways plants influence attention and healing. Plants are attributed as sources of positive distraction, shifting the focus from sensations of discomfort to aesthetic properties of plants, which creates perceived alleviation of pain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grinde|first=Bjørn|last2=Patil|first2=Grete Grindal|date=|title=Biophilia: Does Visual Contact with Nature Impact on Health and Well-Being?|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=6|issue=9|pages=2332-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have the opportunity to reconnect with nature through horticultural practices and in the wilderness can restore perceived sense of social connection, joy, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Paul|date=|title=Embedment in the environment: A new paradigm for well-being?|url=|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=130|issue=6|pages=265-269|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interacting with nature is a practical preventative measure against mental-health issues that stem from [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]]. When a group of participants in one study went on a walk in nature they expressed lower levels of rumination and showed diminished neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex, an area tied to mental illness, while participants who walked through urban settings experienced no changes in either respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bratman|first=Gregory|last2=Hamilton|first2=J. Paul|last3=Hahn|first3=Kevin|last4=Daily|first4=Gretchen|last5=Gross|first5=James|date=|editor5-first=|title=Nature experience reduces rumination and subgenual prefrontal cortex activation|url=|journal=National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=28|pages=8567-8572|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another premise of ecopsychology is that steps taken to accept and notice nature can sharpen the senses and help people cultivate new skills. For example, the ability to track and navigate through a wilderness is improved if nature is noticed and accepted rather than feared. Similarly, ecopsychology proposes that sailors who appreciate the sea gain a keen sense for breeze directions. Psychologists have explored how senses subtly influence the brain in natural environments and impact a person's subjective well-being. Plants in the visual sphere affect the brain whether or not they are the object of focus and the blue and green hues of nature may contribute to low-anxiety psychological states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco|first=Lara|last2=Shanahan|first2=Danielle|last3=Fuller|first3=Richard|date=|title=A Review of the Benefits of Nature Experiences: More Than Meets the Eye|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons to embrace nature==

Ecopsychology explores how to develop emotional bonds with [[nature]].&lt;ref name="And" /&gt; It considers this to be worthwhile because when nature is explored and viewed without judgement, it gives the sensations of harmony, balance, timelessness and stability. Ecopsychology largely rejects [[reductionist]] views of nature that focus upon rudimentary building blocks such as [[genes]], and that describe nature as selfish and a struggle to survive. Ecopsychology considers that there has been insufficient scientific description and exploration of nature, in terms of [[wildness]], [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], [[spirituality]] and emotional ties. For example, parsimony is the best way to produce an evolutionary tree of the species ([[cladistics]]), suggesting that parsimonious adaptations are selected. Yet today, the brain is often seen as complicated and governed by inherited mind modules, rather than being a simple organ that looks for parsimony within the influences of its surroundings, resulting in the compaction in minds of a great diversity of concepts.

==Cultures that embrace nature==

In its exploration of how to bond with nature, ecopsychology is interested in the examples provided by a wide variety of ancient and modern cultures that have histories of embracing nature. Examples include [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]], [[pagan]], [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] cultures, as well as [[shamanism]] and the more recent [[hesychast]] tradition. Of interest is how identity becomes entwined with nature, so that loss of those sacred places is far more devastating to indigenous people than often understood. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] stories, in particular, illustrate a socially recognized sense of community between humans and the natural landscape.&lt;ref name=Out&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=H. J.|title=Review|year=2009|publisher=MELUS|pages=194–196|accessdate=March 8, 2012|format=Review of the book Out of the Shadow: Ecopsychology, Story, and Encounters With the Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Māori people|Māori]] philosophy, and practice of kaitiakitanga, or eco-guardianship, and preservation emphasizes a deep connect between humans, and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kaitiakitanga-guardianship-and-conservation/page-1 Te Ara Encycolopedia - Understanding kaitiakitanga]&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Orthodox monks led a contemplative life deeply intertwined with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ongal.bg/en/hesychast.html Bulgarian Hesychasts]&lt;/ref&gt; Other lessons include how to live sustainably within an environment and the self-sacrifices made to tolerate natural limits, such as population control or a nomadic existence that allows the environment to regenerate. Moreover, certain indigenous cultures have developed methods of psychotherapy involving the presence of trees, rivers, and astronomical bodies.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;

==Pain and delusions without nature==

Ecopsychologists have begun detecting unspoken grief within individuals, an escalation of pain and despair, felt in response to widespread environmental destruction. The field of ecopsychology intends to illustrate how environmental disconnection functions as an aspect of existing [[pathology|pathologies]], without creating a new category. The contention is that if a culture is disconnected from nature, then various aspects of an individual's life will be negatively impacted.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt; It also believes that without the influence of nature, humans are prone to a variety of delusions, and that to some degree life in the wild forms the basis for human sanity and optimal psychological development. The topic is explored in detail [[Paul Shepard]]'s book ''Nature and Madness''. It is also proposed that separation from outdoor contact causes a loss of sensory and information-processing ability that was developed over the course of human evolution, which was spent in direct reciprocity with the environment.&lt;ref name="Gai" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16436">The term '''emotional literacy''' has often been used in parallel to, and sometimes interchangeably with, the term [[emotional intelligence]]. However, there are important differences between the two. Emotional literacy was noted as part of a project advocating humanistic education in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lotecka, L. (1974) A project advocating humanistic education: An evaluation of its effect on public school teachers. Journal of Drug Education, 4(2), 141-149.  Available at http://elguides.cc/AProject.pdf (accessed April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==

The term was used extensively by [[Claude Steiner]] (1997)&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;Steiner, C. with Perry, P. (1997) Achieving Emotional Literacy. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt; who says:

Emotional literacy is made up of 'the ability to understand your [[emotions]], the ability to listen to others and [[empathise]] with their emotions, and the ability to express emotions productively. To be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you. Emotional literacy improves relationships, creates loving possibilities between people, makes co-operative work possible, and facilitates the feeling of community.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt;{{rp|11}}

Steiner breaks emotional literacy into 5 parts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Knowing your feelings.
#Having a sense of [[empathy]].
#Learning to manage our emotions.
#Repairing [[emotional problem]]s.
#Putting it all together: emotional interactivity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having its roots in [[counseling]], it is a social definition that has interactions between people at its heart.  According to Steiner emotional literacy is about understanding your feelings and those of others to facilitate relationships, including using dialogue and self-control to avoid negative arguments.  The ability to be aware and read other people's feelings enables one to interact with them effectively so that powerful emotional situations can be handled in a skillful way.  Steiner calls this "emotional interactivity". Steiner's model of emotional literacy is therefore primarily about dealing constructively with the emotional difficulties we experience to build a sound future. He believes that personal power can be increased and relationships transformed. The emphasis is on the individual, and as such encourages one to look inward rather than to the social setting in which an individual operates.

==British context==

In Britain, the term 'emotional literacy' is often used and has developed, building on the work of Steiner and Goleman&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than [[IQ]]. London: Bloomsbury.&lt;/ref&gt;  as a social construction – as opposed to the more individualistic 'emotional intelligence' with the attempts to measure it as if emotions were measurable in a relatively rational way.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"&gt;Boler, M. (1999) Feeling power: emotions and education. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"&gt;Matthews, G., Zeidner, M. and Roberts, R. D. (2004) Emotional intelligence: science and myth. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"&gt;Burman, E. (2009) Beyond 'emotional literacy' in [[Women's studies|feminist]] and [[educational research]], [[British Educational Research Association|British Educational Research Journal]], 35(1): 137-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators did not like the way that 'emotional intelligence' focused so much on the individual and there were clear attempts to avoid the narrow EQ tests that were in use for two reasons:
#The idea of an EQ test had resonance with discredited{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=December 2015}} [[psychometric measure]]s of intelligence such as [[IQ test]]s.
#People were also concerned with the way that pupils could be subject to even more control through the introduction of emotional intelligence into the [[curriculum]].&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, G. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] in England and Wales emphasized a range of cognitive skills that were controlled through exams. Educators saw the need to expand the range of skills that pupils required and were also concerned with [[social inclusion]]. The Labour  Government provided an overarching rationale for this with its promotion of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2007) The Children's Plan: Building brighter futures. London: Department for Children, Schools and Families.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DfCSF (2008) Indicators of a school's contribution to well-being. London: Ofsted&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when the [[Department of Children, Schools and Families]] developed a scheme for schools – called the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) – it was  based on Goleman's definition of [[emotional intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"&gt;Goleman, D. (1996) Emotional Intelligence. Why it can matter more than IQ. London: Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"&gt;Department for Education and Skills (2007) Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning for secondary schools (SEAL) Introductory Guide. Ref: 00043-2007DWO-EN-04  London: HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence any distinctions between the terms emotional intelligence and emotional literacy were blurred. Even so, key educators in Britain continued to use the term emotional literacy. Emotional literacy took on an aspect that was concern with personal growth. For example, the importance of developing relationships is, to a degree, in Weare's definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ability to understand ourselves and other people, and in particular to be aware of, understand, and use information about the emotional states of ourselves and others with competence. It includes the ability to understand, express and manage our own emotions, and respond to the emotions of others, in ways that are helpful to ourselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;Weare, K. (2003) Developing the emotionally literate school. London: Paul Chapman. p2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, the organization Antidote&lt;ref&gt;Antidote (2010) Definition of Emotional Literacy. Available at http://www.antidote.org.uk/learning/about.php (accessed April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; defined emotional literacy as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
the practice of interacting with others in ways that build understanding of our own and others' emotions, then using this understanding to inform our actions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions acknowledge both the individual and other people and so [[inter-personal relationships]] and the need for dialogue are included. Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, P. (2001) Nurturing Emotional Literacy. London: David Fulton.&lt;/ref&gt; has taken a broad approach to emotional literacy in a Local Education Authority (LEA) where he considers its development is important for teachers as well as pupils.

However, there was still an underlying assumption about the individual and how they develop as if they were culturally isolated and separate from factors such as religion and gender.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt; Also, the development of emotional literacy was justified by arguing that its introduction would help to improve other factors such as behavior, [[attendance]] and [[academic achievement]]. Boler&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;  researched four of the emotional programs in America. She pointed out that the programs tended to view pupils as individuals who are in need of development through enabling them to control their impulses. This can mean that pupils are to become responsible for their own control and that other social factors can be ignored. It is possible that these programs can open the way for greater control of pupils with even their emotions being assessed.
On the one hand the development of emotional literacy programs can be seen as progressive, but on the other the focus seems quite inward, as there is little reference leading to any broader concept of social and political reform.&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;

In the same way that Goleman&lt;ref name="Goleman, D. 1996"/&gt; discusses emotional intelligence educational programs, emotional literacy programs can also be more about coping with the social and political status quo in a caring, interactive and emotionally supportive environment than with any systematic attempt to move beyond it to social improvement.

==Culturally situated==

Matthews (2006)&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt; argues against the concept of 'emotional intelligence' and for a developed definition of 'emotional literacy'.  His starting point is that all social and emotional interactions take place in a cultural context and that generally all emotions are felt because of interactions with other people.
He argues that a group may, for example, contain men and women and people from a range of ethnicities. One could judge a person's emotional literacy by observing what they brought to the situation, the way they interacted and the degree to which they showed empathy, and, the recognition of "self" and "others". The way that one can reliably gauge the emotional literacy of a person is to see them interacting in a group and see how they behave towards other people of different genders, sexuality and social class.  Hence, it makes little sense to talk about emotional literacy of a person as if it were separate from such factors – someone may be able to empathize with people of their own sex, but not different sexualities or religions. Also, one may think that they can empathize with the other sex, or another religion, but the other person may not agree with them. Indeed, the views of other people are essential in deciding upon such factors.  There is always a social context and in any context power differentials operate.  Any form of paper and pen test will only give access to what a person thinks, not to the important view of how others think.  For example, many men (and women) would say that they were not sexist, yet a person from the opposite sex may not agree. A person cannot tell how well they, say, empathize, only other people tell them if they are. A manager may think they are self-confident, open and friendly, but others find him or her aggressive and [[bullying]].

Hence, according to Matthews, emotional literacy is a social process that takes place in a social setting, is something that is never really achieved, and has to be seen in conjunction with others. This indicates that key components of emotional literacy, which is a continual process, that includes dialogue, [[Ambiguity tolerance|acceptance of ambiguity]] and the ability to reflect. Judgments are made on a person's individual-in-group emotional literacy.  He argues:

{{quote|text=Emotional literacy involves factors such as people understanding their own and others' emotional states; learning to manage their emotions and to empathize with others. It also includes the recognition that emotional literacy is both an individual development and a collective activity and is both about self-development and the building of community so that ones own sense of emotional well-being grows along with that of others, and not at their expense. Emotional literacy involves connections between people and working with their differences and similarities while being able to handle ambiguity and contradiction. It is a dynamic process through which the individual develops emotionally and involves culture and empowerment. For example, it includes understanding how the nature of social class, 'race' and gender (sexism and homophobia) impinge on peoples' emotional states to lead to an understanding of how society could change. Hence it incorporates an understanding of power exchanges between people and a challenging of power differentials.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2006) Engaging Education. Developing Emotional Literacy, Equity and Co-education. Buckingham: McGraw-Hill/Open University Press. pp178&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On this view emotional literacy is developed to help people understand themselves, others and the power connections between them. Matthews links emotional literacy to equality and social justice. Emotional literacy is not just to be "nice", but also to know when to stand up for viewpoints and fight for a case. It is not about more control over people, but less. As McIntosh and Style&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, P. and Style, E. (1999) Social, Emotional and Political Learning, in Cohen, J. (ed.) Educating Minds and Hearts. Social and Emotional Learning and the Passage into Adolescence. New York: Teachers College. p137&lt;/ref&gt; argue schools are always involved in social, emotional and power relations, yet "power relations are a taboo subject in K-12 schooling and in the majority culture of the United States. Power relations are therefore little understood systemically. Students, however, learn about power by watching, by imitating, by avoidance of what they fear".

==In education==

In general, most of the criticisms of courses to promote pupils' emotional development have been directed at those that develop emotional intelligence. For example, there are the courses developed in the USA and Britain.&lt;ref name="Skills 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casel (2003) Safe and Sound. An educational leader's guide to evidence-based social and emotional learning programs. Chicago: University of Chicago Press  (Available at: www.casel.org/downloads/Safe%20and%20Sound/1A_Safe_&amp;_Sound.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elias, M., Zins, J., Weissberg, R. and Frey, K. (1997) Promoting Social and Emotional Learning. Virginia USA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt; The critiques of these courses include that:
# Emotional intelligence/literacy courses can lead to more control over pupils with them being more defined in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Boler, M. 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burman, E. 2009"/&gt;
# The assessment of emotional intelligence/literacy can lead to pupils being labeled as inadequate.
# Emotional intelligence courses can locate problems in the individual that are also a function of how society is organised.
# When courses are taught it is often assumed that pupils are emotionally ready to deal with what is on the curriculum, whereas they may not be.
# The whole agenda of teaching emotional development can lead to pupils being seen as deficit in emotional control and so can depress their  potential to have faith in future goals&lt;ref&gt;Ecclestone, K. and Hayes, D. (2008) The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Emotional intelligence courses have moral and ethical aspects that are not made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Rietti, S. (2009) Emotional intelligence and moral agency: Some worries and a suggestion, Philosophical Psychology, 22(2): 143-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews has tried to avoid some of the difficulties.  For example, his strategies for the classroom mean that pupils only develop when, and in what areas, they are able.  Emotional development between the genders has been the focus of research&lt;ref name="Matthews, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. (2004) Promoting emotional literacy, equity and interest in KS3 science lessons for 11- to 14-year-olds; the 'Improving Science and Emotional Development' project, International Journal of Science Education, 26(3): 281-308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B., Kilbey, T., Doneghan, C. and Harrison, S. (2002) Improving attitudes to science and citizenship through developing emotional literacy, School Science Review, 84(307): 103-114.&lt;/ref&gt; with a small reference to 'race'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, B. and Sweeney, J. (1997) Collaboration in the science classroom to tackle racism and sexism, Multi-cultural Teaching, 15(3): 33-36.&lt;/ref&gt; But these are limited in strategies and do not tackle fully the critiques.

'''Endophysics''' literally means “[[physics]] from within”. It is the study of how the observations are affected and limited by the observer being within the universe. This is in contrast with the common '''exophysics''' assumption of a system observed from the “outside”. The term ''endophysics'' has been coined by [[David Finkelstein]] in a letter to the founder of the field [[Otto E. Rössler]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">An '''enthymeme''' ({{lang-el|ἐνθύμημα}}, ''enthumēma'') is a rhetorical [[syllogism]] (a three-part deductive [[Logical argument|argument]]) used in oratorical practice. Originally theorized by [[Aristotle]], there are four types of enthymeme, at least two of which are described in Aristotle's work.&lt;ref name="Benoit1982"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = The Most Important Passage in Aristotle's Rhetoric
  | journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly
  | volume = 12
  | issue = 1
  | pages = 2-9
  | date = Winter 1982
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle referred to the enthymeme as "the body of proof", "the strongest of rhetorical proofs...a kind of syllogism" (''Rhetoric'' I.I.3,11). He considered it to be one of two kinds of proof, the other of which was the [[paradeigma]]. Maxims, Aristotle thought to be a derivative of enthymemes. (''Rhetoric'' II.XX.1)

== Syllogism with an unstated premise ==
The first type of enthymeme is a truncated syllogism, or a syllogism with an unstated premise. 

Here is an example of an enthymeme derived from a syllogism through truncation (shortening) of the syllogism:
*"'''[[Socrates]] is mortal because he's human'''."

:The complete ''formal'' syllogism would be the classic:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise – unstated)
::Socrates is human. ([[minor premise]] – stated)
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion – stated)

While syllogisms lay out all of their premises and conclusion explicitly, these kinds of enthymemes keep at least one of the premises or the conclusion unstated.

== Syllogism based on signs == 

In the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle argues that some enthymemes are derived from syllogisms that are based on signs (''semeia'') instead of absolute facts. In this context, signs are "things [that] are so closely related that the presence or absence of one indicates the presence or absence of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaking.pitt.edu/student/public-speaking/reasoning.html|title=Reasoning|date=2008-08-21|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are given below. 

*"'''He is ill, since he has a cough.'''"
*"'''Since she has a child, she has given birth.'''"

In the examples, 'having a cough' and 'having a child' are signs of illness and giving birth respectively. In both cases the enthymeme is only probably true because there are other sources of coughs and children besides pathogens and parturition respectively, such as allergies and adoption.

== Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise ==

The third kind of enthymeme consists of a syllogism with a missing premise that is supplied by the audience as an unstated assumption. In the words of rhetorician William Benoit, the missing premise is: "assumed by rhetor when inventing and by audience when understanding the argument."&lt;ref name="Benoit1987"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = On Aristotle's Example
  | journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric
  | volume = 20
  | issue = 4
  | pages = 261-267
  | date = 1987
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this kind of enthymeme is as follows: 
*"'''''[[Candide]]'' is a typical French novel; therefore it is vulgar.'''"

In this case, the missing term of the syllogism is "French novels are vulgar" and might be an assumption held by an audience that would make sense of the enthymematic argument. Such unstated premises can also rise to the level of axioms (statements so commonly accepted as to be thought universally true).

== Visual enthymemes ==

Another kind of enthymeme is the visual enthymeme. Scholars have argued that words are not the only form of expression that can be understood to form enthymematic arguments. Pictures can also function as enthymemes because they require the audience to help construct their meaning.&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite journal

  | first = Valerie
  | authorlink = 
  | title = Aristotle’s Classical Enthymeme and the Visual Argumentation of the Twenty First Century
  | journal = Argumentation and Advocacy

  | volume = 37
  | pages = 133-149
  | date = 2001
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Some scholars argue that our understanding of the enthymeme has evolved over time and is no longer representative of the enthymeme as originally conceived by Aristotle. This is obviously true of the visual enthymeme, only conceived in the early twenty-first century and may also be true of the enthymeme as truncated syllogism. Carol Poster argues that this later interpretation of the enthymeme was invented by British rhetoricians such as [[Richard Whately]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Poster2003"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10171">'''Ethnoarchaeology''' is the [[ethnographic]] study of peoples for [[archaeology|archaeological]] reasons, usually through the study of the material remains of a society (see David &amp; Kramer 2001).  Ethnoarchaeology aids archaeologists in reconstructing ancient lifeways by studying the material and non-material traditions of modern societies. Ethnoarchaeology also aids in the understanding of the way an object was made and the purpose of what it is being used for.&lt;ref name=paullane&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Paul|title=Barbarous Tribes and Unrewarding Gyration? The Changing Role of Ethnographic Imagination in African Archaeology|publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologists can then infer that ancient societies used the same techniques as their modern counterparts given a similar set of environmental circumstances.

One good example of ethnoarchaeology is that of [[Brian Hayden]] (1987), whose team examined the manufacture of [[Mesoamerican]] [[quern-stone]]s, providing valuable insights into the manufacture of [[prehistoric]] quern-stones. Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture.  In the best cases, these studies have involved long term ethnographic fieldwork (for example, Herbich 1987, Kramer 1997, Deal 1998, Dietler &amp; Herbich 1998, Hinshaw 2000, Longacre &amp; Skibo 2000, Kohn 2010).

==Origins and development==
Although [[ethnography]] has long been used by archaeologists to draw analogies to the past, ethnographic data is not gathered with specifically archaeological goals in mind. Ethnoarchaeology developed as a response to the feeling among archaeologists that ethnography did not adequately answer their own specific research questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiles|first1=Daniel|title=Ethnoarchaeology: A Discussion of Methods and Applications|journal=Man|date=1977|volume=12|issue=1|pages=87–89|jstor=2800996|doi=10.2307/2800996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American archaeologist [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] first mentioned the "ethno-archaeologist" in 1900, and encouraged archaeologists to conduct their own ethnographic field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fewkes|first1=Jesse|title=Tusayan Migration Traditions|date=1901|publisher=Washington Government Printing Office|location=Washington|page=579|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924104075415|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread acceptance of ethnoarchaeology as a true subdiscipline of archaeology did not emerge until the late 1950s and 1960s, as archaeologists began to explore the different scientific applications it might have.
Ethnoarchaeology today has become a widely accepted research practice, with a few archaeologists even identifying as "ethnoarchaeologists" rather than simply "archaeologists." &lt;ref name="Kramer and David"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David|first1=Nicholas|last2=Kramer|first2=Carol|title=Ethnoarchaeology in action|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521667798|pages=6–31|edition=Digitally repr., with corr.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogy==
Analogy in archaeology is, essentially, applying observed behavior to non-observed behavior. It is perhaps one of the most used research tools in archaeological interpretation. Analogies can best be drawn between those cultures who share similar environments. More importantly, these cultures must interact with their habitats in ways that are comparable to one another.&lt;ref name=ascher&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ascher|first1=Robert|title=Analogy in Archaeological Interpretation|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|date=Winter 1961|volume=17|issue=4|pages=317–325|jstor=3628943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that analogies can only provide clues and not sound, definitive answers to research questions. For this reason, G.S. McCall calls for a comparative view for analysis in his cross-cultural study of the Gamo and Konso of  southern and central Ethiopia, the Siberian Chukchi, highland New Guinea, highland Maya of Guatemala and Mexico, central, northern, and western arid regions of Australia, the Tjmba of northern Namibia, and the Xeta of Amazonia and their uses of lithics.&lt;ref&gt;McCall, G. S. (2012). Ethnoarchaeology and the organization of lithic technology. Journal of Archaeological Research, 20(2), 157-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal Analogies===
Formal analogies are made with the assumption that, as Paul Lane describes, "because two objects or contexts share a similar appearance or shape, they are likely to share other properties as well, typically that of function."&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt; One of the major issues with this approach is that often these objects or contexts that initially appeared similar may have been used for very different purposes or served different functions. Perhaps the different objects were even created differently. In a 1971 study, Gould and his team compared working edge angle of Mousterain Quina scrapers and modern Western Desert Aboriginal scrapers and found the Mousterain angles to be steeper.  Gould reasoned this was due to the Western Desert Aborigines retouching the scrapers further than the Hominids of the Mousterian. Gould et al. concluded that this method of studying ethnographic tool use for comparison could be employed to determine what tools were used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gould|first1=R. A.|last2=Koster|first2=D. A.|last3=Sontz|first3=H. L.|title=The Lithic Assemblage of the Western Desert Aborigines of Australia|journal=American Antiquity|date=1971|volume=36|issue=2|pages=149–169|doi=10.2307/278668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relational Analogies===
Relational analogies are opposite from formal analogies. Instead of just drawing the conclusions, one must prove the relationship, and both sides of the analogy are studied and a relationship must be demonstrated between the ethnographic object and the archaeological object.&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt;

==Direct Historical Approach==
One popular method in ethnoarchaeology is the use of the [[direct historical approach]]. This approach relies on living cultures that may be closely genetically or spatially related to the archaeological culture of interest in order to form analogies that may be used to explain findings. Gould and his team explains how archaeologists should be able to measure the degree of differences between the tools found with the ethnographic material and the artifacts &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gould|first1=Richard|last2=Koster|first2=Dorothy|last3=Sontz|first3=Ann|journal=American Antiquity|date=1971|volume=36|issue=2|pages=149–169|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/278668?uid=3739960&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104933076403|accessdate=October 10, 2014|doi=10.2307/278668|title=The Lithic Assemblage of the Western Desert Aborigines of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this technique may be useful it is important to note that it does not account for cultural change over time.&lt;ref name="paullane"/&gt; The "folk cultural approach" is the Old World equivalent to this and the term may be used in place of the [[direct historical approach]].&lt;ref name="ascher"/&gt;

==Issues==
[[Ethnography]] can provide insights of value to archaeologists into how people in the past may have lived, especially with regard to their social structures, religious beliefs and other aspects of their culture. However, it is still unclear how to relate most of the insights generated by this anthropological research to archaeological investigations. This is due to the lack of emphasis by anthropologists on the material remains created and discarded by societies and on how these material remains vary with differences in how a society is organised.

This general problem has led archaeologists (for example, London &lt;nowiki&gt;[2000]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to argue that [[anthropology|anthropological]] work is not adequate for answering archaeological problems, and that archaeologists should therefore undertake ethnoarchaeological work to answer these problems. These studies have focused far more on the manufacture, use and discard of tools and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and have sought to answer such questions as what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in [[midden]]s or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.

Another issue often faced in ethnoarchaeology is the potential for a single archaeological situation to have multiple possible analogies drawn from it. A process of elimination must take place to narrow down all of the possibilities until the best solution can be discovered.&lt;ref name="ascher"/&gt;

'''Fluency''' (also called '''volubility''' and '''eloquency''') is the property of a [[person]] or of a [[system]] that delivers [[information]] quickly and with [[expertise]].

== Language use ==
{{further|Language proficiency}}Language fluency is one of a variety of terms used to characterize or measure a person's language ability,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|last=González|first=Josué M.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781412937207|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in conjunction with accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58970182|title=Analysing learner language|author=Ellis, Rod|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Barkhuizen, Gary Patrick.|isbn=0194316343|location=Oxford|oclc=58970182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no widely agreed-upon definitions or measures of language fluency,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Francine|title=What do we mean by fluency?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00046-8|journal=System|volume=25|issue=4|pages=535–544|doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(97)00046-8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; someone is typically said to be fluent if their use of the [[language]] appears ''fluid'', or natural, coherent, and easy as opposed to slow, halting use.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; In other words, fluency is often described as the ability to [[Language production|produce language]] on demand and be understood.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

Varying definitions of fluency characterize it by the language user’s automaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=R.|date=1992|title=Psychological mechanisms underlying second language fluency|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=14|pages=357–385|via=|doi=10.1017/s0272263100011189}}&lt;/ref&gt; their speed and coherency of language use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual differences in language ability and language behavior|last=Fillmore|first=C. J.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the length and rate of their speech output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennon|first=P|date=1990|title=Investigating fluency in EFL: A quantitative approach|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=40|pages=387–417|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1990.tb00669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories of automaticity postulate that more fluent language users can manage all of the components of language use without paying attention to each individual component of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaBerge|first=D|last2=Samuels|first2=S. J.|date=1974|title=Toward a Theory of Automatic Information Process in Reading|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=6|pages=293–323|via=|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, fluency is achieved when one can access language knowledge and produce language unconsciously, or automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Pages/smallbook.aspx|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|website=www.nichd.nih.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019055748/https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Pages/smallbook.aspx|archivedate=2017-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt; Theories that focus on speed or length and rate of speech typically expect fluent language users to produce language in real time without unusual pauses, false starts, or repetitions (recognizing that some presence of these elements are naturally part of speech).&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt; Fluency is sometimes considered to be a measure of [[Linguistic performance|performance]] rather than an indicator of more [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] language knowledge, and thus perception and understandability are often key ways that fluency is understood.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:

* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

# Intermediate fluency
# Advanced fluency.

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

Both disorders have breaks in the fluidity of speech, and both have the fluency breakdown of repetition of parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65617513|title=Stuttering and cluttering : frameworks for understanding and treatment|last=9-|first=Ward, David, 1956 December|date=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841693347|location=Hove [England]|oclc=65617513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PeterFendi Erotic Scene.jpg|thumb|right|Two couples in a foursome. [[Painting]] by [[Peter Fendi]].]]
A '''foursome''' is a form of [[group sex]] involving four people of any gender combination.

==Types of foursomes==
The level of sexual activity among the four members may vary greatly. Other foursomes may involve some same sex contact, and some foursomes actively involve all four members.

===Wife Swapping===
'''Wife swapping''' Involves two couples, usually both married heterosexual pairs, where each man ''swaps'' his wife for the other, and has sexual intercourse with her. There is usually no sexual contact between the two wives or the two husbands. Although this act is named for married couples, it applies equally to unmarried and homosexual couples. Wife swapping is sometimes simply called "swapping" as some people find the term "wife swapping" degrading to women and implies treating them as objects.

===Soft Swinging===
'''Soft swinging''' involves two couples, where either one couple has a [[voyeurism|voyeuristic]] role watching the other have sex, or the couples each have sex but with no sexual contact between the two pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Swinging for Beginners | first=Kaye | last=Bellemeade | publisher=New Tradition Books | year=2003 | isbn=0-9728473-4-0 | pages=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Freak Nation: A Field Guide to 101 of the Most Odd, Extreme, and Outrageous American Subcultures | first=Kate | last=Stevens | publisher=Adams Media | year=2010 | isbn=1-4405-0646-9 | page=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gangbangs===
{{main|Gang bang}}
A '''gang bang''' involves three (or more) people having sex with a fourth successively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gangbangs and drive-bys: grounded culture and juvenile gang violence | series=Social problems and social issues | first=William B. | last=Sanders | publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=1994 | isbn=0-202-30537-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually occurs with men penetrating women, but can equally apply to homosexual acts, or women penetrating men using [[Strap-on dildo]]s.

===Airtight seal===
The ''airtight seal'' involves [[sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]] and [[anal sex]] performed on a woman by two men in a [[List of sex positions#Multiple_penetration|double penetration]], while the woman performs [[fellatio]] on a third man.

===Quads===
A '''quad''' is a [[Romantic love|romantic relationship]] involving four people. It is most commonly used to describe a love relationship between two couples where it takes the form of a [[Square (geometry)|square]], in which all four people have a love relationship with each other.

While it can refer to two people independently romantically linked with two others, it usually implies that each of the four people has some kind of [[sexual relationship]] to the other three. The relationships are normally friendships, though romantic. Addition of [[bisexuality|bisexual]] or [[homosexual]] characters adds many possible combinations of sexes, and of romantic and sexual interactions.

'''Gender variance''', or '''gender nonconformity''', is behavior or [[gender expression]] by an individual that does not match masculine or feminine [[gender norms]]. People who exhibit gender variance may be called ''gender variant'', ''gender non-conforming'', ''gender diverse,'' ''gender atypical''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haldeman|first=Douglas C.|date=2000-01-01|title=Gender Atypical Youth: Clinical and Social Issues|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254744524_Gender_Atypical_Youth_Clinical_and_Social_Issues|journal=School Psychology Review|volume=29|issue=2|pages=192–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[genderqueer]]'', and may be [[transgender]] or otherwise variant in their [[gender identity]].

Mission statement, available on the front page of the group's website: www.gender.org&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''gender-variant'' is deliberately broad, encompassing such specific terms as ''[[transsexual]]'', [[Butch and femme|''butch'' and ''femme'']], ''[[Drag queen|queen]]'', ''[[sissy]]'', ''[[tomboy]]'', ''[[travesti]]'', or ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.

The word ''[[transgender]]'' usually has a narrower meaning and somewhat different connotations, including an identification that differs from the [[sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. [[GLAAD]] (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation)'s Media Reference Guide defines ''transgender'' as an "umbrella term for people whose gender identity or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth."&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition. Transgender Glossary of Terms”], ‘’[[GLAAD]]’’, USA, May 2010. Retrieved on 2011-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all gender variant people identify as transgender, and not all transgender people identify as gender variant — many identify simply as men or women. [[Gender identity]] is one's internal sense of their own gender; while most people have a gender identity of a boy or a man, or a girl or a woman, gender identity for other people is more complex than two choices. Furthermore, gender expression is the external manifestation of one's gender identity, usually through "masculine," "feminine," or gender variant presentation or behavior.&lt;ref name="GLAAD"/&gt;

In some countries, such as Australia, the term ''gender diverse'' or, historically, ''sex and/or gender diverse'', may be used in place of, or as well as ''transgender''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Childhood gender variance==
{{Main|Childhood gender nonconformity}}

Multiple studies have suggested a correlation between children who express gender non-conformity and their eventually coming out as [[homosexuality|gay]], [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|title=Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84169-018-6|pages=201–2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=roychiRaM8gC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Childhood%20Gender%20Nonconformity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some studies, a majority of those who identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]] self-report gender non-conformity as children.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt; However, the accuracy of these studies have been questioned, especially within the academic community.&lt;ref name="Brookley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookley|first=Robert|title=Reinventing the Male Homosexual: The Rhetoric and Power of the Gay Gene|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34057-3|pages=60–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZrXrqaDfwoC&amp;lpg=PT54&amp;pg=PT54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapeutic community is currently divided on the proper response to childhood gender non-conformity. One study suggested that childhood gender non-conformity is [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman |first=RC|title=Sexual Orientation and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Sexual Science and Clinical Practice |year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12057-9|pages=53–7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mwtokhymV_4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22Childhood+Gender+Nonconformity%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Childhood%20Gender%20Nonconformity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it is heavily associated with homosexuality, gender nonconformity is more likely to predict [[child abuse|childhood abuse]]. A recent study illustrated that heterosexuals and homosexuals alike who do not express their gender roles according to society are more likely to experience [[physical abuse|abuse physically]], [[sexual abuse|sexually]], and [[psychological abuse|psychologically]].&lt;ref&gt;"Andrea L. Roberts, Margaret Rosario, Heather L. Corliss, Karestan C. Koenen and S.Bryn Austin"[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/02/15/peds.2011-1804.full.pdf "Childhood Gender Nonconformity: A Risk Indicator for Child Abuse and Posttraumatic Stress in Youth"],''Pediatrics Official Journal of the American Acamedy of Pediatrics'', February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also been conducted about adults' attitudes towards nonconforming children. There are reportedly no significant generalized effects (with the exception of few outliers) on attitudes towards children who vary in gender traits, interests, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R. N., &amp; Blakemore, J. (2013). Adults' attitudes about gender nonconformity in childhood. Archives Of Sexual Behavior, 42(3), 399-412. doi:10.1007/s10508-012-0023-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who are gender variant may struggle to conform later in life. As children get older and are not treated for the "mismatch" from mind and bodily appearance, this leads to discomfort, and negative self-image and eventually may lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or [[suicide]], or [[self-doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep03/children.aspx|title=Understanding children's atypical gender behavior|last=Crawford|first=Nicole|date=2003|website=American Psychological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child is not conforming at a very young age, it is important to provide family support for positive impact to family and the child.&lt;ref&gt;Peate, I. (January 01, 2008). Understanding key issues in gender-variant children and young people. British Journal of Nursing (mark Allen Publishing), 17, 17, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Children who do not conform prior to age 11 tend to have an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation as a young adult.&lt;ref name="Roberts, A. 2013"&gt;Roberts, A., Rosario, M., Slopen, N., et al. (2013). Childhood gender nonconformity, bullying victimization, and depressive symptoms across adolescence and early adulthood: an 11-year longitudinal study. J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 52(2): 143-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts et al. (2013) found that of participants in their study aged between 23 and 30, 26% of those who were gender nonconforming experienced some sort of depressive symptoms, versus 18% of those were gender conforming.&lt;ref name="Roberts, A. 2013"/&gt; There is no curative treatment for gender non conformity, however behavioral therapy has been reported to be successful, such as recognition and open discussions, or counseling sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Snaith, P (1998). Gender dysphoria. Journal of Continuing Professional Development, 4: 356-359&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for gender identity disorders (GID) such as gender variance have been a topic of controversy for three decades.&lt;ref name=zach&gt;Hill, D., Rozanski, C., Carfagnini, J., &amp; Willoughby, B. (January 01, 2007). Gender identity disorders (GID) in childhood and adolescence. International Journal of Sexual Health, 19, 1, 57-75&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of Hill, Carfagnini and Willoughby (2007), Bryant (2004), "suggests that treatment protocols for these children and adolescents, especially those based on converting the child back to a stereotypically gendered youth, make matters worse, causing them to internalize their distress." In other words, treatment for GID in children and adolescents may have negative consequences.&lt;ref name=zach/&gt; Studies suggest that treatment should focus more on helping children and adolescents feel comfortable in living with GID. There is a feeling of distress that overwhelms a child or adolescent with GID that gets expressed through gender.&lt;ref name=zach/&gt; Hill et al. (2007) states,  "if these youth are distressed by having a condition deemed by society as unwanted, is this evidence of a disorder?". Bartlett and colleagues (2000) note that the problem determining distress is aggravated in GID cases because usually it is not clear whether distress in the child is due to gender variance or secondary effects (e.g., due to ostracization or stigmatization).&lt;ref name=zach/&gt; Hill et al. (2007) suggests, "a less controversial approach, respectful of increasing gender freedom in our culture and sympathetic to a child’s struggle with gender, would be more humane."&lt;ref name=zach/&gt;

==Social status for men vs. women==
Gender nonconformity among people assigned male at birth is usually more strictly, and sometimes violently, [[gender policing|policed]] in the West than is gender nonconformity among people assigned female at birth. However, a spectrum of types of gender nonconformity exists among boys and men. Some types of gender nonconformity, such as being a [[stay-at-home father]], may pass without comment whereas others, such as wearing lipstick and skirts, may attract stares, criticism, or questioning of the non-conforming person's [[sanity]], from intolerant people. Some geographical regions are more tolerant than others of such differences.

This is a comparatively recent development in historical terms, because the dress and careers of women used to be policed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/uhic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?query=&amp;prodId=UHIC&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;limiter=&amp;disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;zid=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CCX3468301237&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=sand55832&amp;jsid=ff1c546a17b62d2d1ce4007351b97724| title=Working women in the 1930s| accessdate=21 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still are in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia (where they are ''literally'' policed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/60339/nine-things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia| title=Seven things women in Saudi Arabia cannot do| work=[[The Week]] UK| date=27 Sep 2016| accessdate=21 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iran/local-laws-and-customs|title=Iran travel advice|publisher=UK government| accessdate=21 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The success of [[second-wave feminism]] is the chief reason for the freedom of women in the West to wear traditionally-male clothing such as [[trousers]], to take up traditionally-male occupations such as being a [[medical doctor]], etc. At the other extreme, some [[Communist]] regimes such as the [[Soviet Union]] made a point of pushing women into traditionally male occupations in order to advance the [[state feminism|feminist ideology of the state]] {{emdash}} for example, 58% of Soviet engineers were women in 1980 {{emdash}} but this trend went into reverse after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a reversal that some attribute to women becoming more free to follow their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.asee.org/public/conferences/20/papers/6985/view| title=The Decline of Women in Russian Engineering Education| year=2013 |conference=ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition |first1=Svetlana|last1=Barabanova|first2=Phillip|last2=Sanger|first3=Julia| last3=Ziyatdinova | first4=Anastasia| last4=Sokolova| first5=Vasiliy| last5=Ivanov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atypical gender roles==
An atypical gender role is a [[gender role]] comprising gender-typed behaviors not typically associated with a [[cultural norm]].{{Disputed inline|text=No, it's not. |Atypical gender role is an oxymoron|date=October 2017}} Gender role stereotypes are the socially determined model which contains the cultural beliefs about what the gender roles should be.  It is what a society expects men and women to think, look like, and behave.  Gender role stereotypes are often based on gender norms.

Examples of some atypical gender roles:

* ''[[Househusband]]s'': men who stay at home and take care of the house and children while their partner goes to work. According to Sam Roberts of the [[New York Times]], in 1970 four percent of American men earned less than their wives. [[National Public Radio]] reported that by 2015 this had risen to 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/08/384695833/what-happens-when-wives-earn-more-than-husbands |title=What Happens When Wives Earn More Than Husbands |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=February 8, 2015 |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Metrosexual]]'': a man of any sexual orientation who has interest in style and fashion and dresses well.
* ''[[Androgynous]] people'': identifying as neither male nor female; OR presenting a gender either mixed or neutral
* ''[[Crossdresser]]'': a person who dresses in the clothing and approximating the appearance of members of the opposite gender, in public or solely in private, without proclaiming themselves to be that gender. Cross dressers may be cisgender, or they may be trans people who have not yet transitioned.
* ''[[Hijra (India)|Hijra]]'': A (sometimes neutered) person whose anatomy is in most cases identified as male (more rarely female or intersex), but whose gender identity is neither masculine nor feminine, whose gender role includes special clothing that identifies them as a hijra, and whose gender role includes a special place in society and special occupations.
* ''[[Khanith]]'': The gynecomimetic partner in a heterogender homosexual relationship, who may retain his public status as a man, despite his departure in dress and behavior from a socio-normal male role. The clothing of these individuals must be intermediate between that of a male and a female. His social role includes the freedom to associate with women in the entire range of their social interactions, including singing with them at a wedding. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Association with sexual orientation==
Gender norms vary by country and by culture, as well as across historical time periods within cultures. For example, in [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribes in Afghanistan, adult men frequently hold hands, without being perceived as gay, whereas in the West this behavior would, in most circumstances, be seen as proof of a homosexual relationship. However, in many cultures, behaviors such as crying, an inclination toward caring for and nurturing others in an emotionally open way, an interest in domestic chores other than cooking, and excessive self-grooming can all be seen as aspects of male gender non-conformity.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley"/&gt; Men who exhibit such tendencies are often stereotyped as gay. Studies found a high incidence of gay males self-reporting gender-atypical behaviors in childhood, such as having little interest in athletics and a preference for playing with [[doll]]s.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;[[J. Michael Bailey]], Joseph S. Miller, Lee Willerman; Maternally Rated Childhood Gender Nonconformity in Homosexuals and Heterosexuals, Archives of Sexual Behavior, Vol. 22, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found that mothers of gay males recalled such atypical behavior in their sons with greater frequency than mothers of heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; But while many gay or bisexual men exhibit traditionally feminine characteristics, some of them do not, and not all feminine men are necessarily gay or bisexual.

For women, adult gender non-conformity is often associated with lesbianism due to the limited identities women are faced with at adulthood.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley"/&gt; Notions of heterosexual womanhood often require a rejection of physically demanding activities, social submission to a male figure (husband or boyfriend), an interest in reproduction and homemaking, and an interest in making oneself look more attractive for men with appropriate clothing, make-up, hair styles and body shape. A rejection of any of these factors may lead to a woman being called a lesbian regardless of her actual sexual orientation, or indeed to a man "crossing her off the list" as a potential romantic or sexual partner regardless of whether he actually believes she is a lesbian. Therefore, attracting a male romantic or sexual partner can be a strong factor for an adult woman to suppress or reject her own desire to be gender variant. 

Lesbian and bisexual women, being less concerned with attracting men, may find it easier to reject traditional ideals of womanhood because social punishment for such transgression is not effective, or at least no more effective than the consequences of being openly gay or bisexual in a [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society (which they already experience). This may help account for high levels of gender nonconformity self-reported by lesbians.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookley"/&gt;

Gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], in her essay ''Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory'', states: "Discrete genders are part of what humanizes individuals within contemporary culture; indeed, those who fail to do their gender right are regularly punished. Because there is neither an 'essence' that gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=1988-01-01|title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=519–531|doi=10.2307/3207893|jstor=3207893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler argues that gender is not an inherent aspect of identity, further stating, "...One might try to reconcile the gendered body as the legacy of sedimented acts rather than a predetermined or foreclosed structure, essence or fact, whether natural, cultural, or linguistic".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Clothing==
Among adults, the wearing of [[women's clothing]] by men is often socially stigmatized and [[sexual fetishism|fetishised]], or viewed as sexually abnormal. However, [[cross-dressing]] may be a form of gender expression and is not necessarily related to erotic activity, nor is it indicative of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. [http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender ‘’GLAAD Media Reference Guide, 8th Edition. Transgender Glossary of Terms”], ‘’[[GLAAD]]’’, USA, May 2010. Retrieved on 2011-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Other gender-nonconforming men prefer to simply modify and stylise men's clothing as an expression of their interest in appearance and [[fashion]].

==Gender-affirmative practices ==
Gender-affirmative practices recognize and support an individual's unique gender self-identification and expression. Gender-affirmative practices are becoming more widely adopted in the mental and physical health fields in response to research showing that clinical practices that encourage individuals to accept a certain gender identity can cause psychological harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Karl |title=Making gender identity disorder of childhood: Historical lessons for contemporary debates |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |date=September 2006 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=23–39 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2006.3.3.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[American Psychological Association]] published gender-affirmative practice guidelines for clinicians working with transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Preliminary research on gender-affirmative practices in the medical and psychological settings has primarily shown positive treatment outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guidelines for psychological practice with transgender and gender nonconforming people. |journal=American Psychologist |date=2015 |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=832–864 |doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these practices become more widely used, longer-term studies and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to continue to evaluate these practices. 

Research has shown that youth who receive gender-affirming support from their parents have better mental health outcomes than their peers  who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=Caitlin |last2=Russell |first2=Stephen T. |last3=Huebner |first3=David |last4=Diaz |first4=Rafael |last5=Sanchez |first5=Jorge |title=Family Acceptance in Adolescence and the Health of LGBT Young Adults |journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nursing |date=November 2010 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=205–213 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6171.2010.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gender-affirmative practices emphasize gender health. Gender health is an individual's ability to identify as and express the gender(s) that feels most comfortable without fear of rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hidalgo |first1=Marco A. |last2=Ehrensaft |first2=Diane |last3=Tishelman |first3=Amy C. |last4=Clark |first4=Leslie F. |last5=Garofalo |first5=Robert |last6=Rosenthal |first6=Stephen M. |last7=Spack |first7=Norman P. |last8=Olson |first8=Johanna |title=The Gender Affirmative Model: What We Know and What We Aim to Learn |journal=Human Development |date=2013 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=285–290 |doi=10.1159/000355235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender-affirmative practices are informed by the following premises:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hidalgo |first1=Marco A. |last2=Ehrensaft |first2=Diane |last3=Tishelman |first3=Amy C. |last4=Clark |first4=Leslie F. |last5=Garofalo |first5=Robert |last6=Rosenthal |first6=Stephen M. |last7=Spack |first7=Norman P. |last8=Olson |first8=Johanna |title=The Gender Affirmative Model: What We Know and What We Aim to Learn |journal=Human Development |date=2013 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=285–290 |doi=10.1159/000355235}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* gender variance is not a psychological disorder or mental illness

In [[music]], a '''ghost note''' is a [[musical note]] with a [[rhythm]]ic value, but no discernible [[pitch (music)|pitch]] when played. In [[musical notation]], this is represented by an "X" for a [[note head]] instead of an oval, or parentheses around the note head.&lt;ref&gt;" [http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/1377-false_note False note]", ''OnMusic Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with the X-shaped notation that raises a note to a [[Sharp (music)|double sharp]].

On [[stringed instrument]]s, this is played by sounding a [[mute (music)|muted]] string. "Muted to the point where it is more percussive sounding than obvious and clear in pitch. There is a pitch, to be sure, but its musical value is more rhythmic than melodic or harmonic...they add momentum and drive to any bass line."&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt; Occurring in a [[rhythm]]ic [[figure (music)|figure]], they are purposely deemphasized, often to the point of near [[silence]]. In [[popular music]] drumming, these notes are played, "very softly between the 'main' notes," (off the [[beat (music)|beat]] on the [[sixteenth note]]s) most often on the [[snare drum]] in a [[drum kit]].&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;Mattingly, Rick (2006). ''All About Drums'', p.61. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|1-4234-0818-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost notes are often used by [[electric bass]] players and [[double bass]] players in a range of popular music and traditional music styles. In vocal music, it represents words that are spoken in rhythm rather than sung.

==Terminology==
Ghost notes are also called "dead notes", "muted notes", "silenced notes" or "false notes".

==Instrumental music==
Ghost notes, however, are not simply the unaccented notes in a pattern. The unaccented notes in such a pattern as a clave are considered to represent the mean level of emphasis—they are neither absolutely emphasized nor unemphasized. If one ''further'' deemphasizes one of these unaccented notes to the same or a similar extent to which the accented notes in the pattern are emphasized, then one has 'ghosted' that note. In a case in which a ghost note is deemphasized to the point of silence, that note then represents a rhythmic placeholder in much the same way as does a [[rest (music)|rest]]. This can be a very fine distinction, and the ability of an instrumentalist to differentiate between what is a ghost note and what is a rest is governed largely by the acoustic nature of the instrument.

[[Wind instrument]]s, including the human voice, and [[guitar]]s are examples of instruments generally capable of ghosting notes without making them synonymous with rests, while a [[pianist]] or [[percussionist]] would have more difficulty in creating this distinction because of the percussive nature of the instruments, which hampers the resolution of the volume [[gradient]] as one approaches silence. However, in such a case as that the ghost notes were clearly audible, while being far less prominent than the unaccented notes which represent the mean degree of emphasis within the example, then a percussionist could be said to create what we might define as ghost notes.

A frequent misconception is that [[grace note]]s and ghost notes are synonymous. A grace note is by definition decidedly shorter in length than the principal note which it 'graces', but in many examples the grace note receives a greater degree of accentuation (emphasis) than the principal itself, even though it is a much shorter note than the principal. In other words, while a grace note could be ghosted, the ghosting of notes is a function of volume{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} rather than of duration.

In drumming, a ghost note is played at very low volume,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAnyNHCDmWYC&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=ghost+note+drumming&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u8aeUuLnHNe_sQSkmILIBQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20drumming&amp;f=false | title=The Drum Set Crash Course | publisher=Alfred Music Publishing | author=Miller, Russ | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically on a [[snare drum]].&lt;ref name=drum /&gt; In musical notation, ghost notes are indicated in parenthesis surrounding the note.&lt;ref name=drum /&gt; According to ''The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco'', the purpose of a ghost note is to "...be heard under the main sound of the groove. This produces a subtle 16th-note feel around a strong back beat or certain accents."&lt;ref name=drum&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7S68Hq5nLoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA11-IA2&amp;dq=ghost+note+drumming&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u8aeUuLnHNe_sQSkmILIBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20drumming&amp;f=false | title=The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco | publisher=See Sharp Press |author1=Barry, Mick  |author2=Gianni, Jason | year=2004 | pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''ghost note'', then, can have various meanings. The term '''''[[anti-accent]]''''' is more specific. Moreover, there exists a set of anti-accent marks to show gradation more specifically.
Percussion music in particular makes use of anti-accent marks, as follows:

#slightly softer than surrounding notes: ◡ (breve)
#significantly softer than surrounding notes: ( ) (note head in parentheses)
#much softer than surrounding notes: [ ] (note head in square brackets)

Examples can be heard in the drumming of [[Harvey Mason]], [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]], [[Bernard Purdie]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=Q7S68Hq5nLoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA17-IA6&amp;dq=bernard+purdie&amp;hl#v=onepage&amp;q=bernard%20purdie&amp;f=false Gianni, Jason (2003) ''The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco'', p. 35.

=== Stringed instruments ===
[[Image:Bass ghost note groove.png|thumb|400px|''Bass'': Ghost notes indicated by 'x' shaped note heads.&lt;ref name="Stuff"&gt;Letsch, Glenn (2008). ''Stuff! Good Bass Players Should Know'', p.51-52. {{ISBN|978-1-4234-3138-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Bass ghost note groove.mid|Play}}]]

A [[guitarist]] wishing to ghost a note can decrease the pressure the fretting hand is exerting upon the strings without removing the hand from the fretboard (which would result in the sounding of the open pitches of those strings). This is sometimes called a 'scratch', and is considered a ghost note unless all the unaccented notes in the pattern were 'scratched' (in which case the scratches are unaccented notes).

On the [[double bass]] and [[electric bass]], as with the guitar, ghost notes can be performed by muting the strings, either with the fretting hand or the plucking/picking hand, which creates notes of indeterminate pitch that have a percussive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUWVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=ghost+note+guitar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-sqeUq3dAvbLsQSp4IK4Bw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ghost%20note%20guitar&amp;f=false | title=Beginner Bass Guitar Lessons - Progressive: Teach Yourself How to Play Bass Guitar (Google eBook) | publisher=LearnToPlayMusic.com | author=Turner, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the electric bass, ghost notes are widely used in the [[slap bass]] style, as a way of creating a percussive, drum-like sound in [[funk]] and Latin music. On the double bass, percussive ghost notes are sometimes performed by slapping the strings against the fingerboard, which creates a percussive, "clacky" sound. With the double bass, slap-style ghost notes are used in [[rockabilly]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and traditional blues and [[swing jazz]].

Bassists [[James Jamerson]] (of [[Motown]]), [[Carol Kaye]] (of Motown), [[Rocco Prestia]] (for Tower of Power), and [[Chuck Rainey]] (for [[Steely Dan]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and others) all include "tons of ghost notes done right" in their playing.&lt;ref name="Stuff"/&gt;

== Vocal music ==
In vocal music, especially in [[musical theater]], a ghost note represents that the lyrics must be spoken rather than sung, retaining the marked rhythm but having indeterminate pitch.  Notes with value less than a half note use an "X" instead of an oval as a note head.  Occasionally a half note or whole note is represented with an open diamond note head, often representing a scream or grunt.

As an extreme example, ghost notes are almost exclusively used in "Rock Island", the opening number of ''[[The Music Man]]''.

This notation may also indicate [[Sprechgesang|Sprechstimme]] or [[rapping]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37431">The '''Global 200''' is the list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|
WWF]], the global conservation organization, as priorities for conservation. According to WWF, an ecoregion is defined as a "relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics, and environmental conditions".&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein. 1998. The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth’s most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515.[http://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Biodiversity/pdf/OlsonDinerstein1998.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, D. M., Dinerstein, E. 2002. The Global 200: Priority ecoregions for global conservation. ''Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden'' 89(2):199-224, [http://coastalforests.tfcg.org/pubs/Global%20200%20ecoregion.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nature Conservancy. 1997. ''Designing a geography of hope: guidelines for ecoregion-based conservation in The Nature Conservancy''. The Nature Conservancy, Arlington, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, based on their levels of [[endemism]], Madagascar gets multiple listings, ancient Lake Baikal gets one, and the North American Great Lakes get none. 

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200: '''critical or endangered'''; '''vulnerable'''; and '''relatively stable or intact'''. Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Background==
The WWF has identified 867 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s across the Earth's land surface, as well as [[freshwater ecoregion|freshwater]] and [[marine ecoregion]]s. The goal of this classification system is to ensure that the full range of [[ecosystem]]s will be represented in regional conservation and development strategies. Of these ecoregions, the WWF selected the Global 200 as the ecoregions most crucial to the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] of global [[biodiversity]]. The Global 200 list actually contains 238 ecoregions, made up of 142 terrestrial, 53 freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions.

[[conservation movement|Conservationist]]s interested in preserving biodiversity have generally focused on the preservation of [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]] (commonly known as tropical rainforests) because it is estimated that they harbor one half of Earth's species. On the other hand, the WWF determined that a more comprehensive strategy for conserving global biodiversity should also consider the other half of species, as well as the [[ecosystem]]s that support them.

Several habitats, such as [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], were determined to be more threatened than tropical rain forests, and therefore require concerted conservation action. WWF maintains that "although conservation action typically takes place at the country level, patterns of biodiversity and ecological processes (e.g., migration) do not conform to political boundaries", which is why ecoregion-based conservation strategies are deemed essential.

===Classification===
Historically, zoologists and botanists have developed various classification systems that take into account the world's plant and animal communities. Two of the worldwide classification systems most commonly used today were summarized by [[Miklos Udvardy]] in 1975.

The Earth's land surface can be divided into eight [[biogeographical realms]] (formerly called kingdoms, and which the BBC calls [[ecozone]]s) that represent the major terrestrial communities of animals and plants, and are a synthesis of previous systems of [[floristic province]]s and faunal regions. The biome system classifies the world into ecosystem types (i.e. forests, grasslands, etc.) based on climate and vegetation. Each biogeographical realm contains multiple biomes, and biomes occur across several biogeographical realms. A system of [[biogeographical provinces]] was developed to identify specific geographic areas in each biogeographical realm that were of a consistent biome type, and shared distinct plant and animal communities. The WWF system represents a further refinement of the system of biomes (which the WWF calls "major habitat types"), biogeographical realms, and biogeographical provinces (the WWF scheme divides most biogeographical provinces into multiple smaller ecoregions).

===Selection process===
Based on a comprehensive list of [[ecoregion]]s, The Global 200 includes all major habitat types (biomes), all [[ecosystem]] types, and [[species]] from every major habitat type. It focuses on each major habitat type of every continent (such as [[tropical forest]]s or [[coral reef]]s). It uses [[ecoregion]]s as the unit of scale for comparison. WWF say ecoregions could be considered as conservation units at regional scale because they meet similar biological communities.

Some ecoregions were selected over other ecoregions of the same major habitat type (biome) or ecozone. Selection of the Global 200 relied on extensive studies of 19 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine major habitat types. Selection of the ecoregions was based on analyses of species richness, species [[endemic (ecology)|endemism]], unique higher [[taxon|taxa]], unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity of major habitat type.

Global 200 ecoregion list is most helpful to conservation efforts at a regional scale: local [[deforestation]], destruction of swamp habitats, degradation of soils, etc. However, certain phenomena, such as bird or whale [[Fish migration|migration]], depend on more complex parameters not used to define the current [[database]], such as atmospheric currents and dynamic [[pelagic]] ecosystems. These would require gathering more information, and co-ordination of efforts between multiple ecoregions. However, the Global 200 ecoregions can help these efforts by identifying habitat sites and resting sites for migratory animals. It may also help identify the origin of [[invasive species]], and offer insights for slowing down or stopping their intrusion.

There is a row of triangular [[amulet]] [[kilim motifs|motifs]] (Muska) at top and bottom; each of the four lower guls has a star motif (Yıldız) at its centre.]]
[[File:Oriental rugs, antique and modern (1922) (14780627715).jpg|thumb|[[Turkmens|Turkmen]] carpet with 3 central gul medallions]]

A '''gul''' (also written gol, göl and gül) is a medallion-like design element typical of traditional hand-[[Weaving|woven]] carpets from [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]]. In Turkmen weavings they are often repeated to form the pattern in the main field.

==Shape==

Guls are medallions, often [[octagon]]al, and often somewhat angular on a generally octagonal plan, though they can be somewhat rounded within the constraints of carpet-weaving, and some are lozenge-shaped ([[rhombus]]es). They usually have either [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|twofold rotational symmetry]] or mirror [[reflection symmetry]] (often both left/right and up/down).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Gallery. Carpet Turkey (Kurdish) 18th century |url=http://mathforum.org/geometry/rugs/gallery/08.html |publisher=MathForum |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guls were historically described in the West as being elephant's foot motifs. Other Western guesses held that the gul was a drawing of a round Turkmen tent, with lines between tents representing irrigation canals; or that the emblem was a [[totem]]ic bird. None of these descriptions have any basis in weaving tradition or culture.&lt;ref name=ThompsonElephant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term gul, gol, göl or gül is used widely across Central and West Asia, and among carpet specialists in the West. It may derive from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word gol, which means flower or rose,&lt;ref name=LittlePersia&gt;{{cite web |title=Rug Layouts and Designs|url=http://www.little-persia.com/?action=RugDesign#gul |publisher=Little Persia |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the Turkish word gül which similarly means a rose or roundel.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] weavings, such as bags and rugs, guls are often repeated to form the basic pattern in the main field (excluding the border).&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan&gt;{{cite web|title=Carpet Motifs: A Beginner’s Guide|url=http://arastan.com/journey/carpet-motifs-beginners-guide|publisher=Arastan|accessdate=28 January 2016|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This use of guls is occasionally found also in Turkish carpets, though they more often have one or a few guls arranged centrally in the main field.--&gt;

The different Turkmen tribes such as [[Teke tribe|Tekke]], [[Salor]], [[Ersari]] and [[Yomut]] traditionally wove a variety of guls, some of ancient design, but gul designs were often used by more than one tribe, and by non-Turkmens.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arastan/&gt;

Western authors have used comparison of the "design vocabulary" of tribal guls, reproduced on traditional rugs, in studying the [[ethnogenesis]] of Asian peoples.&lt;ref name=Mace&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mace, Ruth |author2=Holden, Clare J. |author3=Shennan, Stephen |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YP_p5eS898C |title=The evolution of cultural diversity: a phylogenetic approach |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-84472-099-3 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Western culture==
[[File:Hans Memling 065.jpg|thumb|Triptych by [[Hans Memling]], 1479, with a gul-patterned carpet at the Virgin's feet]]
{{further|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}

Western artists including [[Hans Memling]] depicted [[oriental carpet]]s from Turkish Anatolia with guls in several of his paintings, to the extent that these are known as [[Memling carpet]]s. These guls often contain star or (hooked) dragon [[Kilim motifs|motifs]] as found on 15th century [[Konya]] carpets.&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;{{cite web |last1=Howe |first1=R. John |title=The "Memling" Gul Motif, The Lecture |url=https://rjohnhowe.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/the-memling-gul-motif-the-lecture/ |publisher=R. John Howe &lt;!--carpet expert--&gt; |accessdate=28 January 2016 |date=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the hooked motif defines a "Memling carpet".&lt;ref&gt;King, Donald and [[David Sylvester|Sylvester, David]] eds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4249">[[File:Vileishis Palace1.jpg|thumb|[[Vileišis Palace]] houses the institute at present]]The '''Institute of the Lithuanian Language''' in [[Vilnius]] is a state-supported research organization that focuses on research into the [[Lithuanian language]].

== History ==

The origins of the institute can be traced to the editorial commission [[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian]], founded by Professor [[Juozas Balčikonis]] in 1930. As an outgrowth of this commission, the Antanas Smetona Institute for Lithuanian Studies was founded in 1939. This institute's goal was to research the Lithuanian language. 

After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of Lithuania in 1941, the Antanas Smetona Institute for Lithuanian Studies and the Lithuanian Society of Science were merged into the Institute of the Lithuanian Language, within the greater framework of the Academy of Sciences. The Institute experienced difficulties during this period; a number of prominent linguists had emigrated, there was ideological pressure to employ [[Marxist]] language theory, and contacts with the international scholarly community were curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_2_05.htm The Lithuanian Language — Hostage Of Foreign Powers : 1940-1991&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 it was merged with the Institute of Lithuanian Literature. In April 1990 the Institute regained its status as an independent institution.

==Structure and activities ==

The Institute consists of four departments (Language History and Dialectology, Onomastics, Grammar, and Language Culture), two centers (Terminology and Lexicography), and a publishing house. Institute is active in academic fields of [[linguistics]], [[lexicology]], [[lexicography]], [[grammar]], and [[onomastics]]. As of January 2007, the staff of the Institute numbered 92, including 5 Doctors of Letters, 35 Doctors of Philosophy, and 11 doctoral students, directed by Jolanta Zabarskaitė.

Ongoing projects include:

*Compilation of a 20-volume dictionary of the Lithuanian language, including a computerised version
*The compilation of an academic grammar of the Lithuanian language
*Research into the evolution of Lithuanian syntax
*Research into Lithuanian dialects, as part of an atlas of European languages
*Study of the evolution and development of the written Lithuanian language, and creating a database of old Lithuanian writings
*Analysis of the development of the norms and terminology of the Lithuanian language in current usage, and the compilation of a database of linguistic phenomena and their assessment
*The preparation of an etymological dictionary of Lithuanian [[toponyms]] 
*Study of the origins of place names, personal names, and animal names in Lithuania
*Partnership in the EuroTermBank project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurotermbank.com The EuroTermBank Project&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on harmonisation and consolidation of terminology in new [[European Union]] member states

In October 2006, the Institute hosted an international conference entitled ''Terminology of National Languages and Globalization'', sponsored by the European Association for Terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eaft-aet.net/2905?set_lang_id=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501130718/http://www.eaft-aet.net/2905?set_lang_id=2 |archivedate=2007-05-01 |df= }} European Association for Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs (INSC)''', was founded by [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel laureate]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]] Dr. [[Abdus Salam]] (then-Science Advisor to the Prime minister) to promote physics and scientific research activities in Pakistan. Having suggested by Professor Abdus Salam to the Government of Pakistan, it was established by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's chairman Mr. [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]. 

An annual college based summer camp, it is organised by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and National Center For Physics while it is sponsored by International Center for Theoretical Physics and the Minister of Science and Technology of Pakistan. A Physics research centre, it is located in Nathiagali city of Pakistan, and its current director is dr. Riazuddin, a pupil student of professor Salam.

==Objectives==
*Breaking the intellectual isolation of the scientist in the developing countries.
*Keeping pace with the rapid progress in science and contemporary needs by promoting higher science education.
*Placing due emphasis on the interaction of modern trends in physics and their applications in current technological development with special reference to the needs of the countries of the third world.
*Promoting a scientific dialogue and provide opportunity and opening avenues for co-operation and joint research programs.
*Broaden the outlook of the participants, to re-orient their scientific activities
*Indicate the areas where research could be carried out with limited facilities of developing countries.

==History==
Professor Abdus Salam had played a major and an integral role in Pakistan's science policy. Professor Salam had supervised more than 21 PhD during his teaching career at the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], United Kingdom. Half of these students were Pakistanis in which the majority of students had returned to Pakistan to join Abdus Salam. 

To promote scientific activities in the country, professor Abdus Salam had done the ground breaking work in establishing the research facilities throughout the country. In 1976, Abdus Salam had suggested to Prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] to established the annual college to promote the scientific activities in the country. [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], then-chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC), took the task as he had strongly advocated for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Research and program emphasis==
[[File:Nathya Gali, Pakistan 3 by gul791.jpg|right|200pc|thumb|The INSC is located in Nathiagali, Pakistan.]]
The institution is noted for its high-powered research in [[particle physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[theoretical physics]], [[astrophysics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Semiconductor physics]], [[superconductor]], [[general relativity]], [[polymer physics]], [[experimental physics]], [[molecular physics]], [[atomic physics]], [[laser physics]], [[cosmology]] and research on nuclear and particle detectors. The institution also host lectures in different fields of science and mathematics

The scientific organisations, such as [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]], [[National Centre for Physics|NCP]], [[Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|PCSIR]] and [[Pakistan Engineering Council|PEC]], had delegated and invited hundreds of scientists from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Americas to participate in the annual event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;

Malinchism is also associated with a societal depiction of women as the source of betrayal and nefarious behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Julia Maria|title=Recreating the Image of Women in Mexico:  A Genealogy of Resistance in Mexican Narrative Set During the Revolution|date=2010|volume=Graduate Faculty - Thesis|page=6|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717070125/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the images of Mexican popular culture, this theme plays out with [[La Malinche|Malinche]] often portrayed as both the deceiver and the deceived. In theatrical productions, she is sometimes portrayed as a victim of conquest, and sometimes the manufacturer of her own destiny; almost always, Malinche is portrayed as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]], in a form of [[victim blaming]].

'''The Mathematical Institute''' is the [[mathematics]] department at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It forms one of the twelve departments of the [[Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division]] in the University. The department is located between [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] and [[Green Templeton College, Oxford|Green Templeton College]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], next to the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

==Overview==
The Oxford Mathematical Institute includes both pure and applied mathematics (Statistics is a separate department) and is one of the largest and most respected mathematics departments in the UK with about 100 faculty members, and was ranked as the top mathematics department in the UK in the 2014 UK Research Evaluation Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/Attachments/2014/12/17/g/o/l/sub-14-01.pdf Research Excellence Framework 2014 ranking]&lt;/ref&gt; Research at the Mathematical Institute covers all branches of mathematical sciences ranging from, for example, algebra, number theory, and geometry to the application of mathematics to a wide range of fields including industry, finance, climate modelling, networks and the brain. It has over 850 undergraduates, over 250 postgraduates and around 150 MSc students. 

==History==
[[File:Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.jpg|thumb|Former Mathematical Institute building, built in 1966.]]
The first Mathematical Institute was built in 1966 and was located at the northern end of [[St Giles' Street, Oxford|St Giles']] near the junction with [[Banbury Road]] in central north [[Oxford]]. The building of an institute was originally proposed by [[G.H. Hardy]] at least 30 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/OxfordPeople.html The British Society for the History of Mathematics Gazetteer], [[University of Warwick]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Institute had two annexes: one in Dartington House, on [[Little Clarendon Street]], and the other in the Gibson Building, on the site of the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about-us About], Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of [[Michaelmas term]] 2013 Oxford Mathematics has been unified and is now housed in the purpose-built [[Andrew Wiles]] Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in [[North Oxford]], near the original Radcliffe Infirmary. Wiles, the Regius Professor of Mathematics at the university, is known for proving [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].&lt;ref name="Short History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.maths.ox.ac.uk/system/files/attachments/OxfordMathematics_ROQ_leaflet.pdf|title=The Andrew Wiles Builkding - a Short History|publisher=maths.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Mind Map on ICT and Pedagogy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A mind map about educational technology]]
{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.&lt;ref name="escher02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">The '''moral high ground''', in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness.
:"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/moralhg.htm Moral High Ground] - International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict - Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Holding the moral high ground can be used to legitimize [[political movements]], notably [[nonviolent resistance]], especially in the face of violent opposition,&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Johnson, ''Gandhi's Experiment with Truth'' (2006) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by [[civil disobedience]] movements around the world to garner sympathy and support from society.

Similarly, 21st century states may refrain from declaring war in order to retain the moral high ground – though the cynic will observe that [[realpolitik]] still leads to wars being ''fought'', only without declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dinstein, ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'' (2005) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Economist and social critic [[Robert H. Frank]] challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7602.html What Price the Moral High Ground: Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments] - Robert H. Frank, {{ISBN|0-691-00672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teniati, ''The Collaborative Enterprise'' (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday use==

In everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a [[critique]] of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to [[snobbery]] but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.

Social sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from [[popular culture]], perhaps by using [[critical pedagogy]]: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''Tolkien'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Kate Fillion considered that in the wake of [[second-wave feminism]] "assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse", placing women as "comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (1997) p. 305 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert Lowell]] took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, '' Finders Keepers'' (2002) p. 205-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]] considered that [[Tony Blair]] was "good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Jenkins, ''Thatcher and Sons'' (2007) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)''' denotes the level of exposure of an [[organism]], found by [[experiment]] or [[observation]], at which there is no biologically or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]] increase in the frequency or severity of any adverse effects (e.g. alteration of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], functional capacity, [[Human development (biology)|growth]], development or life span) in the exposed population when compared to its appropriate control. In non-clinical assessment, NOAEL plays a pivotal role. It is determined or proposed by qualified personnel (pharmacologist or toxicologist) depending on the study, drug indications and its pharmacological therapeutics side/adverse effects. NOAEL could be defined as "the highest experimental point that is without adverse effect," meaning that under laboratory conditions, it is the level where there is no side-effects. It either does not provide the effects of drug with respect to duration and dose, or it does not address the interpretation of risk based on toxicologically relevant effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelhardt JA|first1=Dorato MA|title=The no-observed-adverse-effect-level in drug safety evaluations: Use, issues, and definition(s)|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|date=August 2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=265–274|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.05.004|pmid=15979222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To say detail the NOAEL does not describe the duration, dose, or risk involved and is therefore more of a threshold marker. This is also known as highest no-effect level, or HNEL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Marie |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Piggott | editor2-first=J.R. |date=July 2013| edition=1991 |title=Handbook of Sweeteners |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781475753820 |access-date=February 5, 2018 |location=New York, New York, USA |publisher=Springer |page=279 |isbn= 978-1475753820 |archive-date=February 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UP2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=HNEL+highest+level&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=25JLOIE2H6&amp;sig=rUuML3qwEC_yMWOR1dodNxMCJ8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUxZbRno_ZAhWHSBQKHW0jCo0Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=HNEL%20highest%20level&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">'''Open management education''' refers to business and management programs and courses making use of [[open educational resources]] and [[open content]]. The main idea is to develop competences by re-use, combination and adaption of freely accessible, existing resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kalz, M., Specht, M., Nadolski, R., Bastiaens, Y., Leirs, N., and Pawlowski, J.M. (2010) OpenScout: Competence based management education with community-improved open educational resources, 17th EDINEBConference: Crossing borders in Education and Work-based Learning, London, UK, June 2010, [http://hdl.handle.net/1820/2452]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and purpose ==
Programs and trainings in business and management are often not affordable, especially for SMEs or for people in less developed countries. Therefore, open management education seems like a promising alternative for many stakeholders.

== Challenges ==
It is still an ongoing discussion which [[business models]] could be applied, such as sharing or add-on models. However, the domain is still developing and no business model has become mainstream. A good discussion can be found by Downes (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S. (2007): Models for Sustainable Open Educational Resources in Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects 3 29-44 February 27, 2007. [http://www.downes.ca/post/33401]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge is to find simple tools to adapt (the sometimes complex) resources.&lt;ref&gt;Mikroyannidis, Alexander; Okada, Alexandra and Connolly, Teresa (2011). Sharing practices and experiences on the authoring and adaptation of Open Educational Resources. In: Open Educational Resources 2011, 11–13 May 2011, Manchester, UK. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29265/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to open management education ==
There are many repositories, databases and web access points, some of them listed here:
* [http://learn.openscout.net OpenScout] providing access to global resources in the business and management sector.  It is possible to search for competences to be achieved and to get help with tools for adaptation (e.g. internationalizing materials, adapting the design, contextualizing), see also the Wikipedia entry for [[Openscout]]
* [http://www.khanacademy.org The Khan Academy] provides a variety of business courses.
* [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] access to courses from MIT, some of them related to management
* MERLOT [http://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?category=2202 Repository] (Category Business) 
* Globe Info (Federation of Repositories): (no browsing, just use keywords such as management or better more specific) [http://www.globe-info.org/ Search page]

[[File:Dan2parallel.jpg|thumb|A paraphrase of the [[Book of Daniel]] placing in parallel prophecy and interprephrases]]

A '''paraphrase''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|f|r|eɪ|z}} is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The term itself is derived via [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|paraphrasis}}'' from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, meaning "additional manner of expression".  The act of paraphrasing is also called "paraphrasis".

A paraphrase typically explains or clarifies the text that is being paraphrased. For example, "The signal was red" might be paraphrased as "The train was not allowed to pass because the signal was red". A paraphrase is usually introduced with ''[[verbum dicendi]]''—a declaratory expression to signal the transition to the paraphrase. For example, in "The signal was red, ''that is'', the train was not allowed to proceed," the ''that is'' signals the paraphrase that follows.

A paraphrase does not need to accompany a direct [[quotation]], the paraphrase typically serves to put the source's statement into perspective or to clarify the context in which it appeared. A paraphrase is typically more detailed than a [[:wikt:summary|summary]]. One should add the source at the end of the sentence, for example: When the light was red, trains could not go (Wikipedia).

Paraphrase may attempt to preserve the essential [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the material being paraphrased. Thus, the (intentional or otherwise) reinterpretation of a source to infer a meaning that is not explicitly evident in the source itself qualifies as "original [[research]]," and not as  paraphrase.

Unlike a [[metaphrase|''meta''phrase]], which represents a "formal equivalent" of the source, a ''para''phrase represents a "dynamic equivalent" thereof. While a metaphrase attempts to translate a text literally, a paraphrase conveys the essential thought expressed in a source text&amp;#8203;, &amp;#8203;if necessary, at the expense of [[literal and figurative language|literality]]. For details, see [[dynamic and formal equivalence]].

The term is applied to the genre of [[Biblical paraphrase]]s, which were the most widely circulated versions of the Bible available in medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="jh"&gt;{{cite journal|first=James H. |last=Morey |title=Peter Comestar, Biblical Paraphrase, and the Medieval Popular Bible |journal=Speculum |volume=68 |number=1 |date=January 1993 |pages=6–35 |doi=10.2307/2863832}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the purpose was not to render an exact rendition of the meaning or the complete text, but to present material from the Bible in a version that was theologically orthodox and not subject to heretical interpretation, or, in most cases, to take from the Bible and present to a wide public material that was interesting, entertaining and spiritually meaningful, or, simply to abridge the text.&lt;ref name="jh"/&gt;

The phrase "in your own words" is often used within this context to imply that the writer has rewritten the text in their own writing style - how they would have written it if they had created the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/skillsforstudy/writing-in-your-own-words.php | title=Writing in your own words | publisher=The Open University | accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, there are some models to learn and recognize paraphrase on natural language texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Figueroa|first=Alejandro |author2=Guenter Neumann  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259174469_Learning_to_Rank_Effective_Paraphrases_from_Query_Logs_for_Community_Question_Answering  |title=Learning to Rank Effective Paraphrases from Query Logs for Community Question Answering |conference= AAAI |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentences can also be automatically paraphrased using [[text simplification]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Shardlow, Matthew. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f50/efc8e572397e58a7b3a2021da737225fecc5.pdf A survey of automated text simplification]."

The '''Pennington Biomedical Research Center''', located in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], is a campus of the [[Louisiana State University System]] and conducts clinical, basic, and population science research. The mission is to discover the triggers of chronic diseases through innovative research that improves human health across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; It is the largest academically based nutrition research center in the world, with the greatest number of obesity researchers on faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Reasons to Work at Pennington Biomedical|url=http://www.pbrc.edu/human-resources/reasons/|website=Pennington Biomedical Research Center|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center's over 500 employees occupy several buildings on the {{convert|222|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; The center was designed by the Baton Rouge [[architect]] [[John Desmond]].

== History ==
In 1980, [[Baton Rouge]] oilman and philanthropist C. B. "Doc" Pennington and his wife, Irene, provided $125 million to fund construction of the nutritional research center. With a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] contract and funding from the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority, [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Buddy Roemer]] proclaimed the official opening of the Center in 1988. Dr [[George A. Bray]], a renowned obesity researcher, was recruited to be the first executive director of the center and under his leadership the center reached its present status in the scientific world.

Today, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center houses almost 600 employees, 14 research laboratories, 17 core service laboratories, an inpatient and outpatient clinic, two metabolic chambers, a research kitchen, an administrative area, more than $20 million in technologically advanced equipment, and a team of over 80 scientists and physicians with specialties such as molecular biology, genomics and proteomics, neuroanatomy, exercise physiology, biochemistry, psychology, endocrinology, biostatistics and electrophysiology.

One of the former employees was the late state legislator [[Leonard J. Chabert]] from [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]], the namesake of the Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelius.com/results.php?ReportType=1&amp;formname=name&amp;qf=Leonard&amp;qmi=J&amp;qn=Chabert&amp;qcs=Houma%2C+LA&amp;focusfirst=1|title=Leonard J. Chabert|publisher=intelius.com|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research programs and labs ==
The comprehensive research program at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center focuses on ten specific research program areas as outlined below. Researchers in these divisions rely on the latest molecular, physiological, clinical, behavioral, and bioinformatics technologies with the ultimate goal of preventing common diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.&lt;ref name=programs&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programs|url=http://www.pbrc.edu/research-and-faculty/research-programs/|website=Pennington Biomedical Research Center|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10678">The '''Portlethen Moss''' {{coord|57|3|27.04|N|2|8|50.68|W|region:GB|display=title}} is an [[acid]]ic bog [[nature reserve]] located to the west of the town of [[Portlethen]], [[Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]].  Like other [[Bog|mosses]], this [[wetland]] area supports a variety of plant and animal [[species]], even though it has been subject to certain development and [[agricultural]] degradation pressures.  For example, the [[Great Crested Newt]] was found here prior to the expansion of the town of [[Portlethen]].  Many acid loving vegetative species occur in Portlethen Moss, and the [[habitat]] is monitored by the [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]].

Portlethen Moss is the location of considerable [[prehistoric]], [[Middle Ages]] and seventeenth century history, largely due to a ridge near the bog which was the route of early travellers.  By at least the [[Middle Ages]] this [[trackway]] was more formally constructed with raised stonework and called the [[Causey Mounth]].  Without this [[drovers' road]], travel through the Portlethen Moss and several nearby bogs would have been impossible between [[Aberdeen]] and coastal points to the south.

==History==
[[Image:Calluna vulgaris 1.jpg|thumb|left|True [[Calluna|heather]], a common plant on the Portlethen Moss]]

Prehistoric man inhabited the Portlethen Moss area as evidenced by well preserved [[Iron Age]] [[stone circle]]s and other excavated [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, A 1998 'Charcoal samples', in Rees, T 'Excavation of Cairnwell Ring-Cairn, Portlethen', Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 127, 255-280&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously only the outcrops and ridge areas would have been habitable, but the desirability of primitive habitation would have been enhanced by  proximity to the sea and natural defensive protection of the moss to impede intruders. From [[Tacitus]] accounts&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Accounts of Agricola in Caledonia'', ca 42AD&lt;/ref&gt; of the Roman general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]], it is known that the Romans were daunted by Portlethen Moss, [[Netherley Red Moss]], [[Cookney Moss]] and other local bogs that hindered travel. This is also evidenced by the [[Roman Camp]] of [[Raedykes]] having been established immediately south of this cluster of [[moss (habitat)|mosses]]; the Romans not being able to progress further north, turned inland toward [[Netherley, Aberdeenshire|Netherley]].The Portlethen Moss is near the Grampian Mountains.

The ancient [[Causey Mounth]] passage specifically connected the [[Bridge of Dee]] to the town of [[Stonehaven]]. This route was used to access the historic meeting of the [[Covenanter]]s at [[Muchalls Castle]] in the year 1638 AD as they opposed the Bishops of Aberdeen. The route was also that taken by the [[William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal]] and [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] when they led a [[Covenanter]] army of 9000 men in the biggest battle of the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Watt, ''Highways and Biways around [[Kincardineshire]]'', Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the east of Portlethen Moss lie three original [[coast]]al [[fishing]] villages: [[Findon, Scotland|Findon]], [[Portlethen]] Village and [[Downies]]. In the period 1960 to 2005, Portlethen has developed as a [[dormitory town]] to Aberdeen and a location for [[retail]] [[Big-box store#United Kingdom|superstore]]s.

==Conservation status==
The Portlethen Moss is a recognised nature preserve by the Scottish Wildlife Trust (with designation PLM076) and the Aberdeenshire Council.  While [[peat]] cutting was conducted in prehistoric and [[Middle Ages]] times, there has been no harvesting of peat in the modern era.  There is some ongoing loss of moss habitat from [[cattle]] [[grazing]], but the most significant threat is from ongoing land development pressure;&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Everingham, ''Portlethen Moss Survey'', Scottish Wildlife Trust, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, half of the Portlethen Moss has been lost to [[Urban development|urban]] (low density) land development by the town of Portlethen during the period 1985 to 2005.  Trampling is considered an insignificant threat due to the small animal or human presence in the existing nature reserve area; furthermore, cattle grazing, while ongoing, is deemed a much lesser current threat than [[Human overpopulation|population expansion pressure]].  Enrichment (addition of grazing animal  [[manure]]) is not a major issue due to the low density of animals.  As a net result damage to the primordial moss is considered extensive and widespread by the Scottish Wildlife Trust.  The raised bog habitat of the Portlethen Moss is also protected by the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]].

==Topography and meteorology==
[[Image:Ruinedchapel.jpg|thumb|left|Ruined Episcopal chapel from 18th century south of the Portlethen Moss along the Causey Mounth]]
Portlethen Moss is considered a [[raised bog]], because its general situation is on higher ground, at the edge of the [[Mounth]], a coastal mountain spur of the [[Grampian Mountains]] overlooking the [[North Sea]].  There are rock [[outcrop]]s and strewn [[boulder]]s [[relict]] from the glacial age at this site.  Elevations within the Portlethen Moss range from approximately 35 to 60 metres above sea level.  Formation of this moss has occurred due to extensive sets of depressions in the underlying rock formations of [[Old Red Sandstone]].  The entire water composition of the bog thus has been provided by [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] with no source of [[surface runoff]], since the topography reduces to lower elevations in every direction.  Due to the high winds, moderate precipitation and cool temperatures that generally prevail, conditions are favourable for formation of an acid bog, since water stagnates, but eventually evaporates with ensuing acidity enhancement of decaying organic matter.  There was virtually no [[drainage]] outlet in prehistoric times, and little drainage even in modern times.

==Evolution of Portlethen Moss==
Many coastal mosses were initiated by the process of [[glacier|glaciation]], which sheared rock formations to a generally level terrain, while also gouging moderate sized craters that would pond.  This description fits the fundamental situation of Portlethen Moss, where sphagnum would have flourished over millennia of [[evaporation]], further intensifying the [[soil acidity]], fueled by organic matter decaying, with little drainage outlet.  A layer of [[sphagnum]] moss would have developed at the [[benthic]] level of the bog, and additional sphagnum layers floated in mats atop the bog.

At an intermediate level of evolution, thick peat layers formed from decay and carbonisation of the rotting sphagnum.  Generations of carex and juncus flourished, leading to further decay of these materials and eventual heightening of the organic mass.  Finally, secondary vegetation took root in the spongy sphagnum mats adding greater biomass to the bog.In some cases the heavy saturated organic layers could actually rupture, spilling large volumes of mud and organic debris to surrounding fields, thus enabling a bed for further spatial expansion of the entire bog.    Ultimately the colour of the moss waters became blood red in colour, from the successive organic decay and stagnation.  Only in times associated with cattle grazing and significant human presence (probably the late Iron Age), would this process reverse and the bog reduce in size.

==Vegetation==
A wide variety of [[sphagnum]], [[carex|sedges]], [[juncus|rushes]] and other characteristic bog species inhabit Portlethen Moss.  Sometimes insectivorous plants reside in mosses, since the soils are generally nutrient poor.  The heath also serves as a food source for area [[roe deer]], while ''Corydalis'' is an attractive host for numerous [[butterfly]] [[larva]]e.  Representative plant species found in this nature reserve include:

==Relation to other mosses==
There are numerous mosses or bog habitats in Scotland, many of them situated also in Aberdeenshire, including the [[Cookney Moss]], [[Leuchar Moss]] and [[Red Moss of Netherley]] nearby.  There are also many other shires within Scotland that contain mosses such as [[Fife]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Morayshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]].  Some of these are lowland bogs and others, like Portlethen Moss, are raised bogs.  There are other similar acidic peat bogs in the northern part of [[North America]], [[Russia]] and northern [[Europe]], but in those locations they are usually called "bogs".

[[Penguin]]s use stones for building their [[Bird nest|nests]]. Based on a 1998 study, media reports stated&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; that a shortage of stones led female Adélie penguins&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Maggie (2005-01-02) [http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Birds/Archives/2005/Mating-in-a-Material.aspx Mating in a Material World], [[National Wildlife Federation]]&lt;/ref&gt; to trade sex for stones. Some pair-bonded female penguins copulate with males who are not their mates and then take pebbles for their own nests.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Chimpanzees who appear to be trading food for sex have also been described as engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;

==Penguins==
{{see also|Adélie penguin}}
[[File:Manchot Adelie - Adelie Penguin.jpg|thumb|Adélie penguin]]
Prostitution in animals was first reported in 1998 by Fiona Hunter, a researcher at the [[University of Cambridge]], and Lloyd Davis of the [[University of Otago]], who had spent five years observing the mating behavior of Adélie penguins. The study was conducted as part of an [[Antarctica New Zealand]] programme on the [[Ross Island]], approximately {{convert|800|mi}} from the [[South Pole]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

According to the report about the study published by [[BBC News Online]], some female penguins sneak around on their partners.  These prostitutes have sex with unattached males and take a pebble from the male's nest after having sex. In an actual study the researchers speculate that the female has bent over to grab a stone and the male has misinterpreted the gesture—she hasn't changed her mind or performed a trick. But researchers are still studying the phenomenon, and a consensus has not yet been reached; it is assumed that either the female is baiting, or that the male deliberately chooses to misinterpret the gesture, as coercive sexual copulation is common among these penguins. The BBC further reported Hunter as saying that the female penguins probably didn't engage in prostitution only for stones. Hunter believed "what they are doing is having copulation for another reason and just taking the stones as well. We don't know exactly why, but they are using the males".  This behavior was also suggested as a [[mate choice]] process by which the females might find a possible future mate.  This would provide a female penguin with another male penguin should their current mate die. The male penguins, the study speculates, were engaged in sex with the prostitute females only for sexual satisfaction. According to Hunter's observation, the number of prostitute penguins was very low, and she approximated this as "only a few percent".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

While the sensationalized versions of the study emphasize prostitution, the research data itself is less sensational. The data show that when extrapair copulation occurs at the male's nesting site, the female takes one or more stones; but when the extrapair copulation occurs at the female's nesting site, the male never takes a stone.  Clearly a male who has copulated with a female benefits his progeny when she takes a stone.  Sometimes copulation doesn't occur, but the female still takes a stone.  But both males and females steal stones: sometimes they get away with it and sometimes they are attacked.  The benefit of gaining stones without a fight is clear, but the female is not always willing to copulate to avoid a fight.  The researchers speculate about the possible genetic fitness advantages and disadvantages of the practice, and aren't altogether sure that the female copulates mainly in order to obtain a stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=E.M.|author2=Davis, S.L. |year=1998|title=Female Adélie Penguins Acquire Nest Material from Extrapair Males after Engaging in Extrapair Copulations |journal=The Auk|volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=526–528|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v115n02/p0526-p0528.pdf|doi=10.2307/4089218|jstor=4089218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chimpanzees==
[[File:Schimpanse zoo-leipig.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pan troglodytes]]'', similar to those observed in the [[Taï National Park]].]]
A study conducted by the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], and published online in the [[Public Library of Science]], attempted to support the meat-for-sex behaviour hypothesis, according to which, in early human societies the best male hunters had the maximum number of sexual partners. Unable to study early humans, researchers studied chimpanzees. Researchers observed chimpanzees in the [[Taï National Park]] and concluded that a form of prostitution exists among the chimpanzees in which females offer sex to males in exchange for meat. According to Cristina Gomes of the Institute, the study "strongly suggests that wild chimpanzees exchange meat for sex, and do so on a long-term basis".  The data reveal that chimps enter into communities of hunting and sharing meat with each other over long periods of time and females within the meat-sharing community tend to copulate with males of their own meat-sharing community.  Direct exchange of meat for sex has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cristina M. Gomes and Christophe Boesch |year=2009 |title=Wild Chimpanzees Exchange Meat for Sex on a Long-Term Basis |journal=PLOS ONE |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005116 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5116 |pmid=19352509 |pmc=2663035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capuchin monkeys==
[[File:Capuchin Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Capuchin monkey]]
A study at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]] trains [[capuchin monkey]]s to use silver discs as money in order to study their economic behavior. The discs could be exchanged by the monkeys for various treats. During one chaotic incident, a researcher observed what appeared to be a monkey exchanging a disc for sex. The monkey that was paid for sex immediately traded the silver disc for a grape. The researcher took steps to prevent any possibility of coins being traded for sex after his suspicions were aroused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html  Monkey Business], by [[Stephen J.

The '''Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory''' was founded in Nicolson Street, [[Edinburgh]] in 1906, by [[William Speirs Bruce]], who had travelled widely in the [[Antarctic]] and [[Arctic]] regions and had led the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] (SNAE) 1902&amp;ndash;04. Bruce had originally studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], but had transferred his studies to the [[natural sciences]] and, through his varied experiences, had established a reputation as a polar scientist. He had also collected a large number of [[botany|botanical]], [[biology|biological]], [[zoology|zoological]] and [[geology|geological]] specimens, together with vast amounts of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[magnetism|magnetic]] data.  The laboratory, established in [[Edinburgh]] at premises in Nicolson Street, provided a place to examine, store or display these materials, an office from which Bruce could work on the SNAE scientific reports, and a base from which further expeditions could be planned.&lt;ref name = Speak&gt;Speak, pp. 97&amp;ndash;101&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Bruce's ambition that the laboratory should develop into a Scottish National Oceanographical Institute. A meeting to discuss this possibility was held in May 1914, and the proposal gained significant support from leading Scottish scientists. An organising committee was established, but the matter was shelved on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and was not revived.&lt;ref name = Speak/&gt; In 1919 lack of funding, combined with his failing health, forced Bruce to close the laboratory, donating the various specimens, books and other materials to the University of Edinburgh, the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]] and the [[National Museums of Scotland|Royal Scottish Museum]].&lt;ref name = Speak/&gt; His illness ended with his death in 1921.

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men.

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social construction of technology''' (also referred to as '''SCOT''') is a theory within the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]]. Advocates of SCOT—that is, [[Social constructionism|social constructivists]]—argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to [[technological determinism]] and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.

SCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], and its subtopics include [[actor-network theory]]  (a branch of the [[sociology of science and technology]]) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see [[strong program]]). Leading adherents of SCOT include [[Wiebe Bijker]] and [[Trevor Pinch]].

SCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is "the best"—researchers must look at how the criteria of being "the best" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.

SCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.

==Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science==

At the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the [[strong programme]] in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the ''Principle of Symmetry'' as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.

===Symmetry===

The ''Principle of Symmetry'' holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same ''kind'' of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;Palacios, EM García, et al. "Introdução aos estudos CTS (Ciência, Tecnologia e Sociedade)." Cadernos de Ibero America (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their "objective truth", or inherent "technical superiority", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its "advanced technology" compared to the "primitiveness" of the [[Penny farthing|Penny Farthing]], but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing – in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven [[History of the bicycle|Safety Bicycle]]. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.

A weak reading of the ''Principle of Symmetry'' points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.

A strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.

== Core concepts ==

The following concepts and 'stages' of SCOT are adapted from the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR).&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E. Bijker.  "The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other."  ''Social Studies of Science'' 14 (August 1984): 399-441.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretative flexibility===
''Interpretative flexibility'' means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly [[aesthetics]] to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker2.pdf | title=The Social Constructions of Technological Systems | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | editor1=Wiebe E. Bijker | editor2= Thomas P. Hughes |editor3=Trevor Pinch |year=1987|isbn=0-262-02262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative interpretations generate different ''problems'' to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the "best" tradeoff between traction and speed?

====Relevant social groups====
The most basic relevant groups are the ''users'' and the ''producers'' of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated – users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. [[Trevor Pinch]] has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinch|first=Trevor|title=How Users Matter: The Co-Construction of Users and Technology|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-15107-3|pages=247–269|authorlink=Trevor Pinch|editor=Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.

====Design flexibility====
Just as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.

====Problems and conflicts====
The different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the "Anti-cyclists" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.

The first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.

===Closure&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Closure]] --&gt;===
Over time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:

#'''Rhetorical closure''': When social groups ''see'' the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.
#'''Redefinition of the problem''': A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the "speed problem", and this overrode previous concerns.

Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the "green" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)

The second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.

===Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu===
This is the third stage of the SCOT methodology, but the seminal article of Pinch and Bijker does not proceed to this stage. Many other historians and sociologists of technology nevertheless do. For example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book "The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America | publisher=The MIT Press | author=Paul N. Edwards | year=1997 | isbn=978-0262550284 | series=Inside Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.

==Criticism==
In 1993, [[Langdon Winner]] published an influential critique of SCOT entitled "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|title=Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=Summer 1993|volume=18|issue=3|pages=362–378|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:
# It explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.
# It examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.
# It is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.
# It actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.
Other critics include [[Stewart Russell]] with his letter in the journal "[[Social Studies of Science]]" titled "The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker".

'''Sociomusicology''' (from [[Latin]]: ''socius'', "companion"; from [[Old French]] ''musique''; and the suffix ''-ology'', "the study of", from Old Greek λόγος, ''lógos'' : "discourse"), also called '''music sociology''' or the '''sociology of music''', refers to both an academic [[Subfields of sociology|subfield]] of [[sociology]] that is concerned with [[music]] (often in combination with other arts), as well as a subfield of [[musicology]] that focuses on social aspects of musical behavior and the role of music in [[society]].

==Sociomusicological issues==
The work of scholars in sociomusicology is often similar to [[ethnomusicology]] in terms of its exploration of the sociocultural context of music; however, sociomusicology maintains less of an emphasis on ethnic and national identity, and is not limited to ethnographic methods. Rather, sociomusicologists use a wide range of [[research methods]] and take a strong interest in observable behavior and musical interactions within the constraints of [[social structure]]. Sociomusicologists are more likely than ethnomusicologists to make use of surveys and economic data, for example, and tend to focus on musical practices in contemporary industrialized societies. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology (cf. Ko, C. K. S. (2011). An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. This book {{ISBN|9789881580214}} has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174.)

Since the field of musicology has tended to emphasize [[historiographic]] and analytical/critical rather than sociological approaches to [[research]], sociomusicology is still regarded as somewhat outside the mainstream of musicology. Yet, with the increased popularity of [[ethnomusicology]] in recent decades (with which the field shares many similarities), as well as the development and mainstreaming of "[[New Musicology]]" (coinciding with the emergence of interdisciplinary [[Cultural Studies]] in academia), sociomusicology is increasingly coming into its own as a fully established field.The values and meanings associated with music are collectively constructed by both music listeners and performers. When listening to a piece, they reflect upon their own values and use the music to make connections between their own experiences and what the piece is perceived as communicating. The sociology of music looks specifically at these connections and the musical experiences tied to the person and the music itself.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine ELLIS, An Introduction to Music Studies, Chapter 3: ‘The Sociology of Music’. Pg. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most notable classical sociologists to examine the social aspects and effects of music were [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), [[Alfred Schutz]] (1899–1959), [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) and [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969). Others have included [[Alphons Silbermann]], [[Charles Seeger]] (1886–1979), [[Howard Saul Becker]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Jacques Attali]], John Mueller (1895–1965), and [[Christopher Small]]. Contemporary sociomusicologists include [[Tia DeNora]], Georgina Born, [[David G. Hebert|David Hebert]], Peter Martin, Timothy Dowd and Joseph Schloss.

'''''The Glasgow Looking Glass''''' was the first mass-produced publication to tell stories using illustrations, and as such is regarded as the earliest comics magazine.  The final issue was published on 3 April 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's first comic book from Glasgow in spotlight |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/world-s-first-comic-book-from-glasgow-in-spotlight-1-2974087 |first=Tristan |last=Stewart-Robertson |work=The Scotsman |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Aristotle and Tragicomedy."''

===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy. I don't think it would be appropriate to make it consistently a comedy, when there are kings and gods in it. What do you think?

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

In fall 2014, the University enrolled a total of 1,142 undergraduate students and 311 graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.usiouxfalls.edu/download/FastFacts |title=Download: USF Fast Facts|website=apps.usiouxfalls.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and early history===

On June 5, 1872, pastors and delegates of nine Baptist churches in the [[Dakota Territory]] gathered in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], at the first meeting of the Baptist Association.  They adopted the following resolution:  "Be it resolved that we take immediate steps for the establishment of an institution among us and that we devote a suitable portion of time at each annual meeting of the consideration of this important subject and give our individual associated influence to encourage a more general and complete education of our youth under distinctly Christian influence."

Under the name of Dakota Collegiate Institute, secondary and collegiate programs began on September 8, 1883. The institution's name changed to Sioux Falls University in 1885, with the secondary program called the Academy and the collegiate department branded Sioux Falls College. Although the college grew, the Academy's enrollment declined, forcing it to close in 1925.

Between 1929 and 1931, Sioux Falls College acquired four Baptist schools that had ceased to operate: Des Moines University, [[Des Moines, Iowa]]; [[List of colleges and universities in Nebraska#Defunct colleges|Grand Island College]], [[Grand Island, Nebraska]]; Cedar  Valley Seminary, [[Osage, Iowa]]; and Parker College, [[Winnebago, Minnesota]]. With the 1931 merger of Grand Island College with what was still legally Sioux Falls University, the institution's official name became Sioux Falls College.

During the Second World War, the college lost its accreditation and offered 200 students, mainly women, two-year degrees. Enrollment surged when the veterans returned home, only to lapse to meager numbers two years later. Financially, the school was in dire straits.

===Expansion===

Reuben P. Jeschke (1953–1970) helped regain full, regional accreditation in 1958, and under his leadership enrollment grew from 378 in 1958 to 1,006 in 1968 – a 166 percent increase. The institution's endowment, although modest, also grew, and what Jeschke described as a "near miracle" happened – a history of balanced budgets.

The most-visible change during this time was the campus. Jeschke oversaw the building of Mears Library, Salsbury Student Union, Salsbury Science Center, Jeschke Fine Arts Center and three residence halls. In fact, ''Time'' magazine featured the College's growth in 1967. The caption read: "Seven Buildings in Seven Years." The subtitle added: "But our stature comes from people." By the end of Jeschke's tenure, Sioux Falls College was well-positioned for the steady success of the 1970s and 1980s.

The 1980s saw the addition of a Degree Completion Program and graduate studies. Today, USF offers four graduate programs: Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Education Specialist (Ed.S.) and a joint doctoral degree in leadership with the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minn. USF also offers adult education programs: accelerated nursing and RN-to-BSN.

==="Naming the future"===

The 1990s ushered in a new era of excellence. In order to better reflect the Board of Trustees' desire to "name the future", one with growth in student body, expansion of academic programs, improvement in facilities and enhancement of the institution's reputation, Sioux Falls College became the University of Sioux Falls, effective January 1995.

Dr. Mark Benedetto became the 22nd president in 1997, and under his leadership the University has experienced several years of record enrollment and has added graduate programs in business and education. The number of full-time faculty has also more than doubled. In addition, 14 renovation and construction projects have been added to the 24-acre residential campus and the 82-acre USF Sports Complex at 69th Street and Cliff Avenue. New construction has included the following projects: Cleveland Professional Development Center, Collier Baker Hall, Bill and Marian Sullivan Faith and Living Center, Sports and Fitness Complex, McDonald Center and Salsbury Science Center addition and renovation.

In 2008, USF received a $2 million Title III grant from the Department of Education to start a nursing program. This grant provided funds for two simulation labs and renovation of existing science lab facilities. Today the nursing program offers a 15-month accelerated program, an RN-to-BSN program and a traditional undergraduate program.

In 2011, the University added the USF Sculpture Walk to its campus and publicly kicked off its fundraising campaign titled the Uncampaign that will run through 2020.

===Technology===

In 2012, USF built a new Media Studies Center, created a new Music Technology lab for Music majors and added an IdeaLab for Entrepreneurial Studies majors.&lt;ref name="usiouxfalls.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usiouxfalls.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43|title=Course Offerings|website=www.usiouxfalls.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
