'''''And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street''''' is [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]]'s first [[Children's literature|children's book]]. It was published under the pen name [[Dr. Seuss]]. First published by [[Vanguard Press]] in 1937, the story follows a boy named Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father at the end of his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.

Geisel conceived the core of the book aboard a ship in 1936, returning from a European vacation with his wife. The rhythm of the ship's engines captivated him and inspired the book's signature lines:

{{Poemquote|And that is a story that no one can beat
And to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street.}}

At least 20 publishers rejected the book before Geisel ran into an old college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|a street]] in Geisel's hometown of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book ''[[McElligot's Pool]]''.

==Plot==
The story begins as a boy named Marco walks home from school, thinking of his father's advice: "Marco, keep your eyelids up/ And see what you can see." However, the only thing Marco has seen on his walk is a horse pulling a wagon on Mulberry Street. To make his story more interesting, Marco imagines progressively more elaborate scenes based around the horse and wagon. He imagines the horse is first a zebra, then a reindeer, then an elephant, and finally an elephant helped by two giraffes. The wagon changes to a chariot, then a sled, then a cart holding a brass band.

Marco's realization that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street leads him to imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and [[Alderman|aldermen]]; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and a man with a ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street."

==Background==
Geisel was 33 and had ten years of experience in cartooning, illustrating and advertising when he began work on ''Mulberry Street''.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;Cohen (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;181–187&lt;/ref&gt; He had an established and prosperous career in advertising, including a contract with [[Standard Oil]] for [[FLIT|Flit]] bug spray. Geisel's popular campaign featured the line "Quick, Henry, the Flit!" &lt;ref name=corliss&gt;{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=That Old Feeling: Seuss on First|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,597240,00.html|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had also made some forays into book publishing: for [[Viking Press]] in 1931 he illustrated ''Boners'' and ''More Boners'', collections of quotations from children's school papers. The book's positive sales encouraged Geisel to create his own children's book,&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;Anderson (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;46&lt;/ref&gt; which his advertising contract did not forbid.&lt;ref name="weidt"&gt;Weidt (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Geisel wrote and illustrated an [[alphabet book]] featuring a collection of odd animals, but was unable to interest publishers in it.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weidt"/&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:MS Kungsholm 1928.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a luxury ocean liner.|Geisel conceived of the story aboard the luxury liner [[MS Kungsholm (1928)|MS ''Kungsholm'']] in 1936.]] --&gt;&lt;!-- Missing source for the image --&gt;

According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel conceived the core of ''Mulberry Street'' in the summer of 1936 aboard the [[MS Kungsholm (1928)|MS ''Kungsholm'']], a [[Swedish American Line|Swedish American]] luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, [[Helen Palmer (author)|Helen Palmer]]. As the ''Kungsholm'' endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with "a stupid horse and wagon".&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt; To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, "And that is a story that no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street." For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgans-based this account on interviews with Geisel, who had given similar accounts of the book's creation to journalists throughout his career, often omitting or altering various details. In one version, he had already been working on the book for six months before the European trip, and the trip home provided the final breakthrough. In another, he claimed he had the book about half finished when they landed in the US.&lt;ref name="Nel119"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;119–121&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisel, in his perfectionism, struggled with writing ''Mulberry Street''. According to the Morgans, "Although he lived for wit, his flights of fancy were subject to strict review."&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt; He spent at least six months on the book, questioning every word and writing numerous drafts. He wrote the poem out in pencil on yellow paper and asked his wife to discuss every page with him.&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt;

==Publication history==
Geisel submitted his finished manuscript, originally titled ''A Story No One Can Beat'', to dozens of publishers during the winter of 1936–37.&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt;{{efn|Geisel claimed, in varying accounts, that the manuscript was rejected by 20, 26, 27, 28, and 29 publishers.&lt;ref name="Nel1"/&gt; [[Alison Lurie]] later reported that 43 publishers had rejected the book.&lt;ref name="Lurie-69"&gt;Lurie (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt;}} Publishers posited a variety of criticisms of the book, including that fantasy was not salable, that children's books written in verse were out of style, and that the book lacked a clear moral message. According to the Morgans, Geisel angrily exclaimed to his wife, "What's wrong with kids having fun reading without being preached at?"&lt;ref name="Morgan-creation"/&gt; She cited the book's cartoon-like drawings and its story, which might be seen to encourage daydreaming and lying to one's parents, as possible reasons for its rejection.&lt;ref name="Lurie-69" /&gt;

According to Geisel, he was walking down [[Madison Avenue]] in New York City after learning of the latest rejection, planning to burn the manuscript when he got home, when he ran into Mike McClintock, an old [[Dartmouth College]] classmate.&lt;ref name="morgan-mcclintock"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt; McClintock had just become juvenile editor at [[Vanguard Press]] and took Geisel to his office to introduce him to Vanguard's President James Henle and editor Evelyn Shrifte. Henle had been gaining a reputation for signing authors whom other, larger publishers had rejected. He soon agreed to publish the book, with only the condition that its title be changed. Geisel cited the incident for his belief in luck and later stated, "If I had been walking down the other side of Madison Avenue, I'd be in the dry-cleaning business today."&lt;ref name="morgan-mcclintock" /&gt; In gratitude to McClintock, Geisel changed the name of the book's protagonist to Marco, after McClintock's son, and dedicated the book to McClintock's wife, Helene.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

In "an act of faith",&lt;ref name="morgan-publishing"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;83&lt;/ref&gt; Vanguard Press printed 15,000 copies of the book for its first printing. To promote the book, Henle bought a full-page advertisement in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', which reproduced the book's two-page spread of a reindeer pulling a cart and featured the line, "Book publishers, hitch on! This is the start of a parade that will take you places!" &lt;ref name="morgan-publishing"/&gt; Approximately two years later, Vanguard printed 6,000 more copies. By 1943, it had printed 31,600 copies, and Geisel's royalties were no more than $3,500.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; Although Geisel later moved to [[Random House]], Vanguard continued to publish ''Mulberry Street'' and his second book, ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'', until 1988, when Random House bought Vanguard.&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995 275"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;275&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel agreed to a slight rewording, renaming the character who appears near the end of the story a "Chinese man" instead of a "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]".&lt;ref name="Nel2"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;108–109&lt;/ref&gt; He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;276&lt;/ref&gt; However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines "Say&amp;mdash;''any''one could think of ''that'',/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat&amp;mdash;/ Say, even Jane could think of ''that''."&lt;ref name="Nel2"/&gt;

==Reception==
Hearing of its release, neighbors of Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book would be an exposé of the people there.  Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing.&lt;ref name="Krull"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krull|first=Kathleen|authorlink=Kathleen Krull|title=The Boy on Fairfield Street|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kh5HT8TXcV8C|year=2011|publisher=Random House Children's Books|isbn=978-0-307-55484-0}} (unpaginated)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clifton Fadiman]] wrote a one-sentence review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which Geisel could still quote near the end of his life: "They say it's for children, but better get a copy for yourself and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the little boy who exaggerated not wisely but too well."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;83–84&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"/&gt;

[[File:Beatrix Potter by King cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of a woman in a dress standing.|Children's book writer [[Beatrix Potter]] was among those who were enthusiastic about Seuss's first book.]]

[[Anne Carroll Moore]], then in charge of the children's section at the [[New York Public Library]], wrote an enthusiastic review in the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy."&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"/&gt; Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author [[Beatrix Potter]], who wrote back, "What an amusing picture book&amp;nbsp;... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness&amp;nbsp;... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!"&lt;ref name="morgan-reviews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written from the point of view of my mind, not the mind of a child."&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;Nichols (1962), p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Mulberry Street''{{'}}s sales grew significantly as the Dr. Seuss brand became more famous,&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995 275"/&gt; it is not one of Geisel's best-selling books.&lt;ref name=winerip&gt;{{cite news|last=Winerip|first=Michael|title=Mulberry Street May Fade, but 'Mulberry Street' Shines On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/education/dr-seuss-book-mulberry-street-turns-75.html|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, on the occasion of the book's 75th anniversary, Michael Winerip argued that later Dr. Seuss books were more entertaining and inventive than ''Mulberry Street'' but that it is nevertheless important as a harbinger of the many books that followed.&lt;ref name=winerip/&gt; [[A.&amp;nbsp;O. Scott]], in a 2000 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', contradicted this view, calling the book  "a hymn to the generative power of fantasy, a celebration of the sheer inventive pleasure of spinning an ordinary event into 'a story that no one can beat'."&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.&amp;nbsp;O.|title=Sense and Nonsense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/magazine/sense-and-nonsense.html|accessdate=November 2, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

=== Autobiographical elements and influences ===
[[File:Mulberry Street, Springfield MA.jpg|thumb|alt=A color photo. Down the middle runs a tree-lined sidewalk, with a fenced grassy area to the left and a street to the left, lined with houses.|Geisel was likely thinking of the real-life [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mulberry Street]] of the [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] of his youth.]]

Some writers have focused on ''Mulberry Street''{{'}}s connections to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life [[Mulberry Street (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mulberry Street]] in Springfield.&lt;ref name="winerip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/24/145471724/how-dr-seuss-got-his-start-on-mulberry-street|title=How Dr. Seuss Got His Start 'On Mulberry Street'|date=January 24, 2012|newspaper=[[NPR]]|author=NPR staff|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might have chosen the street mainly because of the sound and rhythm of its name.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 on the occasion of the book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation "there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may have taken him back."&lt;ref name="Nichols" /&gt; Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in ''Mulberry Street'' resemble [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood.&lt;ref name="winerip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/dr_seuss_and_to_think_that_i_s.html|title=Dr. Seuss' 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street' to turn 75 years old|last=Urban|first=Cori|date=July 7, 2012|newspaper=The Republican|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles [[Fordis C. Parker]], who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;City of Springfield (1922), ''Municipal Register of the City of Springfield'', Springfield, Ma.: City of Springfield, p.&amp;nbsp;908&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Cohen notes that, while the book mentions the intersection of Bliss and Mulberry Streets, their real-life counterparts in Springfield do not cross.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; Cohen connects the horse and wagon in ''Mulberry Street'' to Geisel's Springfield childhood and points to precursors of it in Geisel's earlier work. He traces the blue elephant in the book to the blue elephants that appear in Geisel's comic strip ''[[Hejji]]''. Philip Nel acknowledges ''Mulberry Street'' as the start of Geisel's particular, distinctive verse style and theorizes that he may have learned "the narrative power of meter and rhyme" from books he read as a child, including ''The Hole Book'' by [[Peter Newell]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nel (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Cott noted that ''Mulberry Street'' is similar to "[[Der Erlkönig]]", a German poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], "for both of them are about a father and a son and about the exigencies and power of the imagination."&lt;ref name="Cott 110"&gt;Cott (1983), p.&amp;nbsp;110&lt;/ref&gt; When Cott told Geisel about this, Geisel responded by quoting the first two lines of the poem, in German. He also noted that he was raised in a German-speaking home, minored in German in college, and had memorized the poem while in high school.&lt;ref name="Cott 110"/&gt;

Mary Galbraith makes a connection between ''Mulberry Street'' and Geisel's fears about the spread of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Nel1" /&gt; Geisel conceived of the story while returning from a European vacation that coincided with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, and Galbraith contends that in the book the "mayor's small mustache and raised arm evoke Hitler, while the brass band and international cast of characters evoke the parade of nations at the beginning of the games".&lt;ref name="Nel1"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/ref&gt;  She argues that the horse and wagon at the beginning of the story evokes the peaceful German Americans of Springfield, and by extension the non-threatening actions of Germany. As Marco's story evolves, the horse and wagon transform into a parade, which Galbraith equates with "a military monolith&amp;nbsp;... marching down main street as an airplane drops confetti."&lt;ref name="Nel1" /&gt;

=== Marco's relationship with his father ===
Some analyses have examined the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father at the end of the story suggests to the book's young readers that "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults",&lt;ref name="Lurie 1992 70"&gt;Lurie (1992), p.&amp;nbsp;70&lt;/ref&gt; a message that appears again in ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]''.&lt;ref name="Lurie 1992 70" /&gt;  To Matthew Pierlot, "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth",&lt;ref&gt;Pierlot (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Socrates]]-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is.&lt;ref&gt;Pierlot (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  To Patrick Shannon, "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world".&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon (1986), p.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of [[Maurice Sendak]] and [[William Steig]]; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.&lt;ref name="Shannon" /&gt;

Pastoral theologian Herbert Anderson has written that the child's perspective of reality in ''Mulberry Street'' can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal story of what happened on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural "openness to constructing a world".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt;  The child's untruthful response that he had not seen anything interesting on Mulberry Street is not out of disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2011), pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verse style ===
Nel notes that Geisel makes heavy use of [[anapestic tetrameter]] in ''Mulberry Street'' and many of his later books, citing the rhythm and draw of the books' language as a main reason for their appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thomas Fensch also notes the rollicking rhythm of the verse in ''Mulberry Street'' and Geisel's other books, writing, "Children can read the lines; they can sing the lines; they can ''SHOUT!'' the lines; they can dance to the lines."&lt;ref name="Fensch 68"&gt;Fensch (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; Fensch marks ''Mulberry Street'' as the start of what he calls "''escalating sequences'' or ''escalating action''", a technique Geisel used in most of his books, in which the action builds with each page. As Fensch put it, "The rhythm gallops&amp;mdash;the pictures move from left to right, toward the next page and the action builds."&lt;ref name="Fensch 68" /&gt;

===Artwork===

Geisel's drawings formed a part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated.&lt;ref name="Morgan-art"&gt;Morgan &amp; Morgan (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;84&lt;/ref&gt; By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read every word of the text.&lt;ref name="Nel66"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;66&lt;/ref&gt; By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use their imaginations to fill in gaps in the text.&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"/&gt; The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of ''Mulberry Street'', Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as "Why is the elephant blue?" or "Where did the airplane come from?"&lt;ref name="Nel66"/&gt;

In bold colors Geisel illustrated the surreal scenery&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"/&gt; and strange human and animal characters&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Ruth|title=Dr. Seuss|year=1988|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Twayne Publishers]]|isbn=0-8057-7524-2|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line&lt;ref name="Tunstall222"&gt;Tunstall (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nel3"/&gt; that remained familiar in his later works.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in ''Mulberry Street'', arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books to have a greater energy and looseness than in ''Mulberry Street'' or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as ''[[Horton Hatches the Egg]]'' (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's ''[[If I Ran the Zoo]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="Nel3"&gt;Nel (2004), p.&amp;nbsp;71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

Composer [[Deems Taylor]] adapted ''Mulberry Street'' into an orchestral work, ''Marco Takes a Walk''. The work opens with a theme that represents the horse and wagon, which is followed by six variations that represent the various changes in Marco's story. The work's premiere, conducted by [[Howard Barlow]], occurred at [[Carnegie Hall]] on November 14, 1942.&lt;ref name=pegolotti&gt;{{cite book|last=Pegolotti|first=James|title=Deems Taylor: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=North Eastern University Press|isbn=1-55553-587-9|pages=283–284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5G_Lqh3h4UC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961 the book was given the [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Miller (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
As ''Mulberry Street'' is Geisel's first children's book, Donald Pease calls it "the scene of origin for all of Dr. Seuss's children's books".&lt;ref&gt;Pease (2010), p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; After several books in prose, Geisel returned to verse for 1940's ''Horton Hatches the Egg'', using the same "galloping, rollicking, anapestic tetrameter rhyme scheme"&lt;ref name="Fensch1"&gt;Fensch (2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83&lt;/ref&gt; he had used for ''Mulberry Street''. In a later series of children's stories for ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine, Geisel reported "the latest news from Mulberry Street". In "Marco Comes Late", Marco attempts to explain why he is two hours late to school.&lt;ref name="Fensch1"/&gt;

Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of his home town in three later books, which, together with ''Mulberry Street'', form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle.&lt;ref name=Pease&gt;Pease (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;84–86&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[McElligot's Pool]]'' (1947), ''If I Ran the Zoo'' (1950), and ''[[If I Ran the Circus]]'' (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with "a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios."&lt;ref name=Pease/&gt; ''McElligot's Pool'' also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book.&lt;ref name=Pease/&gt;

When Geisel returned to Springfield in 1986 as part of a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street.&lt;ref name=rother&gt;{{cite news|last=Rother|first=Larry|title=After 60 Years, Dr. Seuss Goes Back to his Roots|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/us/after-60-years-dr-seuss-goes-back-to-his-roots.html|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 21, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of children held up a banner that read, "And to think that we saw him on Mulberry Street".&lt;ref name=rother/&gt; [[John Fogerty]], frontman for the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], has stated that the band's song "[[Lookin' Out My Back Door]]" was partly inspired by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordowitz|first=Hank|title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival|year=1998|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art competitions formed part of the modern [[Olympic Games]] during its early years, from 1912 to 1948.  The competitions were part of the original intention of the Olympic Movement's founder, [[Pierre de Coubertin|Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin]].  Medals were awarded for works of art inspired by [[sport]], divided into five categories: [[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]].

The [[Juried (competition)|juried]] art competitions were abandoned in 1954 because artists were considered to be professionals, while Olympic athletes were required to be amateurs. Since 1956, the [[Cultural Olympiad|Olympic cultural programme]] has taken their place.

==History==
With the founding of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894, and the celebration of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]], French Baron Pierre de Coubertin saw the fulfillment of his ideals—men being educated in both mind and body, and competing in sport rather than war. One of his other desires was to combine both art and sport, and he thus considered including artistic competition in the Olympic Games.

In May 1906, Baron de Coubertin organised a meeting in [[Paris]] for both IOC members and representatives of artists' organisations. The meeting ended with a proposal to the IOC to organise artistic competitions at the Olympic Games in five areas (architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture). The works of art entered had to be inspired by sports.

Preparations were underway to hold such competitions at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], which were scheduled for [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. But the Italian organisers were faced with financial troubles and were forced to halt preparations, and the IOC awarded the organisation to [[London]] in 1907. The British organisers planned to hold the art competitions, but because of the short preparation time, they were cancelled. The organisers felt that artists would not have enough time to send in their works.

Pierre de Coubertin was not discouraged, and sought to include the artistic events in the programme of the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], to be held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Although the Swedes initially objected, opposing the idea of art combined with competition, they eventually gave in. The number of entrants was rather disappointing: only 35 artists are known to have sent works of art to Sweden, but gold medals were awarded in all five categories.

When the first [[1920 Summer Olympics|post-war Olympic Games]] were held in war-ravaged [[Belgium]], art contests were again on the programme, although they were little more than a sideshow. This was different for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]]. The contests were taken seriously for the first time, and 193 artists submitted works. This figure included three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists, even though the Soviet Union officially did not take part in the Olympic Games, which they considered to be a "bourgeois" festival.

The growth continued at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam Olympics]], where over 1,100 works of art were exhibited in the [[Stedelijk Museum|Municipal Museum]], not including the submissions in literature, music and architecture. Artists were allowed to sell their works at the close of the exhibition, which was rather controversial given the IOC's amateurism policy, which required all competitors to be amateurs. In Amsterdam, the number of events was also increased, as four of the five fields of art were subdivided, creating more events.

Because of the economy and the remote location of [[Los Angeles]], participation in the athletic events of the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]] was lower than that of 1928. The art competition did not suffer from this problem, and the number of art works entered remained stable. Their exhibition drew 384,000 visitors to the [[Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art]]. Art contests were also held in [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin (1936)]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics|London (1948)]], with reasonable success, although the number of entered works had significantly dropped by 1948.

In 1949, a report was presented at the IOC meeting in Rome which concluded that practically all contestants in the art competitions were professionals, and that the competitions should therefore be abolished and replaced with an exhibition without awards or medals. This sparked a heated debate within the IOC. At a 1951 meeting, the IOC decided to reinstate the competitions for the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]]. However, the [[Finland|Finnish]] organisers claimed there was insufficient time, and an art competition was not held. An art exhibition took place in its stead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411091045/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue continued to be debated within the Olympic Movement, and at the 49th IOC Session in Athens, 1954, the IOC members voted to replace the art contests with an exhibition for future Olympics. Several attempts have been made to re-include them, but without success.

The Olympics continue to be connected with art exhibitions, however. The [[Olympic Charter]] required organisers of the Olympic Games to include a programme of cultural events, to "serve to promote harmonious relations, mutual understanding and friendship among the participants and others attending the Olympic Games".

==Competition==
From 1912 to 1948 rules of the art competition varied, but the core of the rules remained the same. All of the entered works had to be inspired by sport, and had to be original (that is, not be published before the competition). Like in the athletic events at the Olympics, gold, silver, and bronze medals were awarded to the highest ranked artists, although not all medals were awarded in each competition. On a few occasions, in fact, no medals were presented at all.

Generally, it was permitted for artists to enter multiple works, although a maximum number was sometimes established. This made it possible for an artist to win multiple prizes in a single competition.

At one time or another, there were suggestions to also include [[dancing]], [[film]], [[photography]], or [[theatre]], but none of these art forms was ever included in the Olympic Games as a medal event.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Amsterdam Olympisch Stadion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1928 Olympic Stadium, designed by Jan Wils, won the gold medal in architecture at the 1928 Olympics.]]

Until the Amsterdam Games in 1928, the architectural competition was not divided into categories. The 1928 games introduced a town planning category. However, the division was not always clear, and some designs were awarded prizes in both categories.

Entries in this category were allowed to have been "published" before the Olympics. A notable example of this is the 1928 gold medal for architecture awarded to [[Jan Wils]] for his design of the Olympic Stadium used in the same Olympics.

===Literature===
The literature competitions were divided into a varied number of categories. Until 1924 and again in 1932, there was only a single literature category. In 1928, separate categories were introduced for [[drama]]tic, [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] literature. Awards in these categories were also presented in 1948, while the drama category was dropped in 1936.

Entered works were limited in length (20,000 words) and could be submitted in any language, provided they were accompanied by [[English language|English]] and/or [[French language|French]] translations or summaries (rules varied over the years).

===Music===
A single event for music was held until 1936, when three categories were introduced: one for [[orchestral]] music, one for [[instrumental]] music, and one for both [[solo (music)|solo]] and [[choir|choral]] music. In 1948, these categories were slightly modified into choral/orchestral, instrumental/[[chamber music|chamber]], and [[vocal music]].

The juries often had trouble judging the pieces, which were entered on paper. Possibly related to the problematic judging, juries frequently decided to award only a few prizes. On two occasions, no award was given out at all (in the 1924 music category and in the 1936 instrumental music category).

1936 marked the only occasion when the winning musical works were actually played before an audience.

[[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]] is the only well-known musician to have competed, winning a silver medal in 1932.

===Painting===
[[Image:Rugby by Jean Jacoby.png|thumb|200px|right|Jean Jacoby is the only artist to win two gold medals. He won his second with the above drawing, titled ''Rugby''.]]

As with the other art forms, a single painting category was on the program until 1928, when it was split out into three sub-categories: [[drawing]]s, [[graphic art]]s, and paintings. The categories then changed at each of the following Olympic Games. In 1932, the three categories were: paintings, [[printmaking|prints]], and [[watercolor]]s/drawings. Four years later, the prints category had disappeared, and had been replaced by graphic arts and commercial graphic art. At the final Olympic art competition, the three categories were applied arts and crafts, [[engraving]]s/[[etching]]s, and oils/water colours.

===Sculpture===
The sculpture class had only a single category until 1928, when two separate competitions were designated; one for [[statue]]s and one for [[relief]]s and [[medal]]s. In 1936, this was split up further, separating reliefs and medals into their own categories.

==Competitors==
While several of the Olympic art medallists have achieved at least national fame, few of them can be considered well-known artists globally. In fact, the 1924 Games featured better known jury members than artists, with artists like [[Selma Lagerlöf]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]] judging the entered works.

Judging by the medals won, [[Luxembourg]] painter [[Jean Jacoby]] is the most successful Olympic artist, winning the gold medal for his 1924 painting ''Étude de Sport'', and for his drawing ''Rugby'' in 1928. [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alex Diggelmann]] won three medals, a gold one in 1936 (for his poster ''Arosa I Placard''), and a silver and a bronze in the 1948 applied arts &amp; crafts class, both with commercial posters. [[Denmark|Danish]] writer [[Josef Petersen]] won a silver medal on three occasions: in 1924, 1932, and 1948.

[[Image:Hajos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alfréd Hajós is one of only two Olympians to have won medals in both sport and art competitions]]

Only two persons have won Olympic medals in both sport and art competitions. [[Walter W. Winans]], an [[United States|American]] who lived in England, won a gold medal as a [[shooting|marksman]] at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in the running deer (double shot) competition. In 1912, he won another shooting medal—silver this time—in the running deer team competition. By then, he had already won a gold medal for his sculpture ''An American trotter''. The other Olympian with successes in both fields is [[Alfréd Hajós]] of [[Hungary]]. As a [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]], he won two gold medals at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens Olympics]]. Twenty-eight years later, he was awarded a silver medal in architecture for his stadium design, co-designed with [[Dezső Lauber]].

Two presidents of the International Olympic Committee have also been among the entrants in the Olympic art competitions. In 1912 [[Pierre de Coubertin]], under the [[pseudonym]] "Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach", entered ''Ode to sport'', which won the gold medal. [[Avery Brundage]], who competed as an athlete at the 1912 Games, entered literary works at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, earning an honorary mention in 1932. He would serve as the IOC's president from 1952 to 1971.

Britain's [[John Copley (artist)|John Copley]], winner of a silver medal in the 1948 engravings and etchings competition, was 73 years of age, making him the oldest Olympic medallist in history. The oldest Olympic medallist outside the art competitions is [[Sweden|Swedish]] shooter [[Oscar Swahn]], who won his last medal at age 72.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6406">'''Axel Brauns''' (born 2 July 1963) is a German writer and [[filmmaker]].

== Biography ==
Brauns was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, and spent the first two years of his life in the quarter [[Eimsbüttel (quarter)|Eimsbüttel]]. In 1965, his family moved to [[Hamburg-Groß Flottbek]]. There Brauns went to a kindergarten, an elementary school and a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]], where he did his ''[[Abitur]]'' at 19&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Katharina.

[[:de:Grin Verlag|Grin Verlag]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-3638775748}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then began studying for a degree in Business Administration and Law at the [[University of Hamburg]], but left it in 1984, to focus solely on writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoffmann-und-campe.de/autoren-info/axel-brauns/ |title=Autoren Details |publisher=HOFFMANN UND CAMPE VERLAG |language=German |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Brauns founded a literary salon, and since 2002, he has been working as a [[tax advisor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literatura-online.cz/pestrostini-a-netopyri-brauns-axel/ |title=Pestrostíni a netopýři (Brauns Axel) |date=20 February 2011 |publisher=Literatura on-line.cz |language=Czech |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career as writer and filmmaker ===
Brauns, who has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], wrote an autobiography called ''Buntschatten und Fledermäuse&amp;nbsp;– Leben in einer anderen Welt'' (''Coloured Shadows and Bats&amp;nbsp;– Living in Another World''), which spans the years from 1965 to 1983, and presents his view of the world. He won the [[:de:Hamburger Förderpreise für Literatur und literarische Übersetzungen|Literaturförderpreis der Stadt Hamburg]] for an excerpt from it, after which [[Hoffmann und Campe]] offered to publish it. ''Coloured Shadows and Bats'' came out in 2002, and reached the bestseller list of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 April 2002 |title=DER SPIEGEL 18/2002&amp;nbsp;– Bestseller |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-22213366.html |language=German |newspaper=Der Spiegel |location=Hamburg |publisher=Spiegel-Verlag |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Brauns was nominated for the [[Deutscher Bücherpreis]], in the category "Most successful debut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 September 2002 |title=Deutscher Bücherpreis 2003: Butt-Verleihung im neuen Gewand |url= http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/deutscher-buecherpreis-2003-butt-verleihung-im-neuen-gewand-a-216049.html |language=German |newspaper=SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel-Verlag |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Brauns produced his first [[feature film]], called ''Tsunami und Steinhaufen''. It premiered in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.de/title/tt0800243/ |title=Tsunami und Steinhaufen (2008) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, Brauns's novel ''Kraniche und Klopfer'' came out. It tells the story of a fictional girl named Adina Adelung, who lives in a house with her brother and mother. Her mother constantly brings rubbish (to which she is addicted) into her house. Eventually, Adina finds the path for a new life by meeting a woman called Erla Meier, who takes her to see cranes in a natural reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leselupe.de/blog/2005/04/08/Kraniche-und-Klopfer/ |title=Kraniche und Klopfer |author=Rau, Heike |date=8 April 2005 |publisher=Rezensionen, Buchbesprechungen und mehr auf Leselupe.de! |language=German |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cafeterias del Malecón''' is an architectural project created by the (e)spacios Cuban design group and was shown for the first time at the Architecture [[wikt:biennale|Biennial]] of [[Havana]] in May 2004. It is composed of 5 ephemeral cafeterias, the design of each being inspired by the work of famous Cuban painters.

== The (e)spacios Group ==
The group was founded in 1998, and is composed of the architect Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia and of designers Raidán Valdés Hung and Maikel Sánchez. Their office is situated in [[Old Havana]]. The group’s aim is to erase the border between art, design and architecture.

== The project ==
Vilma Bartolomé Arencibia is the one who first came up with the idea of the [[Malecón]] project. Seeing that every time a building was demolished a cafeteria replaced it, she thought the group could come up with a new style and aesthetics.

With the help of designer Sulumi Sánchez Herrera, the (e)spacios group offered to create five ephemeral cafeterias, made of canvases stretched over metal frameworks. The design of these cafeterias was inspired by the work of five Cuban artists : [[Roberto Fabelo]], Ángel Ramírez, Arturo Montoto, [[Esterio Segura]] and Alfredo Sosabravo. Each cafeteria presents a specificity : the one based on the work of the artist Roberto Fabelo is specialized in seafood; another, inspired by Arturo Montoto’s work and whose theme is “fruity”, only sells vegetarian products etc.

The plans have been showcased at the Architecture Biennial of [[Havana]] in 2004 and received a warm welcoming from locals and art dealers.

'''''Christmas in the Brothel''''' ({{lang-no|'''Julaften i bordell'''}}) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]]. The Expressionist painting was completed in 1903–04 and is housed at the [[Munch Museum]] in Oslo.

==Background==
The painting was done at a difficult time for Munch: a commission for a portrait in Hamburg (of a Senator Holthusen, the father in law of Munch's patron [[Max Linde]]) had come to naught because of disagreements. As a result, Munch suffered anxieties, which he attempted to manage with alcohol. A visit to a brothel in Lübeck is supposedly the background to ''Christmas in the Brothel'', a "light yet melancholy" painting in which the working girls in a brothel have just finished decorating a Christmas tree. "Ironic, sentimentally unholy", the painting is interpreted as a commentary on both Linde's upper-class household (where Munch was staying at the time) and Munch's own "pietistic home background".&lt;ref name="Bischoff2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bischoff|first=Ultich|title=Edvard Munch, 1863–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETahibk334cC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=9783822859711|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other paintings of the period, it shows Munch's association with [[Fauvism]].&lt;ref name="Clement1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clement|first=Russell T|title=Les Fauves: a sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=9780313283338|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was a favored topic of Munch's, and one particular room in a German brothel would later inspire an entire series of paintings, ''The Green Room''.&lt;ref name="Ringdal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ringdal|first=Nils Johan|title=Love for Sale: A World History of Prostitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYTW_eUOAesC&amp;pg=PA251|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=Grove|isbn=9781555848088|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other|Cressida (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Kirk-TroilusCressidaAct1.jpg|thumb|Cressida depicted by Thomas Kirk]]
'''Cressida''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɛ|s|ᵻ|d|ə}}; also '''Criseida''', '''Cresseid''' or '''Criseyde''') is a character who appears in many [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] retellings of the story of the [[Trojan War]]. She is a Trojan woman, the daughter of [[Calchas]], a Greek seer. She falls in love with [[Troilus]], the youngest son of King [[Priam]], and pledges everlasting love, but when she is sent to the Greeks as part of a hostage exchange, she forms a liaison with the Greek warrior [[Diomedes]]. In later culture she becomes an archetype of a faithless lover.

==Character history==
{{refimprove|date=June 2018}}
The character's name is derived from that of [[Chryseis]], a character who appears in the ''[[Iliad]]'' but has no connection with Troilus, Diomedes or Calchas. Indeed, the story of Troilus and Cressida does not appear in any Greek legends but was invented by the twelfth century French poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] in the ''[[Roman de Troie]]''. The woman in the [[love triangle]] is here called not Cressida but [[Briseida]], a name derived from that of [[Briseis]], a different character in the ''Iliad'', who again is neither related to Calchas nor involved in any love affairs with Troilus or Diomedes. Initially, after the ''Roman'' appeared, other authors who refer to the story, for example, [[Azalais d'Altier]] in her poem ''Tanz salutz e tantas amors'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]] in his ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', continue to use names derived from that of Briseis.

It is the Italian author and poet [[Boccaccio]] who makes the decisive shift in the character's name in ''[[Il Filostrato]]''. This poem is the first work dedicated to telling the story of the love triangle rather than to the larger tale of the Trojan War. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is an expanded version of the story based on Boccaccio. Several other authors then took up the tale, including the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] poet [[Robert Henryson]] in his ''[[The Testament of Cresseid]]'', which 'completes' Cressida's story (left unfinished by Chaucer), and [[William Shakespeare]] in his play of the Trojan War, ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

Cressida has most often been depicted by writers as "false Cressida", a paragon of female inconstancy. As soon as she has betrayed Troilus, she has fulfilled her purpose and the men who have written about her do not mention her again. Such is the case in Benoît, Guido, Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare. Chaucer's poem, however, at least portrays a more sympathetic Criseyde showing a self-conscious awareness of her literary status: "Alas, of me until the world's end shall be wrote no good song". Henryson's treatment is unusual in that he looks at events after the end of the traditional tale. His poem takes up the repentant Cresseid's story after she has developed leprosy and been abandoned by Diomedes. 

Some authors have attempted to exonerate the character by having her choose Troilus over Diomedes. Such is the case in [[John Dryden]]'s rewriting of Shakespeare in an attempt at {{nowrap|"remov[ing]}} that heap of Rubbish, under which many excellent thoughts lay bury'd".&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, John ''Preface to Troilus and Cressida'' in: Novak, M. E (ed.) (1984). ''The Works of John Dryden: Volume XIII Plays: All for Love; Oedipus; Troilus and Cressida''. Berkeley, Cal.: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-05124-6}}. p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Walton]] and [[Christopher Hassall]]'s 1954 opera ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'' did likewise. In both of these cases, Cressida's being true to Troilus is associated with her death as part of the concluding tragic events.

Other modern fiction has introduced further departures from the traditional narrative. [[Christa Wolf]] in ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Cassandra]]'' provides another degraded future for the character (once more named Briseis), by including her eventual enslavement to [[Achilles]] and then [[Agamemnon]]. [[Jack Lindsay]]'s novel ''Cressida's First Lover: A Tale of Ancient Greece'' explores another area untouched in standard narratives, some of her earlier life.

==Shakespeare==
In Shakespeare's ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', we first hear of Cressida in Act 1 Scene 1. [[Pandarus]] and Troilus are discussing how the latter's unspoken love for the former's niece, Cressida, is preventing him from performing on the battlefield. She first appears in person in the following scene, speaking to her manservant before Pandarus enters. They commence into witty banter while a parade of Trojan soldiers heads past. When Troilus walks by Pandarus tries to convince Cressida of his merit, but she teases him, saying she has heard [[Achilles]], a Grecian warrior, is far more impressive. Once Pandarus exits Cressida admits in a [[soliloquy]] that she does in fact love Troilus, but is worried about publicising it. In her own words:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Yet I hold off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungained more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
"Achievement is command; ungained, beseech."
That though my heart's contents firm love doth bear,
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 1 Scene 2, lines 225–234
}}

She next appears in Act 3 Scene 2, when Pandarus leads her on stage wearing a veil to meet with Troilus. Pandarus then heads back "inside" and the two are left alone. Cressida struggles to practise her [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] as planned while Troilus professes his love for her. When Pandarus re-enters she eventually admits her own reciprocal love of Troilus. In a confused speech she battles with her own fate as a woman, even speaking in a collective woman's voice, revealing a greater intelligence than the male characters give her credit for:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;I love you now; but till now not so much
But I might master it; in faith, I lie:
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us,
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But, though I loved you well, I wooed you not,
And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man,
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 3 Scene 2, lines 92–101
}}

Cressida becomes increasingly affected by her own qualities, saying 'I show more craft than love' (line 124). She begs to be allowed to leave, but Troilus and Pandarus want her to stay, so that they can marry to immediate effect. She seems to prophesise her own failings, repeating the word 'false' seven times before Pandarus 'seals' the match. In Act 4 Scene 2 we see the couple on the morning after their first night together. They are euphoric, but Cressida does not want Troilus to leave her, showing an awareness of her own vulnerability in that moment. On line 20, she says 'you men will never tarry' as he begins to contemplate leaving. Pandarus enters and cracks some jokes about how she had now lost her innocence, and Cressida is flustered. Once Troilus and Cressida are dressed, Aeneas visits in a panic to say that for the return of one of Troy's men from the Greeks, Antenor, they must trade Cressida over to Diomedes, a Greek general. Cressida becomes an object to trade, and Troilus does nothing to prevent the sad event, though he is miserable for it. In Act 4 Scene 4 Cressida is informed of the plans to trade her to the Greeks. Troilus gives her his sleeve as a love token and she gives him a glove. Their relationship becomes an inversion of Paris and Helen's. Diomedes enters and Cressida is handed over.

In the following scene we again see Cressida in a less vulnerable state. Although she is now being led through the Greek encampment by Diomedes, surrounded by men, she engages with the men, Ulysses in particular, with defensive banter. Ulysses predicts her behaviour using coarse phrases such as "sluttish spoils". Act 5 Scene 2 is the most poignant scene containing Cressida, and the most memorable. Troilus has crept into the camp and is accompanied by Ulysses, and they are watch the scene unfolding between Diomedes and Cressida unnoticed. Thersites is also present and unseen, the clown of dark humour making distasteful comments exaggerating the sexual inference of what he sees. Cressida flirts with Diomedes, yet is occasionally struck by guilt. She appears to lust after him, even giving him Troilus's sleeve as a love token, though quickly tries to retrieve it from him in a struggle, offering her own body in trade. Diomedes insists he will have both. He exits, having planned a return visit. Troilus is mad with jealousy and anger throughout the scene, but she never realises he is close by. Her final lines of the play are:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee,
But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah, poor our sex! This fault in us I find,
The error of our eye doth direct our mind:
What error leads must err. O, then conclude
Minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 5 Scene 2, lines 122–127
}}

Later, we are told of things that concern her: for example, the letter Troilus receives which he tears up, and Troilus' horse which Diomedes sends to her as a prize after knocking him out of the saddle in battle.

===Contemporary criticism===
''Troilus and Cressida'' has little performance history prior to the 20th century.  Cressida's character is as isolated from framing as the rest of the story—we never know how her life ends, there is no "ever after" for her, and even her beginning is mysterious to us. She appears a witty young girl, only to become a serious, thoughtful, and thought-provoking woman in moments of reflection. Carol Rutter explores the reasons why Cressida is so fascinating. She writes "[...] the challenge Shakespeare constructs for this play is to put before us a Cressida, who, like the fair (but dark) lady of the sonnets is, in Eve Sedgwick's memorable term, 'oxymoron militant', a genuine contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;Chillington Rutter, Carol. ''Enter the Body''. Routledge. Great Britain, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutter has much to say on Cressida's self-awareness. Firstly, that Cressida is unique, that she "is something entirely, radically new, the woman who behaves like a man, who betrays the man," secondly, that, "two voices seem to be speaking [...] Where has Cressida learnt this 'instruction'? [...] the speech is neurotic, pragmatic, anti-romantic – yet its form is a sonnet [...] it discloses strategic schizophrenia [...] by this agenda, to win at love, a woman must play false, act double. She must separate instinct from sexual performance [...]".&lt;ref&gt;Chillington Rutter, Carol. ''Enter the Body''. Routledge. Great Britain, 2001. pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliet Stevenson]] commented in Rutter's book ''Clamorous Voices'' that such roles inspire an actor to "react against the way tradition and prejudice have stigmatised them – Cressida the whore [...] every time they're judged you feel protective. Perhaps too protective. So you might end up playing a Cressida who is above reproach."&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, Carol. ''Clamorous Voices Shakespeare's Women Today''. The Women's Press Limited. London, 1988. p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main question as regards Shakespeare's Cressida is centralised around whether she is simply a "whore", or if she is more complex, and worth further attention due to her obvious intelligence and duality.

== In popular culture ==

In "[[The Myth Makers]]", a 1965 storyline by  [[Donald Cotton]] in the [[Time travel|time-travel]]–based British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the character [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] (played by [[Maureen O'Brien]]), a teenaged travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], meets [[Priam]], King of [[Troy]] who, disliking her name, dubs her Cressida. During the course of the story, Vicki/Cressida falls in love with Priam's son Troilus, and after the fall of Troy elects to stay with Troilus and rebuild the city. The story inverts the traditional fates of Troilus and Cressida, a change made to facilitate the departure of the Vicki character (and actress O'Brien) from the series.

The named ''Cressida'' is sometimes given, as a literary [[allusion]], as a first name to faithless characters.  For example, in ''[[Mockingjay]]'', the final novel in [[Suzanne Collins]]'s ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' series, the character Cressida betrays the Capitol to support the rebellion, then later double-crosses the rebellion.  In the movie ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', a flashback scene shows the character of Cressida Baylor (played by Robinne Lee) betray the fidelity of the main character Hitch (played by [[Will Smith]]), thus negatively affecting his judgement and attitude toward love and women.

The progressive rock band [[Cressida (band)|Cressida]] is named after the character.

Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans,&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt; and a loose striped over-garment called a ''shamma''.  Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and [[sistrum|sistra]] outside the church or the [[synagogue]] during religious services.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p52-53" /&gt;

=== Among the Beta Israel ===
Among the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a [[kahen]]. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of ''debtra''), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a ''debtera''.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute of Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109-135 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among Christians ===
''Kahens'' and ''debteras'' are two separate professions,&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay|title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-744-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible to pursue both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crummey|first=Donald|title=Land and Society in the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: From the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0w6h0qHGMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02482-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milkias|first=Paulos|title=Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu9mnXhvSswC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-258-6|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lenten services, ''debteras'' tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm.  The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of ''debteras'', citing the story in [[2 Kings]] of [[David]] dancing at the temple and {{Bibleverse||Psalm|47:1|KJV}} ("[[Psalm 47|O clap your hands]]") for Biblical examples.  These performances also feature symbols connected to the [[Passion of Jesus]]: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the [[flagellation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47" /&gt;

== Religio-Magical Healing ==
Debteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers.&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"&gt;Janetius, S.T. Abyssinia in the New Millennium (Revised Edition), 2016. {{ISBN|9783659710629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=pammUsXz-J&amp;dq=famous%20dabtaras&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=famous%20dabtaras&amp;f=false "Healer," Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, by Siegbert Uhlig, publ. by Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also reputed to study [[black magic]] invoking [[demon]]s alongside their more benevolent official learning.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

Some Debteras manufacture [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[amulet]]s meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;  These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary [[Buda (folk religion)|budas]], [[zār]] spirits, and the [[evil eye]].  They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, [[prayer]]s, and exorcisms.  These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of [[holy water]] (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a ''Magic Star Book''.&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;  Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/?q=ethiopian-magic-scroll Description of Ethiopian Magic Scroll] at [[Portland State University]]'s [http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/ Medieval Portland site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some practice (or rather circumvent) [[astrology]], by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names.  This may be considered "cheating" by the locals, however.  Some Debteras have also been noted to use [[Datura stramonium]] to cause hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J00xEkY-vTEC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=debtera&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=debtera&amp;f=false A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis By G-m G-m Lulat, ABC-CLIO, 30 Aug 2005, p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Debteras duties and cures are [[supernatural]].  Debteras place [[scarecrow]]s in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent [[lice]] outbreaks.&lt;ref name="Finneran" /&gt;  Before the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Abyssinia-New-Millennium-Dr-Janetius/dp/1522757716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"/&gt;

'''''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem''''' is a 1617 [[oil painting]] by [[Flanders|Flemish]] artist [[Anthony van Dyck]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts [[Jesus]] entering [[Jerusalem]] as described in the [[Gospels]], the event celebrated on [[Palm Sunday]].&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Van Dyck's presentation of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is quite consistent with the biblical accounts. The [[donkey|ass]] foal he rides is almost entirely enveloped by his robes of rich blue and crimson. He is surrounded by his disciples on foot, and jubilantly welcomed by a crowd of locals who lay branches in his path. It is a very youthful, vigorous work, full of bright colors and slashing brushstrokes. The restlessness and muscularity of the figures are very [[Baroque]].&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; The [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]] and large size of figures gives them tremendous immediacy, lending drama to the narrative.&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

==Historical information==
Painted when van Dyck was only about 18, ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'' demonstrates his early mastery of the medium. He was already [[Peter Paul Rubens]]' principal assistant. While already working on developing his own, more robust style, van Dyck was heavily influenced by Rubens, as can be seen in the vibrant colors, dynamic composition, and grand scale.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition history===
From November 2012 to March 2013, this painting was on display at the [[Prado]] as part of an exhibit called "The Young van Dyck." Covering his output from ages 16 to 22, this exhibit collected some 90 artworks from when he resided in [[Antwerp]]. This tally included 30 large, ambitious artworks like ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem.''&lt;ref name=ahn&gt;{{cite web|last=Kantrowitz|first=Jonathan|title=The Young Van Dyck|url=http://arthistorynewsreport.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-young-van-dyck.html|publisher=Art History News|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular work, though, was noted as one of his most experimental, as the young artist sought to heighten the visual impact of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The young Anthony Van Dyck at the Prado Museum|url=http://www.artlistings.com/art-news/3368-the-young-anthony-van-dyck-at-the-prado-museum-/|publisher=Art Listings|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acquisition===
''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'' was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Herman C. Krannert in 1958 as a gift for the [[Herron School of Art]], which later evolved, in part, into the IMA. It is currently on view in the William C. Griffith Jr. and Carolyn C. Griffith Gallery and has the accession number 58.3.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry of Christ into Jerusalem|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/entry-christ-jerusalem-dyck-anthony-van|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.107.13 Epa Mask.jpg|thumbnail|Epa Mask, collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
An '''Epa mask''' is a ceremonial mask worn by the [[Yoruba people]] of [[Nigeria]] during the Epa masquerade. Carvings representing priests, hunters, farmers, kings, and mothers are usually depicted on the masks. They are used to acknowledge important roles within the community, and to honor those who perform the roles, as well as ancestors who performed those roles in the past.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=70|url=http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171202/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/gutoco.html|archivedate=2011-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not being used during performances, Epa masks are kept in shrines where they are the focus of prayers and offerings from community elders.&lt;ref name=BMA /&gt;

==History==
Epa masks originated from the seventeen kingdoms which make up the [[Ekiti State|Ekiti region]] in the north-east of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] territory. Unlike other parts of Yorubaland, Ekiti has been subject to extensive foreign influences. The area received successive waves of immigration from [[Ife]] in the sixteenth century and from the [[Bini people|Bini]] in the seventeenth, as well as being the target of military raids from [[Ilorin]] and [[Ibadan]] in the middle or late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Forde&gt;{{cite book|last=Forde|first=D.|title=Yoruba Speaking People of Southwest Nigeria|year=1951|publisher=International African Institute|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the area was considered to have formed part of the [[Benin empire]].&lt;ref name=Akintoye&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akintoye|first=S.A.|title=The Benin Kingdom and the north-eastern districts of Yoruba country|journal=JAHSN|year=1969|volume=4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, its population has a complex mixed ethnic origin which has given rise to some unique traditions not previously found elsewhere in Yorubaland but which have since spread to the [[Iyagba]], [[Igbomina]], [[Oshun]], [[Owo]] and [[Ijesha]] regions. It is also not surprising to find that the warrior figures often surmounting Epa masks represent heroes who proved their mettle during this long period of instability.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Anthony|title=A Yoruba Epa Mask by Fasiku Alaye|journal=Journal of Museum Ethnography|year=1998|volume=10|pages=121–124|publisher=Museum Ethnographers Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Epa masks consist of a [[Janus]] faced helmet and an often elaborate figurative superstructure usually carved with a female or equestrian figure at its center. Surrounding the central figure are typically smaller figures, representing  traders, musicians, hunters and other personages central to Yoruba community life. Many Epa masks bear names like 'Mother with Children', 'Owner of Many Children', 'Children Cover Me' (like a protecting cloth), 'Children are Honorable to Have', 'Bringer of Children', 'Mother of Twins', 'Nursing Mother' and many other similar appellations, which occur in the songs that accompany the dancers.&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ojo|first=J.R.|title=The symbolism and significance of Epa-type masquerade headpieces|journal=Man |series=New Series|year=1978|volume=13|issue=457470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet is always simply carved, often with two faces, and is reminiscent of a mortar or pot. Such similarities are made explicit in the term for the helmet, ''tkiko'' ('pot'), alluding to it as a container of spiritual power and otherworldly force, [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. The eyes of one face are usually carved open, looking out to the world of the living, while those on the other are sealed, contemplating the realm of the divine and the ancestors. Much [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ceremonial is concerned with the control and focusing of this divine force for the benefit of the community. The control and focusing of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] is a central theme throughout the different episodes that make up the Epa festival as well as apparently constituting a theme in other ceremonies in which Epa masks are used. The equestrian figures from episodes from the region's turbulent history incorporate representations of the channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] to safeguard the conquering hero. Maternity figures invoke [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for increasing procreative abilities and fertility, while references to medicine also express the dependence of personal well-being on the judicial channeling of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Perhaps, then, the iconographic clue to the meaning of Epa masks is not to be found in their elaborate superstructures, but in the crude pot helmet itself as a manifestation of the efficacy of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] for communal and personal well-being.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Ritual Context==
In north-west [[Yorubaland]] the Epa masks are kept by the head of a lineage or a town chief on behalf of the lineage or community. When in use they are choreographed as emerging from the bush, where they return once 
the festival is completed. Offerings may be made to a mask before it is used or during the ceremony. According to Robert Thompson, 'the Epa cult stresses the transformation of young men into stalwart specimens 
able to bear pain and shoulder heavy weight'.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African Art in Motion|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles and Berkeley|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Arowolo of lloro distinguished between the type of energy belonging to the cult of [[Elefon]], concerned with ancestral spirits, and the cult of Epa, connected with the dignified, slow and patient masquerades of ancient men and culture heroes.&lt;ref name=Heyden&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heyden|first=M.V.|title=The Epa mask and ceremony|journal=African Arts X|year=1977|volume=2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] Yoruba share their principal deities with Yoruba from elsewhere, they also have many deities and masquerades  peculiar to themselves, leading other fieldworkers to note that the distinction is less clear than Thompson suggested.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; In north-eastern Yorubaland, Epa and other masks are used in annual ceremonies, held in February or March in some places or as late as September in others to promote the fertility and well-being of the community.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; They also appear in Elefon festivals performed to celebrate the return of the warriors, to honor [[Ogoun|Ogun]], the god of war and iron and to mark the growth of new crops. Elsewhere such masks were used in post-burial rites relating to titled men. In one fairly consistent episode in the festival the masquerader, supporting a mask which can often weigh 50&amp;nbsp;lbs or more, attempts to jump off a mound to augur the quality of the new year. A fall or loss of balance is read as a bad omen which may herald coming misfortune.&lt;ref name=Shelton /&gt;

==Epa Masquerade==
Early writers interpreted Epa ceremonies as entirely focused on fertility.&lt;ref name="Fagg &amp; Eliosofson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagg|first=W. &amp; E. Eliosofson|title=The Sculpture of Africa|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp;  Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have found the ceremonies to be equally concerned with warriors and the medicine God [[Osanyin]], relating them to both physical and spiritual security.&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=K|title=Yoruba Religious Carving: Pagan and Christian Sculpture in Nigeria and Dahomey|year=1967|publisher=: Geoffrev Chapma|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojo,&lt;ref name=Ojo /&gt; following Carroll,&lt;ref name=Carroll /&gt; has proposed that at one level the ceremonies incorporate the re-enactment of historical events. In a ceremony recorded by Heyden in [[Ekiti State|lloro, Ekiti]], masks surmounted by female figures were identified as the wives of the warrior [[Okotorojo]], represented by an animal mask resembling a goat or antelope. Okotorojo, the principal figure in the festival, was chained to another man described as either having the duty to restrain the wild powers of the warrior or, paradoxically, as the representative of the power ([[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]) of [[Eleda]], who always remains behind the warrior to render him invincible in battle.&lt;ref name=Heyden /&gt;

'''''Game for Vultures''''' is a 1979 British [[thriller film]] starring [[Richard Harris]], [[Joan Collins]] and [[Richard Roundtree]]. It was directed by [[James Fargo]] and based on a novel by [[Michael Hartmann (judge)|Michael Hartmann]] set during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].

==Plot==
During the late 1970s, as the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] reaches its height, [[Arms trafficking|arms dealer]] David Swansey (Richard Harris) is a "sanctions busting" specialist, one of many who keeps the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] supplied through black market purchases despite an extensive international arms embargo. Swansey's latest assignment is to arrange the illicit purchase of military helicopters, which he acquires in the form of surplus [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Bell UH-1]]s being auctioned from a [[United States Air Force]] base in [[West Germany]]. However, word of this transaction is soon leaked to a foreign office of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), which applies strong political pressure in an attempt to kill the deal in its cradle. Due to this, the helicopters are barred from reaching Rhodesia and instead diverted to neighbouring [[South West Africa]].

Meanwhile, Gideon Marunga (Roundtree) is a guerrilla fighter in the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), ZANU's armed wing. Marunga learns that the South West African authorities are going to allow Swansey and the [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] to stage a mock raid on the airfield where the helicopters are being stored, with the intention of loading them onto [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakotas]] bound for Rhodesia. On the day of the raid, Marunga arrives at the airfield and stalls the Rhodesian troops, while his accomplices succeed in destroying half of the helicopters. In the ensuing battle he comes face to face with Swansey, and the two men share a weary moment of reflection on their stalemate before abruptly parting ways.

The international fallout from the helicopter affair exposes Swansey's illegal activities and he finds himself unable to continue conducting business outside Rhodesia. He decides to permanently settle there and pursue a normal life, but is immediately conscripted into the security forces. The film closes as Marunga and Swansey confront each other on the battlefield again&amp;mdash;this time through the sights of their rifles.

==Production==
''Game for Vultures'' was the first British film about the Rhodesian Bush War.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

The film was mostly shot in South Africa, near [[Pretoria]] and [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name="game"&gt;BRIEFLY South Africa bans film
The Globe and Mail [Toronto, Ont] 1 June 1979: P.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THE 'AFRICAN': The Drums Are Beating in them World's Movie Studios for Black and White 'Westerns' Drums Are Beating By Bart Mills. The Washington Post (1974-Current file) [Washington, D.C] 3 June 1979: L1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided not to film in Rhodesia itself because of security concerns and the potential violation of sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19781030&amp;id=KUtOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Gu4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4897,6224621&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

"I'm not a politician", said the producer Hazel Adair. The director James Fargo concurred: "I'm not a political person at all. I never thought about Africa until I started to make a film... The audience will come away with the idea that neither side is right."&lt;ref name="africa"&gt;Filmmakers trek to Africa in search of screen adventures
Mills, Bart. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 17 June 1979: g14.&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's a movie in which there are no real bad guys or good guys," said Fargo. "Nobody really wins in the end and everybody loses, like in the real Rhodesia."&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

During filming in South Africa, Roundtree tried to purchase some alcoholic drinks but was refused service because of his skin colour.&lt;ref name="africa"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The music was composed by Tony Duhig and Jon Field, who together comprised the British group [[Jade Warrior (band)|Jade Warrior]].

==Reception==
The film was meant to have its world premiere in Johannesburg on 22 June 1979. However the film was banned by South African government censors, who deemed it a threat to state security.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt;

Though generally well-written and produced, ''Game for Vultures'' was not a massive commercial or critical success. Some critics condemned the apparent bias of the plot, which ran counter to the traditionally accepted view of Rhodesia's predominantly white government as being a racially oppressive one, while its black nationalist opponents were widely regarded as freedom fighters representing a just cause.

In addition, this film was overtaken by actual events, as the war came to an end before the film reached wide distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop ushers in new rule
The Irish Times (1921-Current File) [Dublin, Ireland] 1 June 1979: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some success in video sales, on [[VHS]] and in a [[DVD region 2|DVD Region 2]] release.

'''''Green Violinist''''' is a 1923-24 painting by artist [[Marc Chagall]] that is now in the permanent collection of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]. The work depicts a fiddler as the central figure who appears to be floating or dancing above the much smaller rooftops of the misty gray village below. This work is often considered to be the inspiration for the title of the 1964 musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.

== Background ==
''Green Violinist'' was completed following Chagall’s return to Paris after a long visit to his homeland of Russia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marc Chagall and the Jewish theater|last=|first=|publisher=New York : Guggenheim Museum|year=1992|isbn=9780892070992|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular version is a later re-working of an earlier version painted during Chagall’s second Russian period. This version was most likely completed while the 1920 original was being shown in Paris. This work presents subject matter that is nearly identical to its 1920 predecessor, ''Music'', which was one of seven paintings created on a commission from the [[Moscow State Jewish Theatre]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The direct connection between ''Green Violinist'' and its earlier counterpart was made explicitly during the artist’s lifetime at his retrospective at [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1917, during his Second Russian Period, Chagall began accepting commissions to work on theater sets and costume design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=L.L.|date=1962|title=Marc Chagall: His Lessons for the Theatre|url=|journal=Educational Theatre Journal|volume=14:3|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Chagall was commissioned to create a setting for the premier production of [[Alexis Granowsky]]’s [[Moscow State Jewish Theatre]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Susan Compton provides an excellent description of the physical layout of Chagall’s work in the theater: “When he was done, his paintings – in tempera and gouache on canvas – decorated tall the walls and even the ceiling of the theater: four vertical panels between the windows on one side, on the themes of Music, Dance, Drama, and Literature […] and a narrow frieze depicting a wedding feast […] above them; one long composition, Introduction to the Jewish Theater […], on the windowless wall opposite; a single panel, Love on the Stage […], between the two entrance doors at the back of the theater; the stage curtain; and the ceiling painting, which depicted flying lovers[.]”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the subject matter of the painting ''Introduction to the Jewish Theater'', Chagall inserts himself as an important and defining voice for the new direction of Jewish Theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is extensive evidence of the profound affect Chagall’s artistic style had on manner of acting that was adopted for the first production of the company, a collection of short plays written by Sholem Aleichem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Details ==
The style of this work reflects the avant-garde styles that were common in Paris after Chagall relocated there in 1910, but the subject matter is highly indicative of his Hasidic roots in Russia. This is made particularly evident by the central figure of the fiddler, who was a “vital presence in ceremonies and festivals” due to the Hasidic belief in achieving “communion with God through music and dance”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/802|title=Green Violinist (Violiniste)|last=Blessing|first=Jennifer|date=|website=|publisher=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specific work, a re-working of a previous painting, demonstrates a degree of nostalgia for his own work. L. L. Zimmerman writes of Chagall’s stylistic influence on the theatrical space his works occupied: “His paintings and theatrical designs, with their complete disregard for the traditional mathematics of space and time, stand out uniquely among the other products of modern artistic and theatrical endeavor.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Connection to ''Fiddler on the Roof'' ==
The connection between this painting and the Broadway musical, ''Fiddler on the Roof'', is often interpreted in very different ways by various theater companies, art historians, and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/marc-chagall-the-french-painter-who-inspired-the-title-fiddler-on-the-roof/2014/10/23/0230b382-5480-11e4-ba4b-f6333e2c0453_story.html|title=Marc Chagall: The French painter who inspired the title ‘Fiddler on the Roof’|last=Wecker|first=Menachem|date=2014-10-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical takes its source material from ''The Tevye Stories'' by Sholem Aleichem. Evidence for the connection between Chagall’s painting and the title of the musical can be found by placing the work within the context of the Russian Revolution, as it “asserts the priority of a specific ethnic culture against the hegemony of Russian society, from which the artist had been institutionally excluded since youth.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is also evidence that Chagall often showcased the people of the [[shtetl]], who are at the heart of Sholem Aleichem’s stories and, consequently ''Fiddler on the Roof'', in a very sympathetic light. In addition to the ideological similarities between Sholem Aleichem and Chagall’s works, the case for a connection between the painting and the musical is strengthened by the fact that the 1964 production of the musical was designed by Boris Aronson, who also wrote one of the earliest monographs on Chagall.

A '''guestbook''' (also '''guest book''', '''visitor log''', '''visitors' book''', '''visitors' album''') is a paper or electronic means for a visitor to acknowledge a visit to a site, physical or web-based, and leave details such as their name, postal or electronic address and any comments.  Such paper-based ledgers or books are traditional in [[church (building)|churches]], at [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;Bs]], [[museum]]s, [[school]]s, [[institution]]s and other private facilities open to the public.  Some private homes keep visitors' books.  Specialised forms of guestbooks include hotel registers, wherein guests are required to provide their contact information, and Books of Condolence, which are used at funeral homes and more generally after notable public deaths, such as the death of a monarch or president, or after a public disaster, such as an airplane crash.

Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain [[feedback]] from them. This allows the [[webmaster]] to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a [[Scripting language|script]], which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Many free guestbook hosts and scripts exist.

Names and addresses provided in guestbooks, paper-based or electronic, are frequently recorded and collated for use in providing statistics about visitors to the site, and to contact visitors to the site in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12267">{{Culture of Haiti}}

'''Haitian art''' is a complex tradition, reflecting African roots with strong Indigenous American and European aesthetic and religious influences. It is an important representation of [[Haiti]]an culture and history.

Many artists cluster in ‘schools’ of painting, such as the [[Cap-Haïtien]] school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the [[Jacmel]] School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the [[Saint-Soleil]] School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.

===Centre d’Art d'Haïti===
The [[Centre d’Art d'Haïti]], also known as "Naïve Art" or "peinture naïve", was an art movement founded in 1944 by a group of artists which include: [[Maurice Borno]], [[Andrée Malebranche]], [[Albert Mangonès]], [[Lucien Price (artist)|Lucien Price]], and [[Georges Remponeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benson|first1=LeGrace|editor1-last=Knight|editor1-first=Franklin W.|editor2-last=Gates, Jr|editor2-first=Henry Louis|title=Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro–Latin American Biography|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-199-93580-2|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199935796.001.0001/acref-9780199935796-e-1282?rskey=lIl0DJ&amp;result=10|chapter=Malebranche, Andrée (1916–2013)}} {{subscription needed|via=[http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford University Press]'s Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular artists of this movement often were influenced by [[Haitian Vodou|vaudou]] and include: [[André Pierre]], [[Hector Hippolyte]], [[Castera Bazile]], [[Wilson Bigaud]] and [[Rigaud Benoit]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802223359/http://www.discoverhaiti.com/artsynop.htm|title=A History of Haitian Art|last=|first=|date=2001|website=DiscoverHaiti.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centre d’Art d'Haïti type of artwork is often characterized by vivid colors, [[spatial composition]] and spontaneity of painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Saint Soleil School===
Saint Soleil School, also known as "Movement Saint-Soleil" was founded in 1973 as a rural arts community called Soisson-la-Montagne, in [[Pétion-Ville]], Haiti.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://okhaiti.com/saint-soleil-movement/|title=Saint Soleil Movement|last=|first=|date=2016-06-23|work=Ok Haiti|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This community was started by [[Jean-Claude Garoute]] and [[Maud Robart]] and they encouraged the academic study of painting, as well as maintaining influence by vaudou.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saint Soleil art is characterized by abstract human forms and the heavy influence of vaudou symbolism.

After Saint Soleil School disbanded, five remaining members of the school were renamed "Cinq Soleil" and include: [[Levoy Exil]], [[Prosper Pierre Louis]], [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]], [[Dieuseul Paul]], Denis Smith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A second generation member is [[Magda Magloire]], the daughter of [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]].

===Artibonite artists===
The painters of the [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] department in north-western Haiti, where [[Hôpital Albert Schweitzer Haiti|Hôpital Albert Schweitzer]] is located, have developed their own style, which is quite recognizable.

The style began with [[Saincilus Ismaël]] (1940–2000), who was influenced by Byzantine art he had seen in books. Ismaël began to paint in 1956 after visiting the [[Centre d'Art]] in [[Port-au-Prince]]. His paintings are marked by exquisite detail. Every article of clothing, house, or tree is painted with a different intricate geometric pattern.

[[Délouis Jean-Louis]] grew up in Petite Rivière under the influence of Ismaël. Although he worked under Ismaël for 15 years, he never had formal painting lessons. He began painting to make money, but gradually began to paint carefully executed scenes from his imagination.

[[Alix Dorléus]] also learned to paint with Ismaël and Mrs. Mellon. He paints all day long and will paint anywhere he feels the spirit to motivate him. His best paintings are detailed depictions, like activity maps, of daily life in the Artibonite Valley.

[[Ernst Louizor]] is considered one of the best impressionist painters of Haiti.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Louzor was born in Port-au-Prince on October 16, 1938.  After high school (Lycee Toussaint L'Ouverture '57) he worked in the tax section of Customs.  Louizor's painting career began in 1951 when at the age of 13 he joined the Centre d'Art and studied under [[Wilmino Domond]]. He later entered the Académie des Beaux-Arts shortly after its founding in 1959 and furthered his studies with [[Georges Remponeau]]. Louzor has many disciples including his wife [[Gerda Louizor]].  He has exhibited in Europe and the U.S..

=== Diaspora outside of Haiti ===
Notable artists of Haitian descent and members of the diaspora include [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Hersza Barjon]] and [[Ernst Registre]].

===The market painting===
The market painting is a Haitian archetype, originating with Laurent Casimir. It typically depicts a Haitian market and is done in the trademark colors of Casimir red, yellow and orange. The motive is often dense with people. These paintings were mass-produced by [[Laurent Casimir]] and his apprentices in the mid-1970s, all signed by Casimir.&lt;ref name="Galerie Macondo"&gt;

 {{cite web
  | title = Galerie Macondo
  | url = http://www.artshaitian.com/Pages/haitianartcasimir.html
  | accessdate = 20 April 2013 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; This archetype is later taken up by contemporary Haitian artist like [[Jean-Louis (artist)|Jean-Louis]], many of which studied under Laurent Casimir.

==Sculpture==

There is evidence that sculpture from the [[Taíno|Tainos]] in Haiti existed in the [[Pre-Columbian era]] and they would create dolls, drawings, signs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It's speculated by researchers that these sculptures may have been representing their deities (maybe the ancestors of the [[Veve|vèvè]] in [[Haitian Vodou|vaudou]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary Haitian sculpture is made of natural materials, traditional art mediums, and recycled materials.

"Haitian Steel Drum Sculpture" – The village of [[Noailles, Haiti|Noailles]] in [[Croix-des-Bouquets]] is home to over a dozen artisan workshops producing countless pieces for over two decades. The work is created out of recycled oil drums. In August 2011, the Clinton Global Initiative along with Greif Inc., donated 40 tons of scrap metal to the artists in Croix-des-Bouquets.  After the earthquake in 2010, artists had a difficult time finding material to work from.  According to Deputy Jean Tholbert Alexis, 8,000 people in the area are directly or indirectly benefit from the villages' artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton Foundation makes first loan to Haiti craft business under new program to boost economy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/clinton-foundation-makes-first-loan-to-haiti-craft-business-under-new-program/2011/08/16/gIQAtvVeJJ_story.html|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=18 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529220137/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/clinton-foundation-makes-first-loan-to-haiti-craft-business-under-new-program/2011/08/16/gIQAtvVeJJ_story.html|archivedate=29 May 2015|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Haitian flag-making===
The tradition of making flags (''drapo servis'') to decorate Vodou places of worship is a distinctive form of [[Haitian Vodou art]]. Flags most often commemorate specific spirits or saints, but the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] has become a common subject of art flags. The use of sequins in these flags became prevalent in the 1940s, and many of today's flags  cover the entire flag in colored sequins and beads. These flags are traded as art by dealers around the world.

==2010 Haiti earthquake==
On January 12, 2010 a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|devastating earthquake]] struck Port-au-Prince and the its surrounding area and resulted in mass devastation.&lt;ref name="USGS_Haiti"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Haitian [[art world]] suffered great losses in the earthquake. Museums and art galleries were extensively damaged, among them Port-au-Prince's main art museum, [[Centre d'Art]], where many art works were destroyed. The collection at [[Collège Saint Pierre]] also was devastated, as was the collection of priceless murals in the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Port-au-Prince|Holy Trinity Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=lat124&gt;{{cite news |title=A cultural agony in a nation where art is life |author=Tracy Wilkinson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=24 January 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-haiti-artists24-2010jan24,0,5707519.story |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some private art galleries were also severely damaged, including the Monnin Gallery in Pétion-Ville,&lt;ref name=lat124/&gt; and the Nader Art Gallery and Musée Nader in Port-au-Prince. The personal collection of Georges Nader Sr., the Nader collection was worth an estimated US$30-US$100 million. Shortly after the earthquake struck, [[UNESCO]] assigned special envoy Bernard Hadjadj to evaluate damage to artwork.&lt;ref name=wsj125&gt;{{cite news |title=Art Trove Is Among Nation's Losses |author=Pooja Bhatia |newspaper= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= 25 January 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703837004575013022647688144?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLENews#project%3DSLIDESHOW08%26s%3DSB10001424052748704509704575019672638040644%26articleTabs%3Darticle |accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]], led by Under Secretary [[Richard Kurin]], and with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and the Government of Haiti among others, embarked on a multiyear project and survey to help restore key Haitian cultural treasures and train local Haitians on art preservation and recovery techniques.  &lt;ref&gt;http://haiti.si.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hunt Slonem''' (born '''Hunt Slonim''', July 18, 1951) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker. He is best known for his [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-Expressionist]] paintings of tropical birds, often based on a personal aviary in which he has been keeping from 30 to over 100 live birds of various species. Slonem's works are included in many important museum collections all over the world; he is exhibiting regularly at both public and private venues, and he has received numerous honors and awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousebooks.com/site/?p=8923 Pleasure Palaces: The Art and Homes of Hunt Slonem ''[[powerHouse Books]]'' Official web site]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Hunt Slonem was born in [[Kittery, Maine]], in an [[upper middle class]] family, the eldest of four children. His father was a Navy officer, and mother – a homemaker who spent much of her time doing volunteer work. As a result of his father's military career, Slonem's family moved around as frequently as every two to three years. He lived in Hawaii, Virginia, Connecticut, California and Washington State. Slonem's grandmother was a Tennessee native who married a Minnesota-born amateur artist and educator who became the Superintendent of Public Schools in [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. It was Slonem's grandfather who always encouraged young Hunt to paint.  "I grew up around painting, and my parents dabbled in painting themselves. I was given paints as a child, and I wanted to be a painter from first grade onwards," Slonem told the online magazine ''Art Interview''. His younger brother, Jeffrey Slonim, is a prolific journalist, and contributing editor of the ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview Magazine]]'', and his cousin is the best-selling author [[Tama Janowitz]].&lt;ref name="Art Interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.art-interview.com/Issue_014/interview_Slonem_Hunt.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117074723/http://www.art-interview.com/Issue_014/interview_Slonem_Hunt.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-17|title=Hunt Slonem|date=Spring 2012|publisher=''Art Interview online Magazine''|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing school, which included living in [[Nicaragua]] as an exchange student when he was 16 years old, Slonem commenced undergraduate studies at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He then spent about six months of his sophomore year at the [[Universidad de las Américas Puebla|University of the Americas]] in [[San Andrés Cholula, Puebla]], Mexico, but later graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Painting]] and [[Art History]] from [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. He also took courses at the reputable [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in Maine, where he was exposed to such influential artists from the New York area as [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Jack Levine]], and [[Al Held]]. During that period, Slonem altered the "i" to an "e" in his family name as a nod to [[numerology]]. He moved to New York in 1973 to further his art practice, and [[Manhattan]] had become his consistent base ever since.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pmc-mag.com/2012/03/hunt-slonem/|title=HOUSES AS MUSES |work=[[Patrick McMullan|PMc Magazine]] |date=March 2012|first=Jeffrey |last=Slonim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{quote|I would say my whole life could be summed up by the word 'exotica'.|Hunt Slonem&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/hunt-slonem-acadian-dreams|title=Lincoln is Hunt Slonem's Marilyn |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] Magazine |date=December 2011|first=Clare|last=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hunt Slonem's artistic career began in New York, in the late 1970s. When he first came to Manhattan, in 1973, he was hired by the Department of Social Services to teach painting to senior citizens. He was unhappy at his job and seriously considered moving to Amsterdam when, unexpectedly, in 1975, he got a call from artist [[Janet Fish]] who offered him her studio for the summer.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt; That telephone call turned Slonem's life around. Shortly afterwards, In 1976, Hunt Slonem received a painting grant from the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and began painting in earnest. His first solo show was held at New York's Harold Reed Gallery in 1977, followed by a major exhibition at the prestigious [[Fischbach Gallery]]. As Slonem's career progressed, he was introduced to people like [[Andy Warhol]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Sylvia Miles]], and [[Truman Capote]]. Through Jeffrey Slonim, who would later serve as an usher at Andy Warhol's funeral, he also met and befriended the Belgian-born actress Monique van Vooren, the star of Warhol's film ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]]''. He soon became a habitué of New York's trendiest hot spots and an active participant in the city's burgeoning art scene.&lt;ref name="Art Interview"/&gt;

Slonem's move to New York had a profound influence on his development as an artist. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', he fell in love with "a very particular kind of New York life, one most people can only fantasize about. But people this determinedly unusual do exist here, and that is one of the city's surest charms. They feed off the city and the city feeds off them." Novelist [[Tama Janowitz]] put it succinctly, saying, "His pictures are the subtext of Manhattan, an imaginary, vivid and grotesquely evocative world that bubbles beneath the paved-over, gray city of New York which he physically inhabits -- a city where people have come from all over the world, bringing their images of other places and other lives with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/25/nyregion/about-new-york-this-artist-draws-inspiration-from-his-birds-all-72-of-them.html?scp=5&amp;sq=%22hunt+slonem%22&amp;st=nyt |title=About New York; This Artist Draws Inspiration From His Birds, All 72 of Them|work=The [[New York Times]] |date=25 December 1991 |first=Douglas|last=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite living in the heart of Manhattan,  Slonem remained true to his boyhood fascination with exotica, which he had developed as a youth in Hawaii and during his time as a foreign exchange student in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]. His paintings expressed a strong affinity for nature, especially the various species of exotic butterflies and tropical birds living on the island. He soon became well known for creating grisaille paintings of small birds in their cages.  He often painted them wet-on-wet and grit off the surfaces to denote wire enclosures after the birds had been strategically placed. Art critic [[Roberta Smith]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' that Slonem's "witty [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] strategy meshes the creatures into the picture plane and sometimes nearly obliterates them as images, but it also suspends and shrouds them in a dim, atmospheric light that is quite beautiful. If [[Joseph Cornell]] had concentrated on painting, the results might have looked like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/25/arts/review-art-condo-creates-a-future-with-layers-of-nostalgia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Review/Art |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=25 March 1988 |first=Roberta |last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds also fill the surface of his largest project yet – a 6-foot by 86 foot [[mural]] he painted for the iconic [[Bryant Park|Bryant Park Grill Restaurant]] in New York City, completed in 1995.&lt;ref name="Enc"/&gt; According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "The most notable aspect of the [restaurant's] interior is an 86-foot long mural by the artist Hunt Slonem, which depicts hundreds of birds, similar to those found in the artist's studio, where he can be found painting away with a bird or two perched on his shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1995/06/19/1995_06_19_032_TNY_CARDS_000370644 |title=Miracle on 42nd Street |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=19 June 1995 |first=Brendan |last=Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt Slonem's oil paintings pivot between the fantastic and the natural. These natural forms ultimately become the subjects for many of his artworks, appearing in large lavishly colored paintings and constructed sculptures. As an artist, he endeavors to explore the many expressive faculties of color. His paintings are layered with thick brushstrokes of vivid color, often cut into in a cross-hatched pattern that adds texture to the overall surface of the painting. Slonem often hides his subjects "behind a grid of incised lines, blurring their contours and emphasizing the paint's tactile quality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFD7153EF930A25752C1A9639C8B63&amp;scp=21&amp;sq=%22hunt+slonem%22&amp;st=nyt |title=Art Review; Landscapes: Fantastic, Elemental Or Formal |work=The [[New York Times]] |date=13 November 2005 |first=Helen A. |last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surface patterning combines with the rich colors and recognizable subject matter to create paintings that are physically and aesthetically rich. Poet and critic [[John Ashbery]] observed, "From the narrow confines of his grids, half cage, half perch, Slonem summons dazzling explosions of the variable life around us that need only to be looked at in order to spring into being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ashbery|Ashbery, John]]. "Hunt's Place", ''Didegnodiverso'', Turin, Italy, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Slonem's obsessive and repetitive rendering of his subjects reflects his desire to explore issues of spatial complexity, compression and density in what the acclaimed [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] curator [[Henry Geldzahler]] deemed "a consistent investigation of post-cubist abstraction."&lt;ref name ="Henry"&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler|Geldzahler, Henry]]. "Hunt Slonem", ''Kunst Editions/Jano Group'', New York, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The repetitive imagery also makes a reference to Andy Warhol. "I was influenced by Warhol's repetition of soup cans and Marilyn," says Slonem. "But I'm more interested in doing it in the sense of prayer, with repetition... It's really a form of worship."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; He is not interested in realism or, unlike Warhol, in advertising or media, and his paintings are neither narrative nor specific in detail. Rather, Slonem's work is deeply rooted in the act of painting. His jarring color choices, spontaneous mark making, and scratched hatch marks are the result of his ongoing fascination with the manipulation and implementation of paint. For Slonem, cross-hatching has "a feeling of a tapestry, it's like weaving. I'm making colors bleed into each other, I'm revealing the under-painting. I'm making these marks to allow the light to come through, basically. So you're seeing about five levels of paint, instead of one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.studio360.org/2012/feb/24/hunt-slonems-artist-aviary/ |title=Hunt Slonem's Artist Aviary |work=Studio360.org |date=24 February 2012|first=Kurt |last=Andersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this kind of devotion to the process of painting that prompted Henry Geldzahler to observe in 1993 that "Slonem is a painter, a painter's painter with an enormous bag of technical tricks which become apparent to the viewer the longer he stands before the work."&lt;ref name ="Henry"/&gt;

Another recurring theme of Slonem's pictorial work is portrait painting, and that of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in particular. He is interested in history and memorabilia, and for him, the "larger-than-life" Lincoln is a catchall. In Slonem's words, "On [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn [Monroe]]]'s desk, she had a picture of her mother and a picture of Lincoln. And she said, 'I really didn't know who my father was, so it might as well be Abraham Lincoln.'" According to the ''[[Interview|Interview Magazine]]'', "Slonem's portraits of Lincoln feel personal, and in surprising ways, he's close to the long-deceased." "I work with diviners and mystics, and one of them started channeling Lincoln in my house," says Slonem. "[Lincoln] guided me to paint certain things, like my doves: he wanted me to paint them as a symbol of freedom."&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

In the early 1980s, Slonem began working on a new series of so-called "Rabbit paintings."  The idea for this critically acclaimed series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2010-01-28/culture/check-out-hunt-slonem-s-rabbit-art-at-the-coral-springs-museum/|title=Check Out Hunt Slonem's Rabbit Art at the Coral Springs Museum |work=[[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]] |date=28 January 2010|first=Michael|last=Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to him after he had discovered that the year of his birth, 1951, was the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|year of the Rabbit]] in the [[Chinese zodiac|Chinese zodiac calendar]]. He often repeats imagery in this series, just like in his other series, because, he told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', the act is similar to spiritual meditation: "Mantras are holy because you repeat them." This theme continued to inspire Slonem over the years, and the series is as prominent in his work today as it was over thirty years ago.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

Apart from painting, Slonem is also making sculptures, like the sizable, "Tocos," an 18-foot acrylic and aluminum tower of toucans exhibited at the [[Polk Museum of Art]] in 2012. He has also restored several historic houses. "I consider it part of my art form,"  Slonem said in an interview with ''NewsChief.com''.  His "art form" also includes [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] furniture - in his homes, studios, and exhibits. In 2009, [[Bergdorf Goodman]], a luxury department store in New York City, recreated Slonem's distinct art-filled living room for its windows display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/bergdorf-goodman-x-hunt-slonem/25365 |title=Bergdorf Goodman x Hunt Slonem |work=Herald de Paris |date=26 February 2009|first=Julia|last=Chesky}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Slonem's view, "Art incorporated with furniture becomes a work of art itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newschief.com/article/20120119/NEWSCHIEF/201195025?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar |title=Hunt Slonem exhibit on display at Polk Museum of Art through March |work=NewsChief.com |date=16 January 2012|first=Donna|last=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, German automaker [[Audi]] enlisted Hunt Slonem to create an exclusive design for its sleek new [[Audi A5|A5 coupe]], and he created a one-of-a-kind design based on one of his oil painting for the car's exterior. "It's an earlier work of mine with birds flying through the sky; the original work is in the collection of the [[Colby College Museum of Art|Colby Museum]] in Maine, where I was born," said Slonem of the piece, which is painted in blues, blacks, reds, and whites with cockatoos. The mobile artwork was unveiled in conjunction with the [[New York International Auto Show]] at the Audi Forum in Manhattan. The "Hunt Slonem Audi A5," as it was dubbed, then toured Audi dealerships throughout the United States, before returning to New York where it was auctioned off to benefit a cancer research charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/the-fix/article/21145 |title=Hunt Slonem's Creative Car|date=14 February 2008 |publisher=''[[Daily Front Row]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Albert Maysles]], the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary filmmaker ([[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]], [[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]], [[Grey Gardens]]), announced that he will be shooting a feature-length [[documentary]] on Hunt Slonem's life and his art.&lt;ref name="NYM"/&gt;

In 2014, he collaborated with fashion accessories company [[Echo Design Group]] for a limited edition scarf and handbag collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msfabulous.com/2014/08/echo-design-hunt-slonem-collaboration.html |title=Echo Design &amp; Hunt Slonem Collaboration|date=8 August 2014 |publisher=''[[Ms. Fabulous]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum exhibitions and collections==

==Personal life==

Hunt Slonem has never been married and has no children. Until 2010, he occupied a Tenth Street studio in Manhattan that was 40,000 square feet, divided into 89 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1S9SxfyPmE |title=Hunt Slonem |work=Men.Style.com |date=7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Slonem moved to a 15,000 square foot fourth floor former headquarters of the film company Moviola, on West 45th Street. The space served as his painting studio and was divided into a number of small rooms, all of which Slonem painted in old Louisiana plantation-house colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hunt-slonems-studio/|title=Hunt Slonem's Studio |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] Magazine|date=24 February 2012|first=Hunt |last=Slonem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio housed his ever-expanding quirky collections, from [[Neo-Gothic]] chairs to top hats, to marble busts of [[Marie Antoinette]], to various [[Objet d'art|''objets d'art'']], mined from flea markets and antique fairs. In an interview in Vincent Katz's book ''Pleasure Palaces: The Art &amp; Homes of Hunt Slonem,'' he describes his collecting technique as "cluttering."&lt;ref name ="Katz"&gt;Katz, Vincent. ''Pleasure Palaces: The Art &amp; Homes of Hunt Slonem,'' ''[[powerHouse Books]]'', New York, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  For him, objects are "friends;" the more there are, the more he is inspired. "I have to have a certain amount of stuff in place before I can function and paint," he says.&lt;ref name="NYM"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/homedesign/greatrooms/64276/|title=Living With a Thousand Best Friends|work= [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=28 February 2010 |first=Wendy|last=Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Slonem still lives in the loft apartment he moved into in 1973, according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', he does nearly all his entertaining at his new 25,000 square foot West 34th Street studio in the industrial [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of Manhattan where he moved in 2011. He christened the third floor loft space with a birthday party attended by more than 200 people.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204190504577040280261991196|title=An Oddball Menagerie|work= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 November 2011 |first=Kelly|last=Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt Slonem also owns two historically important Louisiana plantations—one called [[Albania Plantation House|Albania Plantation]], on the [[Bayou Teche]] in [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]], about two hours' drive northwest of [[New Orleans]], and the other – the Lakeside Plantation, in a remote location near the town of Batchelor, one hour north of [[Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref name ="Katz"/&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', the Batchelor property includes "an 1832 plantation house called Lakeside, pink if you please, as surprising in this community of shoebox houses as an aged diva in a pink organdy dress at McDonald's. Also as indifferent, inasmuch as a house can be indifferent, to the bruising of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31hunt.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=Southern Gothic: Ghosts Welcome|work=The [[New York Times]] |date=31 May 2007 |first=Joyce|last=Wadler}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once owned by [[Marquis de La Fayette]] whose close relationship with lifelong friends such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Monroe]], [[John Adams]], and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]] played a pivotal role in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  In a show of gratitude, the United States gave La Fayette land which is known today as Lakeside Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acadianmuseum.com/marquis.html Acadian Museum Exhibit: 2007 Marquis de La Fayette Commemoration: “The Overlooked Legacy of La Fayette: The Louisiana Purchase” [[Erath, Louisiana|Acadian Museum]] Official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; The property is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Louisiana]].

== Plot ==
Mia Hall and her family are getting ready to go on with their normal day activities when it is announced on the radio that school has been canceled. Mia's dad Denny is a teacher and as a result of the snow day does not have to go to work. Mia's mom Kat, a travel agent, decides to call in sick and along with her family get on the road to visit Mia's grandparents who live on a farm. It is also revealed that Mia is dating an older, popular up-and-coming rockstar named Adam Wilde.

The story flashes back to Mia's early life with a rocker dad and an inexperienced mom, when one day they take Mia to a music class where Mia decides that she wants to start playing the cello. After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.

Years later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam peeks in on her playing, seeing her for the first time, leading him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her. Adam then asks Mia out on a date to a cello recital, where they show mutual affection towards one another.

The story flashes back to current time with the family driving to the grandparents' farm when their car collides with an oncoming truck. Mia appears to have an [[out-of-body experience]] where she finds herself barefoot and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery. A sympathetic nurse, Nurse Ramirez, tells Mia—her physical body, not Mia's spirit, which apparently she cannot see either—that it is up to her whether or not she wants to stay.

The story flashes back once again to Mia attending one of Adam's concerts with his band Willamette Stone, where she does not seem to fit in. Adam's band is steadily gaining more recognition and gets signed to a label, which starts to put a strain on their relationship due to the travel schedule. While at dinner, Mia's grandpa suggests that she should apply to [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]], an idea which she initially rebuffs, but later further researches. She eventually lands an audition in [[San Francisco]]. It takes a while for Mia to tell Adam about her audition and when she does he becomes upset and leaves for a week-long gig.

In the present day, Mia undergoes surgery. She sees a doctor speaking with her grandparents who are standing outside of a pediatric room where Teddy lies in a coma-like state. Adam comes to the hospital to see Mia, but is not allowed in as he is not an immediate family member. It is then revealed that Mia's mom Kat was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] and her dad Denny died on the operating table. She later finds out that Teddy has died from an [[epidural hematoma]]. Grandpa talks to Mia, revealing that her father gave up being in a band because he wanted to give her a better life and be a better father. He also, tearfully, gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.

The story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted, she would go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.

After some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his [[iPod]] for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted and lets her know that he would do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, squeezes Adam's hand and opens her eyes and sees Adam as he hovers over her and says, "Mia?".

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
As of November 20, 2014, ''If I Stay'' has grossed a worldwide total of $78,396,071 against a budget of $11 million.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=If I Stay (2014) - Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ifistay.htm|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''If I Stay'' opened at #3 to 2,907 locations in North America behind ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', which were in their fourth and third weeks respectively. On its opening day the film earned $6,827,007 earning it the top spot for the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If I Stay (2014) - Daily Box Office Results|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&amp;id=ifistay.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 35%, based on 122 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, "Although Chloë Grace Moretz gives it her all and the story adds an intriguing supernatural twist to its melodramatic [[young adult fiction]] framework, ''If I Stay'' is ultimately more manipulative than moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_i_stay/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: If I Stay|date=August 22, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 46 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/if-i-stay|title=Metacritic: If I Stay|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott praised Moretz's acting.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;A.O. Scott, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/movies/if-i-stay-weighs-teenagers-prospects-after-horrific-crash.html?_r=0 In Limbo, and in Love], ''The New York Times'', August 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the "music is both the best and the corniest part of ''If I Stay'', which makes excellent use of the classical cello repertoire."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Justin Chang criticized Moretz's acting, explaining that "she comes off as a bit too self-assured to play the nerdy misfit."&lt;ref name="variety review"&gt;Justin Chang, [https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-if-i-stay-1201283269/ Film Review: ‘If I Stay’], ''Variety'', August 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Lane of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote a critical review of the movie, saying, "The saddest thing about 'If I Stay' is that it affords Moretz so little opportunity to be non-sad." In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Olivier Gettell summed up that critics saw the film was "clunky and uninspired."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Oliver Gettell, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-if-i-stay-chloe-grace-moretz-movie-reviews-critics-20140821-story.html], ''The Los Angeles Times'', August 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Color perception.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The human eye's red-to-green and blue-to-yellow values of each one-wavelength visible color]]

[[Image:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Normalized [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of the three kinds of [[cone cell]]s, which define the space of human color [[sensation and perception|sensation]]]]
'''Impossible colors''' or '''forbidden colors''' are supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.

==Types==
These impossible colors are of two types:
#Colors that would be seen if the output strengths of the human eye [[retina]]'s three types of [[cone cell]] (red, green, blue) could be set to values which cannot be produced by exposing the eye in normal seeing conditions to any possible combination of strengths of the frequencies of visible light.
#Colors that cannot be seen directly from any combination of retina signal output from one place in one eye, but can be generated in the brain's [[visual cortex]] by mixing color signals from the two eyes, or from more than one part of the same eye. Examples of these colors are yellowish-blue and reddish-green.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983/&gt; Those colors that appear to be similar to, for example, both red and green, or to both yellow and blue. (This does not mean the result of mixing paints of those two colors in painting, or the result of mixing lights of those two colors on a screen.)

==Opponent process==
{{Main|Opponent process}}
The color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of [[cone cell]]s have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:
* Red versus green.
* Blue versus yellow
* Black versus white (this is achromatic and detects light-dark variation, or luminance).
Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color, and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both, for each opponent pair.

==Real colors==
{{multiple image |align= right |direction= horizontal |total_width= 440 |caption_align= left |image1= CIExy1931.png |width1= 542 |height1= 599 |caption1= The [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] color space [[chromaticity]] diagram. The white regions outside the black line correspond to imaginary colors. (Note that the colors in this figure do not reproduce the actual colors in the diagram, due to the [[sRGB color space|limitations of RGB computer displays]]) |image2= CIExy1931 ProPhoto.svg | width2= 476 |height2= 540 |caption2= The [[ProPhoto RGB color space]] uses imaginary green and blue primaries to obtain a larger gamut (space inside the triangle) than would be possible with three real primaries. However, some real colors are still irreproducible.}}
Real colors are colors that can be produced by a physical light source. Any [[additive color|additive mixture]] of two real colors is also a real color. When colors are displayed in the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]], additive mixture results in a color along the line between the colors being mixed. By mixing any three colors, one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe — this is called the [[gamut]] formed by those three colors, which are called [[primary color]]s. Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries.

When defining primaries, the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible. Since the region of real colors is not a triangle (see illustration), it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region. The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors, but since the region of real colors is not a polygon, there always will be some colors at the edge left out. Therefore, one selects colors outside of the region of real colors as primary colors; in other words, imaginary primary colors. Mathematically, the gamut created in this way contains so-called "imaginary colors".

In computer and television screen color displays, the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available [[phosphor]]s chosen to be as near as possible to pure red and pure green and pure blue, and thus are within the area of real colors; note that these color space diagrams inevitably display, instead of real colors outside your computer screen's gamut triangle, the nearest color which is inside the gamut triangle. See page [[Gamut]] for more information about the color range available on display devices.

==Imaginary colors==
One type of ''imaginary color'' (also referred to as ''non-physical'' or ''unrealizable color'') is a point in a [[color space]] that corresponds to combinations of [[cone cell]] responses in one eye, that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html |title=Light and the eye|accessdate=May 5, 2007 |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |year=2005 |work=Handprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, no object can have an imaginary color. But such imaginary colors are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining [[color space]]s.

The [[spectral sensitivity]] curve of medium-wavelength ("M") cone cells overlaps those of short-wavelength ("S") and long-wavelength ("L") cone cells. Light of any [[wavelength]] that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, no wavelength (except perhaps a bit of the far red), and no non-negative [[spectral power distribution]], excites only one sort of cone. If, for example, M cones could be excited alone, this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green; producing it by seeing light would need some of the red and blue parts of visible light to have negative power, which is impossible. Such a "hyper-green" color would be in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram (left image to the right) in the blank area above the colored area and between the ''y''-axis and the line ''x''+''y''=1.

==Chimerical colors==
[[File:chimerical-color-demo.svg|thumb|By staring at a "fatigue template" for 20-60 seconds, then switching to a neutral target, it is possible to view "impossible" colors.]]
A ''chimerical color'' is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color for a while until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. They are explained by the [[opponent process]] color theory.&lt;ref name=Churchland_2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimerical Colors: Some Phenomenological Predictions from Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2005|last1=Churchland|first1=Paul|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=527–560|doi=10.1080/09515080500264115}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an [[afterimage]] of the [[complementary colors]]. Exploration of the color space outside the range of "real colors" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g. "yellowish blue").&lt;ref name="Churchland_2005"/&gt; Chimerical colors include:
* Stygian colors: these are simultaneously dark and impossibly saturated. For example, to see "stygian blue": staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue [[afterimage]], then on looking at black, the blue is seen as blue against the black, but due to lack of the usual brightness contrast it seems to be as dark as the black. 
* Self-luminous colors: these mimic the effect of a glowing material, even when viewed on a medium such as paper, which can only reflect and not emit its own light. For example, to see "self-luminous red": staring at green causes a red afterimage, then on looking at white, the red is seen against the white and may seem to be brighter than the white.
* Hyperbolic colors: these are impossibly highly saturated. For example, to see "hyperbolic orange": staring at bright cyan causes an orange afterimage, then on looking at orange, the resulting orange afterimage seen against the orange background may cause an orange color purer than the purest orange color that can be made by any normally-seen light. Or, staring at something pure magenta in bright sunlight for two minutes or more, thus temporarily making the red and blue cones less sensitive, and then looking at green leaves, may result in briefly seeing an unnaturally pure green afterimage.

==Claimed evidence for ability to see colors not in the color space==

[[File:Impossible Colors, Blue and Yellow.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Yellow–Blue" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

[[File:Impossible Colors, Red and Green.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Red–Green" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

Under normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking "redgreen" or "yellowblue".

In 1983, [[Hewitt D. Crane]] and Thomas P. Piantanida performed tests using an [[Eye tracking|eye-tracker]] device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device could track involuntary movements of one eye (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye's retina; the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. Under such conditions, the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to edge-detecting [[neuron]]s becoming fatigued) and the colors flowed into each other in the brain's [[visual cortex]], overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new colors entirely, which are not in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], either in its real part or in its imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an even field of the new color; some saw a regular pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color. Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterwards, they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.221.4615.1078 |jstor=1691544 |title=On Seeing Reddish Green and Yellowish Blue |year=1983 |last1=Crane |first1=Hewitt D. |last2=Piantanida |first2=Thomas P. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4615 |pages=1078–80 |pmid=17736657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color (that is, the field was not achromatic), they were unable to name or describe the color. One of these observers was an artist with a large color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suarez J|
title=Reddish Green: A Challenge for Modal Claims About Phenomenal Structure|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00247.x | year=2009 | last2=Suarez | first2=Juan | volume=78 | issue=2 | pages=346–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001 Vincent A. Billock and Gerald A. Gleason and Brian H. Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the 1983 experiment did not control for variations in the perceived [[luminance]] of the colors from subject to subject: two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering. The 2001 experiment was similar but controlled for luminance.&lt;ref name="josaa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billock|first=Vincent A.|author2=Gerald A. Gleason |author3=Brian H. Tsou |year=2001|url=http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/BillockEtAlImpossibleColorsJOSA2001.pdf|title=Perception of forbidden colors in retinally stabilized equiluminant images: an indication of softwired cortical color opponency?|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|publisher=Optical Society of America|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2398–2403|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.18.002398|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had these observations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some subjects (4 out of 7) described transparency phenomena—as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen, one through the other. ...

We found that when colors were equiluminant, subjects saw reddish greens, bluish yellows, or a multistable spatial color exchange (an entirely novel perceptual phenomena {{sic}}); when the colors were nonequiluminant, subjects saw spurious pattern formation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This led them to propose a "soft-wired model of cortical color opponency", in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the "losing" neurons go completely silent. In this model, eliminating competition by, for instance, inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together.&lt;ref name="josaa"/&gt;

Hsieh and Tse in 2006 disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are, in reality, intermediate colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.030 |title=Illusory color mixing upon perceptual fading and filling-in does not result in "forbidden colors" |year=2006 |last1=Hsieh |first1=P.-J. |last2=Tse |first2=P.

Since ancient times, [[Greeks]], [[Etruscans]] and [[Celts]] have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian peninsula respectively. The very numerous [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica]] go back to 8,000 BC, and there are rich remains of [[Etruscan art]] from thousands of tombs, as well as rich remains from the Greek colonies at [[Paestum]], [[Valle dei Templi|Agrigento]] and elsewhere. [[Ancient Rome]] finally emerged as the dominant Italian and European power. The Roman remains in Italy are of extraordinary richness, from the grand Imperial monuments of [[Rome]] itself to the survival of exceptionally preserved ordinary buildings in [[Pompeii]] and neighbouring sites. Following the [[fall of the Roman Empire]], in the [[Middle Ages]] Italy, especially the north, remained an important centre, not only of the [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, but for the [[Byzantine art]] of [[Ravenna#Main_sights|Ravenna]] and other sites.

Italy was the main centre of artistic developments throughout the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] (1300-1600), beginning with the [[Proto-Renaissance]] of [[Giotto]] and reaching a particular peak in the [[High Renaissance]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]], whose works inspired the later phase of the Renaissance, known as [[Mannerism]]. Italy retained its artistic dominance into the 17th century with the [[Baroque]] (1600-1750). [[Grand Tour|Cultural tourism]] and [[Neoclassicism]] (1750-1850) became a major prop to an otherwise faltering economy. Both Baroque and Neoclassicism originated in Rome&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; and were the last Italian-born styles that spread to all [[Western art]]. However, Italy maintained a presence in the international art scene from the mid-19th century onwards, with movements such as the [[Macchiaioli]], [[Futurism]], [[Metaphysical art|Metaphysical]], [[Novecento Italiano]], [[Spatialism]], [[Arte Povera]], and [[Transavantgarde]].
 
Italian art has influenced several major movements throughout the centuries and has produced several great artists, including painters, architects and sculptors. Today, Italy has an important place in the international art scene, with several major art galleries, museums and exhibitions; major artistic centres in the country include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Turin, Genoa, Naples, Palermo, Lecce and other cities. Italy is [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|home to 53]] [[World Heritage Sites]], the largest number of any country in the world.

== Etruscan art ==

{{Main|Etruscan art}}

Etruscan bronze figures and a terracotta funerary reliefs include examples of a vigorous Central Italian tradition which had waned by the time Rome began building her empire on the peninsula.

The Etruscan paintings that have survived to modern times are mostly wall frescoes from graves, and mainly from [[Tarquinia]]. These are the most important example of pre-Roman figurative art in Italy known to scholars.

The frescoes consist of painting on top of fresh plaster, so that when the plaster is dried the painting becomes part of the plaster and an integral part of the wall, which helps it survive so well (indeed, almost all of surviving Etruscan and Roman painting is in fresco). Colours were made from stones and minerals in different colours that ground up and mixed in a medium, and fine brushes were made of animal hair (even the best brushes are produced with ox hair). From the mid 4th century BC [[chiaroscuro]] began to be used to portray depth and volume. Sometimes scenes of everyday life are portrayed, but more often traditional mythological scenes. The concept of proportion does not appear in any surviving frescoes and we frequently find portrayals of animals or men with some body-parts out of proportion. One of the best-known Etruscan frescoes is that of Tomb of the Lioness at Tarquinia.

== Roman art ==

{{Main|Roman art}}
[[File:Campus Martius.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Rome under the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].]]

The Etruscan were responsible for constructing Rome's earliest monumental buildings. Roman temples and houses were closely based on Etruscan models. Elements of Etruscan influence in Roman temples included the podium and the emphasis on the front at the expense of the remaining three sides. Large Etruscan houses were grouped around a central hall in much the same way as Roman town Large houses were later built around an ''[[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]''. The influence of Etruscan architecture gradually declined during the republic in the face of influences (particularly [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]]) from elsewhere. Etruscan architecture was itself influenced by the Greeks, so that when the Romans adopted Greek styles, it was not a totally alien culture. During the republic there was probably a steady absorption of architectural influences, mainly from the Hellenistic world, but after the fall of Syracuse in 211 BC, Greek works of art flooded into Rome. During the 2nd century BC, the flow of these works, and more important, Greek craftsmen, continued, thus decisively influencing the development of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]]. By the end of the republic, when [[Vitruvius]] wrote his treatise on architecture, Greek architectural theory and example were dominant. With the expansion of the empire, Roman architecture spread over a wide area, used for both public buildings and some larger private ones. In many areas elements of style were influenced by local tastes, particularly decoration, but the architecture remained recognizably Roman. Styles of vernacular architecture were influenced to varying degrees by Roman architecture, and in many regions Roman and native elements are found combined in the same building.

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The statue known as the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]].]] 

By the 1st century AD, [[Rome]] had become the biggest and most advanced city in the world. The ancient Romans came up with new technologies to improve the city's sanitation systems, roads, and buildings. They developed a system of aqueducts that piped freshwater into the city, and they built sewers that removed the city's waste. The wealthiest Romans lived in large houses with gardens. Most of the population, however, lived in apartment buildings made of stone, concrete, or limestone. The Romans developed new techniques and used materials such as volcanic soil from Pozzuoli, a village near Naples, to make their cement harder and stronger. This concrete allowed them to build large apartment buildings called [[Insula (building)|''insulae'']].

Wallpaintings decorated the houses of the wealthy. Paintings often showed garden landscapes, events from Greek and Roman mythology, historical scenes, or scenes of everyday life. Romans decorated floors with mosaics — pictures or designs created with small colored tiles. The richly colored paintings and mosaics helped to make rooms in Roman houses seem larger and brighter and showed off the wealth of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Alex T. Nice, Ph.D., former Visiting Associate Professor of Classics, Classical Studies Program, Willamette University.&lt;br&gt; Nice, Alex T. "Rome, Ancient." ''World Book Advanced.'' World Book, 2011. Web. 30 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Christian era of the late Empire, from 350–500 AD, wall painting, mosaic ceiling and floor work, and funerary sculpture thrived, while full-sized sculpture in the round and panel painting died out, most likely for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="Piper, p. 261"&gt;Piper, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium (renamed [[Constantinople]]), Roman art incorporated Eastern influences to produce the Byzantine style of the late empire. When Rome was sacked in the 5th century, artisans moved to and found work in the Eastern capital. The Church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople employed nearly 10,000 workmen and artisans, in a final burst of Roman art under Emperor [[Justinian I]], who also ordered the creation of the famous mosaics of [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Piper, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval art ==

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Italian art consisted primarily of architectural decorations (frescoes and mosaics). Byzantine art in Italy was a highly formal and refined decoration with a standardized calligraphy and an admirable use of color and gold. Until the 13th century, art in Italy was almost entirely regional, affected by external European and Eastern currents. After ''c.'' 1250 the art of the various regions developed characteristics in common, so that a certain unity as well as great originality is observable.

=== Byzantine art ===

{{Main|Byzantine art}}

With the fall of its western capital, the Roman Empire continued for another 1000 years under the leadership of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/byzantium/index.html] Byzantium. ''Fordham University.'' Web. 06 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine artisans were used in important projects throughout Italy, and Byzantine styles of painting can be found up to the 14th century.

=== Gothic art ===

{{Main|Gothic art}}

The Gothic period marks a transition from the medieval to the Renaissance and is characterised by the styles and attitudes nurtured by the influence of the Dominican and Franciscan order of monks, founded by [[Saint Dominic]] and Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] respectively.

It was a time of religious disputes within the church. The Franciscans and Dominicans were founded as an attempt to address these disputes and bring the [[Catholic Church]] back to basics. The early days of the Franciscans are remembered especially for the compassion of Saint Francis, while the Dominicans are remembered as the order most responsible for the beginnings of the [[Inquisition]].

[[Gothic architecture]] began in northern Europe and spread southward to Italy.

== Renaissance art ==

{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}

During the Middle Ages, painters and sculptors tried to give their works a spiritual quality. They wanted viewers to concentrate on the deep religious meaning of their paintings and sculptures. But Renaissance painters and sculptors, like Renaissance writers, wanted to portray people and nature realistically. Medieval architects designed huge cathedrals to emphasize the grandeur of God and to humble the human spirit. Renaissance architects designed buildings whose proportions were based on those of the human body and whose ornamentation imitated ancient designs.

=== Arts of the 14th century and early 15th century ===

During the early 14th century, the Florentine painter [[Giotto]] became the first artist to portray nature realistically since the fall of the Roman Empire. He produced magnificent frescoes (paintings on damp plaster) for churches in Assisi, Florence, Padua, and Rome. Giotto attempted to create lifelike figures showing real emotions. He portrayed many of his figures in realistic settings.

A remarkable group of Florentine architects, painters, and sculptors worked during the early 15th century. They included the painter [[Masaccio]], the sculptor [[Donatello]], and the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].

Masaccio's finest work was a series of frescoes he painted about 1427 in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. The frescoes realistically show Biblical scenes of emotional intensity. In these paintings, Masaccio utilized Brunelleschi's system for achieving linear perspective.

In his sculptures, Donatello tried to portray the dignity of the human body in realistic and often dramatic detail. His masterpieces include three statues of the Biblical hero David. In a version finished in the 1430s, Donatello portrayed David as a graceful, nude youth, moments after he slew the giant Goliath. The work, which is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, was the first large free-standing nude created in Western art since classical antiquity.

Brunelleschi was the first Renaissance architect to revive the ancient Roman style of architecture. He used arches, columns, and other elements of classical architecture in his designs. One of his best-known buildings is the beautifully and harmoniously proportioned [[Pazzi Chapel]] in Florence. The chapel, begun in 1442 and completed about 1465, was one of the first buildings designed in the new Renaissance style. Brunelleschi also was the first Renaissance artist to master ''linear perspective'', a mathematical system with which painters could show space and depth on a flat surface.

=== Arts of the late 15th century and early 16th century ===

Arts of the late 15th century and early 16th century were dominated by three men. They were [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Michelangelo excelled as a painter, architect, and poet. In addition, he has been called the greatest sculptor in history.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, John Wyndham. [https://books.google.com/books?id=beFOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q= ''Italian High Renaissance and Baroque sculpture.''] Phaidon Press, 1996. p. 13. Web. 5 Oct. 2011.&lt;br&gt;"''Michelangelo was the first artist in history to be recognized by his contemporaries as a genius in our modern sense. Canonized before his death, he has remained magnificent, formidable and remote. Some of the impediments to establishing close contact with his mind are inherent in his own uncompromising character; he was the greatest sculptor who ever lived, and the greatest sculptor is not necessarily the most approachable.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo was a master of portraying the human figure. For example, his famous statue of the Israelite leader ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]'' (1516) gives an overwhelming impression of physical and spiritual power. These qualities also appear in the frescoes of Biblical and classical subjects that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Vatican's [[Sistine Chapel]]. The frescoes, painted from 1508 to 1512, rank among the greatest works of Renaissance art.

Raphael's paintings are softer in outline and more poetic than those of Michelangelo. Raphael was skilled in creating perspective and in the delicate use of color. He painted a number of beautiful pictures of the Madonna (Virgin Mary) and many outstanding portraits. One of his greatest works is the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]''. The painting was influenced by classical Greek and Roman models. It portrays the great philosophers and scientists of ancient Greece in a setting of classical arches. Raphael was thus making a connection between the culture of classical antiquity and the Italian culture of his time.

[[File:Michelangelos David.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' by Michelangelo, 1501-1504]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] painted two of the most famous works of Renaissance art, the wallpainting ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' and the portrait ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. Leonardo had one of the most searching minds in all history. He wanted to know how everything that he saw in nature worked. In over 4,000 pages of notebooks, he drew detailed diagrams and wrote his observations. Leonardo made careful drawings of human skeletons and muscles, trying to learn how the body worked. Due to his inquiring mind, Leonardo has become a symbol of the Renaissance spirit of learning and intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;James Hankins, Ph.D., Professor of History, Harvard University.&lt;br&gt; Hankins, James. "Renaissance." ''World Book Advanced.'' World Book, 2011. Web. 1 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of [[High Renaissance]] architecture was [[Donato Bramante]], who came to Rome in 1499, when he was 55. His first Roman masterpiece, the ''[[Tempietto]]'' (1502) at San Pietro in Montorio, is a centralized dome structure that recalls Classical temple architecture. [[Pope Julius II]] chose Bramante to be papal architect, and together they devised a plan to replace the 4th-century Old St. Peter's with a new church of gigantic dimensions. The project was not completed, however, until long after Bramante's death.

Humanistic studies continued under the powerful popes of the High Renaissance, Julius II and [[Leo X]], as did the development of polyphonic music. The [[Sistine Choir]], which p\d, drew musicians and singers from all of Italy and northern Europe. Among the most famous composers who became members were [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]].

=== Mannerism ===

{{Main|Mannerism}}

Mannerism was an elegant, courtly style. It flourished in Florence, Italy, where its leading representatives were [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Bronzino]]. The style was introduced to the French court by [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and by [[Francesco Primaticcio]]. The Venetian painter [[Tintoretto]] was influenced by the style.

The mannerist approach to painting also influenced other arts.

In architecture, the work of Italian architect [[Giulio Romano]] is a notable example. The Italian [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and Flemish born [[Giambologna]] were the style's chief representatives in sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Zafran, Ph.D., Curator, Department of European Paintings and Sculpture, Wadsworth Atheneum.&lt;br&gt; Zafran, Eric M. "Mannerism." ''World Book Advanced.'' World Book, 2011. Web. 1 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians regard this period as a degeneration of High Renaissance classicism or even as an interlude between High Renaissance and baroque, in which case the dates are usually from ''c.'' 1520 to 1600, and it is considered a positive style complete in itself.

== Baroque and Rococo Art ==

[[File:The Calling of Saint Matthew-Caravaggo (1599-1600).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[The Calling of St Matthew (Caravaggio)|Caravaggio's ''The Calling of St. Matthew]]'', 1599-1600]]

{{Main|Italian Baroque art|Italian Rococo art}}

In the early 17th century Rome became the center of a renewal of Italian dominance in the arts. In Parma, [[Antonio da Correggio]] decorated church vaults with lively figures floating softly on clouds — a scheme that was to have a profound influence on baroque ceiling paintings. The stormy chiaroscuro paintings of [[Caravaggio]] and the robust, illusionistic paintings of the Bolognese Carracci family gave rise to the baroque period in Italian art. [[Domenichino]], [[Francesco Albani]], and later [[Andrea Sacchi]] were among those who carried out the classical implications in the art of the Carracci.

On the other hand, [[Guido Reni]], [[Guercino]], [[Orazio Gentileschi]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], and later [[Pietro da Cortona]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]], while thoroughly trained in a classical-allegorical mode, were at first inclined to paint dynamic compositions full of gesticulating figures in a manner closer to that of Caravaggio. The towering virtuoso of baroque exuberance and grandeur in sculpture and architecture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]. Toward 1640 many of the painters leaned toward the classical style that had been brought to the fore in Rome by the French expatriate [[Nicolas Poussin]]. The sculptors [[Alessandro Algardi]] and [[François Duquesnoy]] also tended toward the classical. Notable late baroque artists include the Genoese [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] and the Neapolitans [[Luca Giordano]] and [[Francesco Solimena]].

The leading lights of the 18th century came from Venice. Among them were the brilliant exponent of the rococo style, [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]; the architectural painters [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Canaletto]], [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], and [[Bernardo Bellotto]]; and the engraver of Roman antiquities, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]].

== Italian Neoclassical and 19th-century art ==
[[File:Francesco Hayez 008.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Hayez]]'s [[The Kiss (Hayez)|''The Kiss'']] (1859) has come to represent the spirit of the Italian [[Risorgimento]]]]
{{Main|Italian Neoclassical and 19th century art}}

As in other parts of Europe, Italian Neoclassical art was mainly based on the principles of [[Roman art|Ancient Roman]] and [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] art and architecture, but also by the Italian [[Renaissance architecture]] and its basics, such as in the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"]].

Classicism and Neoclassicism in Italian art and architecture developed during the [[Italian Renaissance]], notably in the writings and designs of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. It places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of [[Roman Architecture|Ancient Rome]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and later to the rest of continental Europe.

The sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] was a leading exponent of the neoclassic style. Internationally famous, he was regarded as the most brilliant sculptor in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, Robert; Janson, Horst Woldemar. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BnxPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= ''19th century art.''] Abrams, 1984. p. 104. Web. 5 Oct. 2011.&lt;br&gt;"''Antonio Canova (1757–1822) was not only the greatest sculptor of his generation; he was the most famous artist of the Western world from the 1790s until long after his death.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Macchiaioli ===

{{Main|Macchiaioli}}

Italy produced its own form of [[Impressionism]], the [[Macchiaioli]] artists, who were actually there first, before the more famous Impressionists: [[Giovanni Fattori]], [[Silvestro Lega]], [[Telemaco Signorini]], [[Giuseppe Abbati]]. The Macchiaioli artists were forerunners to Impressionism in France. They believed that areas of light and shadow, or ''macchie'' (literally patches or spots) were the chief components of a work of art. The word macchia was commonly used by Italian artists and critics in the 19th century to describe the sparkling quality of a drawing or painting, whether due to a sketchy and spontaneous execution or to the harmonious breadth of its overall effect.

A hostile review published on November 3, 1862 in the journal ''[[Gazzetta del Popolo]]'' marks the first appearance in print of the term Macchiaioli.&lt;ref name=Broude96&gt;Broude, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The term carried several connotations: it mockingly in the booty finished works were no more than sketches, and recalled the phrase "darsi alla macchia", meaning, idiomatically, to hide in the bushes or scrubland. The artists did, in fact, paint much of their work in these wild areas. This sense of the name also identified the artists with outlaws, reflecting the traditionalists' view that new school of artists was working outside the rules of art, according to the strict laws defining artistic expression at the time.

== Italian modern and contemporary art ==

Early in the 20th century the exponents of futurism developed a dynamic vision of the modern world while [[Giorgio de Chirico]] expressed a strange metaphysical quietude and [[Amedeo Modigliani]] joined the school of Paris. Gifted later modern artists include the sculptors [[Giacomo Manzù]], [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]], the still-life painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], and the iconoclastic painter [[Lucio Fontana]]. In the second half of the 20th century, Italian designers, particularly those of Milan, have profoundly influenced international styles with their imaginative and ingenious functional works.

=== Futurism ===

{{Main|Futurism}}

[[File:Umberto Boccioni, 1911, The Street Enters the House, oil on canvas, 100 x 100.6 cm, Sprengel Museum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' by Umberto Boccioni.]]

Futurism was an Italian art movement that flourished from 1909 to about 1916. It was the first of many art movements that tried to break with the past in all areas of life. Futurism glorified the power, speed, and excitement that characterized the machine age. From the French Cubist painters and multiple-exposure photography, the Futurists learned to break up realistic forms into multiple images and overlapping fragments of color. By such means, they attempted to portray the energy and speed of modern life. In literature, Futurism demanded the abolition of traditional sentence structures and verse forms.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas K. S. Hyland, Ph.D., Director, San Antonio Museum of Art.&lt;br&gt; Hyland, Douglas K. S. "Futurism." ''World Book Advanced.'' World Book, 2011. Web. 4 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurism was first announced on Feb. 20, 1909, when the Paris newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published a manifesto by the Italian poet and editor [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. (See the [[Manifesto of Futurism]].) Marinetti coined the word Futurism to reflect his goal of discarding the art of the past and celebrating change, originality, and innovation in culture and society. Marinetti's manifesto glorified the new technology of the [[automobile]] and the beauty of its speed, power, and movement. Exalting violence and conflict, he called for the sweeping repudiation of traditional values and the destruction of cultural institutions such as museums and libraries. The manifesto's rhetoric was passionately bombastic; its aggressive tone was purposely intended to inspire public anger and arouse controversy.

[[File:'Unique Forms of Continuity in Space', 1913 bronze by Umberto Boccioni.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' by Umberto Boccioni.]]

Marinetti's manifesto inspired a group of young painters in Milan to apply Futurist ideas to the visual arts. [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Gino Severini]] published several manifestos on painting in 1910. Like Marinetti, they glorified originality and expressed their disdain for inherited artistic traditions.

Boccioni also became interested in [[sculpture]], publishing a manifesto on the subject in the spring of 1912. He is considered to have most fully realized his theories in two sculptures, ''Development of a Bottle in Space'' (1912), in which he represented both the inner and outer contours of a bottle, and ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913), in which a human figure is not portrayed as one solid form but is instead composed of the multiple planes in space through which the figure moves.

Futurist principles extended to architecture as well. [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] formulated a Futurist manifesto on architecture in 1914. His visionary drawings of highly mechanized cities and boldly modern skyscrapers prefigure some of the most imaginative 20th-century architectural planning.

Boccioni, who had been the most talented artist in the group,&lt;ref&gt;Wilder, Jesse Bryant. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2M4Sm9vL5UcC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq#v= ''Art history for dummies.''] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007. p. 310. Web. 6 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sant'Elia both died during military service in 1916. Boccioni's death, combined with expansion of the group's personnel and the sobering realities of the devastation caused by [[World War I]], effectively brought an end to the Futurist movement as an important historical force in the visual arts.

=== Metaphysical art ===

{{Main|Metaphysical art}}

Metaphysical Painting is an Italian art movement, born in 1917 with the work of Carlo Carrà and [[Giorgio de Chirico]] in Ferrara. The word metaphysical, adopted by De Chirico himself, is core to the poetics of the movement.

They depicted a dreamlike imagery, with figures and objects seemingly frozen in time. Metaphysical Painting artists accept the representation of the visible world in a traditional perspective space, but the unusual arrangement of human beings as dummy-like models, objects in strange, illogical contexts, the unreal lights and colors, the unnatural static of still figures.

=== Novecento Italiano ===

{{Main|Novecento Italiano}}

Novecento movement, group of Italian artists, formed in 1922 in Milan, that advocated a return to the great Italian representational art of the past.
 
The founding members of the Novecento ([[Italian language|Italian]]: 20th-century) movement were the critic [[Margherita Sarfatti]] and seven artists: [[Anselmo Bucci]], [[Leonardo Dudreville]], [[Achille Funi]], Gian Emilio Malerba, Piero Marussig, Ubaldo Oppi, and Mario Sironi. Under Sarfatti's leadership, the group sought to renew Italian art by rejecting European avant-garde movements and embracing Italy's artistic traditions.

Other artists associated with the Novecento included the sculptors [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]] and [[Arturo Martini]] and the painters [[Ottone Rosai]], [[Massimo Campigli]], [[Carlo Carrà]], and [[Felice Casorati]].

=== Spatialism ===

{{Main|Spatialism}}

Movement founded by the Italian artist [[Lucio Fontana]] as the ''movimento spaziale'', its tenets were repeated in manifestos between 1947 and 1954.

Combining elements of concrete art, dada and tachism, the movement's adherents rejected easel painting and embraced new technological developments, seeking to incorporate time and movement in their works. Fontana's slashed and pierced paintings exemplify his theses.

=== Arte Povera ===
{{Culture of Italy}}
{{Main|Arte Povera}}

Arte Povera an artistic movement that originated in Italy in the 1960s, combining aspects of conceptual, minimalist, and performance art, and making use of worthless or common materials such as earth or newspaper, in the hope of subverting the commercialization of art. The phrase is Italian, and means literally, "impoverished art."

=== Transavantgarde ===

{{Main|Transavantgarde}}

The term Transavantgarde is the invention of the Italian critic [[Achille Bonito Oliva]]. He has defined Transavantgarde art as traditional in format (that is, mostly painting or sculpture); apolitical; and, above all else, eclectic.

'''Jem Alan Cohen''' (born 1962) is an [[Afghanistan]]-born [[United States of America|American]] filmmaker based in [[New York City]]. Cohen is especially known for his observational portraits of urban landscapes, blending of media formats ([[16 mm film|sixteen-millimetre]], [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]], [[videotape]]) and collaborations with musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifccenter.com/series/movie-nights-with-jem-cohen/ |title=Movie Nights with Jem Cohen – IFC Center |publisher=Ifccenter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the recipient of the [[Independent Spirit Award]] for feature film-making. "Cohen's films have been broadcast in Europe by the BBC and ZDF/ARTE, and in the United States by the Sundance Channel and P.B.S. They are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney, and Melbourne's Screen Gallery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$artistdetail?COHENJ|title=Opus Luminis et Hominis...|publisher=Vdb.org|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He also makes multichannel installations and still photographs and had a photography show at Robert Miller Gallery in 2009. 
He has received grants from the Guggenheim, [[Creative Capital]], Rockefeller and Alpert Foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaartists.org/content.php?sec=artist&amp;sub=detail&amp;artist_id=121 |title=Jem Cohen - Media Arts Fellow |publisher=Mediaartists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Cohen was born in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] where his father was working for the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (U.S.A.I.D.).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=In focus: Jem Cohen on Museum Hours|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/in-focus-jem-cohen-museum-hours|accessdate=May 26, 2015|work=BFI Film Forever|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1984, with a concentration in film and photography.

==Career==
Cohen found the mainstream Hollywood film industry incompatible with his sociopolitical and artistic views. By applying the [[D.I.Y.]] ethos of Punk Rock to his film-making approach, he crafted a distinct style in his films through various small gauge formats of Super 8, sixteen-millimetre, and videotape. In an interview with web-site ''The Lamp'', Cohen said, "...it's very inspiring to me, to see people kind of take something outside of the industry, outside of the music industry, and it gave me something of a template to work in film outside of the film industry. And there are certainly strains of punk that are activist and that are kind of oppositional in nature to the dominant mainstream culture... that's very inspiring to me..."

Cohen's longer works include his feature film, ''[[Museum Hours]]'', ''[[Chain_(film)|Chain]]'', and the experimental [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Instrument (film)|Instrument]]'', a portrait of the [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] that was ten years in the making. Another film that covers a ten-year arc, ''[[Benjamin Smoke]]'', is about the life of the frontman of the [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] band [[Smoke (band)|Smoke]]. Other works of note are ''[[Lost Book Found]]'', his [[Walter Benjamin]]-inspired portrait of New York City, ''[[Buried in Light]]'', a series of connected Central and Eastern European city portraits, and his [[short film]] about the late [[Elliott Smith]], ''[[Lucky 3|Lucky Three]]''. In 2002, Cohen made ''[[Chain X Three]]'', a precursor to the ''Chain'' feature film, which was exhibited as a three-channel installation. His concert film of the Dutch band [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]], ''[[Building a Broken Mousetrap]]'', premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2006.

Cohen was a resident at [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://eyebeam.org/people/jem-cohen|title = Jem Cohen {{!}} eyebeam.org|date = |access-date = January 2016|website = Eyebeam|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creative Capital - Investing in Artists who Shape the Future|url = http://creative-capital.org/grantees/view/232/project:193|website = creative-capital.org|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Cohen curated the four-day FUSEBOX Festival in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. A celebratory gathering "at the crossroads of film, music, and activism," participants included [[Guy Picciotto]] of Fugazi, [[Patti Smith]] and [[Tom Verlaine]], [[The Evens]], and a side project of Montreal's [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band]], called Thee Silver Mountain Elegies Play War Radio, which formed for the occasion.

Other music artists Cohen has collaborated with over the years include [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Sparklehorse]], [[R.E.M.]], [[T.Griffin]], [[Stephen Vitiello]], [[Miracle Legion]], [[DJ /rupture]], [[Blonde Redhead]], and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

He has also cited that he has previously worked for the film industry as a technician and  prop man, some of the directors he has worked under include [[Alex Cox]], [[John Sayles]], and [[Martin Scorsese]].

In addition to his film-making, Cohen has taught a workshop titled 'Documentary as a Lyrical Force" at the [[International Center of Photography]]. The works of  [[Humphrey Jennings]], [[Helen Levitt]], [[Georges Franju]], [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]], and [[Forugh Farrokhzad]], as well as his own, are discussed.

Photographer [[Sid Grossman]] had been married to Cohen's mother. Grossman was the father of his (half) brother Adam, also a
filmmaker.

[[File:Highlands.jpg|thumb|300px|A "Keep Louisville Weird" billboard in East Louisville's [[The Highlands, Louisville|Highlands]] district, specifically, the [[Bonnycastle, Louisville|Bonnycastle]] neighborhood]]

Shafer}}&lt;/ref&gt; that appears on bumper stickers as well as numerous signs and public buildings throughout [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and its surrounding metro area, especially in [[The Highlands, Louisville|The Highlands]] district. A variation of the slogan, "Keep Highland Weird", is also used in the Highlands district.  It originated from the "[[Keep Austin Weird]]" slogan and is intended to promote [[Small business|local businesses]], though it has evolved into an all-encompassing slogan that secondarily promotes individuality, expressionism, local art, as well as atypical lifestyle choices and leisure activities. The slogan frequently inspires articles and debate that attempt to quantify the exact level to which Louisville is considered [[wikt:weird|weird]], unusual or eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/12/18/louisville-nulu-kentucky-shopping-restaurant-district/4063197/ "Heartland Hotspots: In 'New Louisville,' weird works"]. ''USA Today'', Chie Davis, ''USA TODAY'' December 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louisville Independent Business Alliance is among at least 85 community organizations affiliated with the [[American Independent Business Alliance]], a national non-profit that supports and connects pro-local community-based organizations.

==History==
The slogan was created by the Louisville Independent Business Alliance with the intention of supporting local businesses and small business owners. It was based on the [[Keep Austin Weird]] organization and slogan in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]], and the [[Keep Portland Weird]] slogan used in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], and was brought to Louisville shortly after around 2005.&lt;ref name=birthday /&gt;

'''Korean pagodas''' are a traditional Korean architectural form that began in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period. Koreans created a unique and distinct [[pagoda]] tradition using stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The Korean Overseas Information Service Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK)|title=HELLO from Korea|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973753741|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmtuBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Chai-Shin|title=The New History of Korean Civilization|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462055616|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzVkgoq7npYC&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pagoda {{!}} architecture|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/pagoda|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pagodas were created in India using earth, then in China using wood, which spread to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], and then Japan; however, the pagoda tradition of [[East Asia]] diverged, with China creating pagodas using bricks, Korea creating pagodas using stone, and Japan continuing to use wood.&lt;ref name="stone pagoda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Hong-jun|title=Smiles of the Baby Buddha: Appreciating the Cultural Heritage of Ky?ngju|publisher=창비 Changbi Publishers|isbn=9788936470562|pages=26–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrNxoKa-SQoC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinha|first1=P.

Korean stone pagodas were first created in [[Baekje]] during the early 7th century and then inherited by [[Later Silla]]; 90% of the pagodas in Later Silla were made of stone.&lt;ref name="stone pagoda" /&gt; The stone pagoda tradition was propagated by the great abundance of high quality granite in Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sinha|first1=P.

[[Goryeo]], a devoutly Buddhist state, also inherited the stone pagoda tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jinyoung|first1=Lim|last2=Lyong|first2=Ryoo Seong|title=K-architecture: Tradition Meets Modernity|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973755820|pages=35–36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C_xpBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Korean wood pagodas are the [[Hwangnyongsa|Hwangnyongsa Pagoda]] and [[Palsangjeon]] of Silla.

Throughout the [[history of literature]], since the creation of [[book binding|bound]] texts in the forms of [[books]] and [[codices]], various works have been published and written anonymously, often due to their political or controversial nature, or merely for the purposes of the privacy of their authors, among other reasons. This article provides a '''list of literary works [[anonymous work|published anonymously]]''', either attributed to "[[Anonymity|Anonymous]]", or with no specific author's name given.

Not included in this list are works which predate the advent of [[publishing]] and general attribution of authorship, such as ancient written inscriptions (such as hieroglyphic or pictographical, transcribed texts), certain historical folklore and myths of oral traditions now published as text, and reference or plain texts (letters, notes, graffiti) recovered archaeologically, which are otherwise unimportant to literary studies. [[Religious texts]] and [[grimoires]], which are often written anonymously, may appear, along with works initially written anonymously whose authors are now known.

This list is ordered alphabetically by title.

{{The Protocols}}
This lists early editions of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', an antisemitic forgery purporting to describe a Jewish conspiracy to achieve world domination. For recent editions, see [[Contemporary imprints of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].

==In the [[Russian Empire]]==
'''1902''' M: Mikhail Osipovich Menshikov (1902) - The first textual reference to 
the Protocols, in a far-right newspaper article; claims that they were 
stolen by a "French journalist" in Nice, and quotes a line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===1903===
*In [[Russian language|Russian]], in the newspaper ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]''. The headline in the newspaper was ''Programa zavoevanija mira evrejami'' (''The Jewish Programme to Conquer the World''). The title of ''The Protocols'' (purported) itself was ''The Protocols of the Sessions of the "World Alliance of Freemasons and of the Sages of Zion"''. The publisher was [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Publication was in nine issues of the newspaper, from No. 190 through No. 197 and No. 200, from August to September (old style) or in September (new style).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Existent Manuscript - University of Nebraska Press|url = http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Non-Existent-Manuscript,671722.aspx|website = www.nebraskapress.unl.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIDAS Heritage''' ''– the UK Historic Environment Data Standard'' is a British [[cultural heritage]] standard for recording information on buildings, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, parks and gardens, battlefields, areas of interest and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers UK (ALGAO). Data Standards.  {{cite web|url=http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820014333/http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data standard suggests the minimum level of information needed for recording heritage assets and covers the procedures involved in understanding, protecting and managing these assets. It also provides guidelines on how to support effective sharing of knowledge, [[data retrieval]] and long-term preservation of data.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''MIDAS Heritage'' is freely available to anyone interested in recording historic environment information. It is used by national government organisations, local authorities, heritage sector organisations, amenity groups and societies, the research community and professional contractors.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the standard, ''MIDAS – A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories'', was published by the ''[[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Lee, E., (ed), MIDAS - A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories. The Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England. Swindon (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; (RCHME) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;the Data Hub – The easy way to get, use and share data. (MIDAS – Heritage project) http://ckan.net/dataset/midas-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation merged with ''[[English Heritage]]'' in 1999 and the updated version, ''MIDAS Heritage'', was published in 2007 in collaboration with other UK heritage organisations. The standard was developed by the ''Forum on Information Standards in Heritage'' (FISH), a discussion forum aimed at helping to resolve standards and recording issues for the whole of the heritage sector.&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised version, with more explicit compliance statements, was released in 2012 &lt;https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/midas-heritage/midas-heritage-2012-v1_1.pdf/&gt;

==Coverage==
''MIDAS Heritage'' is a set of closely integrated data standards, rather than one single standard.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with separate standards covering specific types of applications or projects, which will give the necessary [[data element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''SPECTRUM'' (artefacts), ''UK Gemini Discovery Metadata Standard'' (GIS), ''[[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]]'' (concepts and relationships),&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization. ISO 21127:2006 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34424&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records’’.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, P; Newman, M. (2007): “Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records”. 2nd edition.  http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/ifp/ &lt;/ref&gt; MIDAS Heritage complies with the UK e-Government Metadata Standard ([[e-GMS]]),&lt;ref&gt;esd standards, e-GMS-e-Government Metadata Standard, Version 3.0, {{cite web|url=http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118112837/http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard aims only to provide a common information framework and does not cover: what software or file format to use; what to call fields and tables in a database and how they are designed; what indexing terms to use; how to record archives and museum collections, or how to redesign an existing information system.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard.

A '''''money note''''' is a [[music industry]] [[slang]] term which refers to a [[musical form|part]] of a live or recorded singing [[performance]] which is subjectively judged to be very dramatic or emotionally stirring. Created from a confluence of composition or improvisational and performance quality, this is usually at a climactic point of a song or aria, in which the singer's melody makes a large interval jump to the song's highest note (especially for female [[soprano]] singers or male [[tenor]] or [[countertenor]] singers) or falls to its lowest note (especially for male [[bass (voice type)|bass]] or [[baritone]] singers). In some cases, a section or phrase of a vocal melody may captivate the listener's interest because of the tone quality of the singing-either because of the strident emotionalism, or due to the quiet sensitivity of the voice. As well, a "money note" might be an impressive vocal display or a note which is held for a long time with clear pitch and expressive vibrato.  

==In classical music==
In classical music, the term is associated with [[opera]]. In opera, the star singers often have a much higher billing than any of the other participants in the performance, including the conductor of the orchestra. Some opera roles have high notes, such as high "C" notes for sopranos, that are hard to hit in a live performance. As such, the audience enjoys going to see the performance and find out if their favorite performer will be able to sing these high notes with accurate pitch, strong projection, and a clear tone. In this sense, the high notes sung by the opera singer are the "money notes" that the audience is paying to see, and for which the opera singer commands their high salary. 

While "money notes" are often high notes, in some cases, the hard-to-hit notes are low notes sung by a mezzo-soprano or alto female singer, or low notes sung by a bass-baritone singer. Many of the well-known "money notes" written for the tenor voice are from the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 "C"s above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''.  With [[Wagner]] came an emphasis on using the tenor for vocal heft for in protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''[[Heldentenor]]'', a heroic-sounding, bold male voice that listeners find to be very dramatic. 

Achieving "money notes" poses a particular obstacle for classical musicians, as compared to pop musicians, because opera singers do not usually sing with a microphone. While both pop and classical musicians aim at producing well-sung notes with a good tone (with the respective stylistic norms appropriate to each idiom), the pop musician does not have to sing loudly at high sound-pressure levels to be heard, because the amplification of the PA system speakers does this for them. In an opera hall, though, a classical singer has to project their voice over the accompaniment of a symphony orchestra without a microphone or [[PA system]]. In trying to project the voice with at such high volumes, a classical singer may find it harder to maintain an attractive tone quality and correct [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] than a mic-wielding pop singer. To ease the pressure on classical vocalists' voices, major opera halls of the 2000s are increasingly using electronic [[acoustic enhancement]], a subtle type of [[sound reinforcement system]].

As with pop singing styles, the attractiveness or exciting qualities of a live opera vocal performance or recording are subjective and vary between listeners, cultures, and time periods. A soprano singing in the 1930s would elicit praise and applause for hitting a high note in a way that would be deemed unacceptable in the 2000s, because of the use of [[performance practice]]s such as doing a long, drawn-out [[glissando]] up to reach the high note and then using a wide [[vibrato]], wavering on the pitch so much that it is hard to discern which note they are singing.

==In pop and rock music==
In pop music, the term is used because "money notes" on a CD help to 'sell' a song for a listener, and also because  singers capable of performing these emotionally stirring passages are able to make income from the performance.  

One of the most well-known examples of money note can be found in [[Whitney Houston]]'s version of the [[Dolly Parton]] song "[[I Will Always Love You]]", at the beginning of the third rendition of the chorus, there is a pause, a drum beat, a key change, and then Houston belts out the emphatic line  "''' And I''' will always love you." The [[Céline Dion]] song from ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' "[[My Heart Will Go On]]": the key change that begins the third verse — "You're here / There's '''noth'''ing I fear." In the realm of musicals, money notes can be common elements in songs, often becoming as well known as the song themselves. 

The attractiveness or exciting qualities of a singer or recording are subjective and vary between listeners, cultures, and time periods. Different vocal styles are considered to be desirable in different cultures. In Southeast Asia, for example, female pop singers sing with a very high-pitched, nasal tone; while this singing style would be unlikely to create positive responses for most Western listeners, for Asian audiences, the sound of the most popular singers hitting high notes creates a physiological response of emotional excitement. Even within a single culture, the singing styles vary widely from one style to another. Within the [[death metal]] fan subculture, the low, guttural sound of a well-performed "[[death grunt]]" is widely admired; for a typical Western pop or rock listener, though, this type of singing would elicit only puzzlement, not excitement.

==Related terms==

In film production, the slang term "money shot" is used to refer to the most expensive scene of a film, such as a special effects sequence, especially in films from before the era of pre-Computer Generated Imagery, when special effects were done with explosives and stuntpeople rather than computer software. In a 1950s action-adventure film about [[Pearl Harbor]], for example, a costly sequence which depicts the bombing and sinking of US destroyers by exploding and sinking actual, decommissioned vessels would be called the "money shot" of the film. The audiences would expect to see this sequence, given the title of the film, and the financial outcome of the movie would depend on whether the sequence was well done.

In 2008 the French singer [[Camille (singer)|Camille]] released the song "Money Note," which references [[Dolly Parton]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Celine Dion]], and [[Mariah Carey]]. In the chorus Camille swears that "I'll hit the money note," which she does at the end with a piercing, nearly inaudible shriek.

'''Movie Theaters and hand painted Movie Posters in Ghana''' are a cultural component of this West African state.

== History ==
In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpaintedd movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sign painters ==
The artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Musée Dapper 2003, pp.353-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like [[Paa Joe]] or [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in painting their [[Fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]], [[Figurative palanquin|palanquins]] and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo,&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Genèse de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier PréTexte Neuchâtel, 2013, pp. 218-221.&lt;/ref&gt; also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of [[contemporary African art]] where they are getting more and more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang Stäbler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana.

Founded in 1893, the '''National Sculpture Society''' ('''NSS''') was the first organization of professional [[sculptor]]s formed in the [[United States]].  The purpose of the organization was to promote the welfare of American sculptors, although its founding members included several renowned [[architect]]s.  The founding members included such well known figures of the day as [[Daniel Chester French]], [[Augustus St. Gaudens]], [[Richard Morris Hunt]], and [[Stanford White]] as well as sculptors less familiar today, such as [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]], [[Paul W. Bartlett]], [[Karl Bitter]], [[J. Massey Rhind]], and [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]—who served as the first president for the society.

Since its founding in the nineteenth century, the National Sculpture Society (NSS) has remained dedicated to promoting figurative and realistic sculpture. During the years 1919 to 1924, four works commissioned from members of the National Sculpture Society were funded by philanthropist [[Paul Goodloe McIntire]], including ''[[George Rogers Clark (sculpture)|George Rogers Clark]]'' (1921) by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Charlottesville/104-0252_George_Rogers_Clark_Sculpture_1997_Final_Nomination.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: George Rogers Clark Sculpture |author=Betsy Gohdes-Baten |date=April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership worldwide in 2006 was around 4,000 members, including sculptors, architects, art historians, and conservators. Its headquarters, library, and gallery are located on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]], just north of [[Grand Central Terminal]]. There is an entrance to the building from [[Lexington Avenue]] also.

The NSS publishes ''[[Sculpture Review]]'', a quarterly magazine.

Past presidents of the society have included [[John Quincy Adams Ward]], [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]], [[Chester Beach]], [[Wheeler Williams]], [[Leo Friedlander]] and [[Cecil de Blaquiere Howard]].

The first woman to gain admission into the NSS was [[Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson]], in 1895. She was followed a few years later by [[Enid Yandell]], in 1899 and [[Abastenia St. Leger Eberle]] in 1906. In 1946 [[Richmond Barthé]] was likely the first [[African-American]] to be admitted.

In 1994 the NSS held their first exhibition outside the United States at the Palazzo Mediceo Di Seravezza in Italy.  Titled “100 Years of the National Sculpture Society of the United States of America in Italy” it ran from the 16th of July through the 4th of September and was curated by Nicky and [[Stanley Bleifeld]] along with Costantino Paolicchi in collaboration with Lodovico Gierut and Paolo Giorgi.  Among the 60 notable American sculptors whose work was selected for the exhibition were [[Stanley Bleifeld]], [[Andrew DeVries]], Neil Estern, Leonda Finke, [[Bruno Lucchesi]], Barbara Lekberg, [[Richard MacDonald]] and Elliott Offner.&lt;ref&gt;National Sculpture Society, Finito di stampare nel mese di luglio 1994 dalle EDIZIONI ETS Pisa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omphalion''' in Greek means "navel (of the earth)"; compare the ''[[omphalos]]'' of [[Delphi]].

==Hagia Sophia==
[[File:Omphalion ste-sophie istanbul 15 oct 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Omphalion at the [[Hagia Sophia]] (2011)]]
One of the most intriguing features of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=751}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant [[marble]], with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Fabio|title=Walking on Water: Cosmic Floors in Antiquity and the Middle Ages|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=Dec 2007|volume=89|issue=4|url=https://search.proquest.com/artshumanities/docview/222978706/B6040F5BF77A497BPQ/7|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at [[Hosios Loukas]] in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a "jeweled style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=98|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used [[Tessera|tesserae]] of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.

Historically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the [[coronation]] ceremony. Evidence of this comes from [[Anthony of Novgorod|Antony of Novgorod]], who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote "there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, [[Hosios Loukas|Hosios Lukas]] and [[Nea Moni of Chios|Nea Moni]]. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schibille|first1=Nadine|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=99|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Byzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of [[spolia]] to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadine|first1=Schibille|title=Hagia Sophia and the Byzantine Aesthetic Experience|date=2014-11-28|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781472447951|page=100|url=https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/lib/psu/detail.action?docID=1808795|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedone|first1=Silvia|title=The Marble Omphalos of Saint Sophia in Constantinople|date=2011|page=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Omphalia==
The word ''omphalion'' is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.

The marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in [[Trabzon]] (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to [[Thessalonica]] by Greek refugees in 1924.

A '''''parti pris'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stevens Curl|title="parti." |work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2000|accessdate=May 17, 2009|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-parti.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an organizing thought or decision behind an architect's [[design]],  presented in the form of a basic diagram or a simple statement.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Francis D. K. (1995). A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. p. 53. {{ISBN|0-442-02462-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be shortened to "parti". The term comes from 15th century French, in which "parti pris" meant "decision taken." Later, it took on the meaning of "bias" or "prejudice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arch100and110.blogspot.com/2012/11/parti.html|title=An Introduction to Architecture and Visual Communications: parti|first=Blue|last=One|date=21 November 2012|website=Arch100and110.blogspot.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term developed in a particularly Euro-centric context of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France in which the proponents were predominantly white, male and well-to-do.

The development of the parti frequently precedes the development of [[Architectural plan|plan]], [[Architectural drawing#Cross section|section]], and [[Architectural drawing#Elevation|elevation]] diagrams.&lt;ref name=medium&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/applying-architecture-to-product-design/applying-architecture-to-product-design-parti-68b0b7345db9#.p0d87v6lc |title=Applying Architecture to Product Design: Parti |last1=Mandelbaum |first1=Melissa |website=Medium.com  |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that it defines the organizing thought prior to research, exploration, collaboration and the development of intentions, the "parti" is a passé approach to architectural design. Critics argue that recent historical attempts to recover the term for contemporary times are conservative and nostalgic for a simpler time. They make the case that parti is a stand in for a formalist approach to architecture that abdicates responsibility and social engagement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">The '''Public Monuments and Sculpture Association''', or PMSA, was established in 1991 to bring together individuals and organisations with an interest in British public sculptures and monuments, their production, preservation and history.

The primary aim of the PMSA is to heighten public awareness of [[UK|Britain]]'s monumental heritage— past, present, and future—through activities, publications and dialogue. It campaigns for the listing, preservation, protection and restoration of public monuments and sculpture, covering a period from the Stuart monarchy to the present day. As well as campaigning for historic monuments and public sculpture, the PMSA has been active in promoting the commissioning of new public monuments and sculpture.

The PMSA's founding members were Jo Darke, with the writer, lecturer and broadcaster Paul Atterbury, Ian Leith of the [[English Heritage Archive|National Monuments Record]], and Catherine Moriarty, then Co-ordinator of the [[UK National Inventory of War Memorials|National Inventory of War Memorials]], which was founded in 1989 to create a database of war memorials throughout the UK.

From the beginning, the PMSA was actively encouraged by the writer and sculpture scholar [[Benedict Read]], and by Andrew and Janet Naylor, metal sculpture conservators. Subscriptions were opened in May 1991 and membership has now stabilised at around 250. Since 1991, the PMSA has initiated the National Recording Project and collaborated with the publishers [[Liverpool University Press]] on the acclaimed series ''Public Sculpture of Britain'', and has established the much respected bi-annual Sculpture Journal. It has set up events, conferences and publications in collaboration with English Heritage, the UK Institute of Conservators, [[University College Dublin]] and many other similar institutions. The PMSA operates an advisory service and distributes newsletters and newssheets to its members.

The latest projects include collaboration with other organisations and individuals to oversee production of the Custodians Handbook, published in 2005 and occasionally updated. It was designed to give guidance to families and individuals who inherit sculptors' works, studios, archives and memorabilia; and the campaign Save our Sculpture (SoS) was set to encourage concerned members of the public to keep watch over their neighbourhood sculptures, and to report damage or negligence to the PMSA. Another project is creating a digital database of public sculptures and monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/05032014-digital-database-uk-sculpture-planned|title=Digital database planned for UK sculpture| first=Geraldine| last=Kendall| date=5 March 2014| journal=[[Museums Journal]]| accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association is a charitable company which is run by a board comprising its Director and the Trustees, known as the General Committee. Ad hoc sub-committees are established to organise events, projects or campaigns.

The President of the PMSA is the Duke of Gloucester and the chairman is John Lewis, OBE. It is based at 70 [[Cowcross Street]], London.&lt;ref name=PMSA&gt;{{cite web| title=Contact us| url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/about/contact-us/| website=PMSA| accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Retting''' is a process employing the action of micro-organisms and moisture  on plants to dissolve or rot away much of the cellular tissues and [[pectin]]s surrounding [[Bast fibre|bast-fibre]] bundles, and so facilitating separation of the [[Fiber|fibre]] from the stem.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit&gt;retting. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 03, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/500159/retting&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the production of fibre from plant materials such as [[flax]] and [[hemp]] stalks and [[coir]] from [[coconut]] husks.

==Water retting==
The most widely practised method of retting, water retting, is performed by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating to the central stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then retted again.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

''Natural water retting'' employs stagnant or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, bogs, and slow streams and rivers. The stalk bundles are weighted down, usually with stones or wood, for about 8 to 14 days, depending upon water temperature and mineral content.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

''Tank retting'', by contrast, employs vats usually made of concrete, requires about four to six days, and is feasible in any season. In the first six to eight hours, called the leaching period, much of the dirt and colouring matter is removed by the water, which is usually changed to assure clean fibre. Waste retting water, which requires treatment to reduce harmful toxic elements before its release, is rich in plant minerals, such as nitrates, and can be used as liquid fertilizer.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

==Dew retting==
[[File:Flax field Fecamp 01.JPG|thumb|Dew retting of flax in France.]]
This is a common method in areas with limited water resources. It is most effective in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. Dew-retted fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than water-retted fibre.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

== After retting ==

The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in open air or by mechanical means, and are frequently stored for a short period to allow "curing" to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the [[scutching]] operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and scutching operations. Waste material from the first scutching, consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre ([[tow]]) thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

The '''Society for Natural Language Technology Research''' (abbr. as '''SNLTR''') is an organization that promotes research in Corpus Linguistics, Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing in [[Bengali language]]. Among its primary goals are creation and archiving of a fully [[Unicode]]-compatible [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literary corpus to be hosted and published online, as well as the creation of fonts that will help people type Bengali text with ease.

== About SNLTR ==

English is still the primary medium of interaction with computers. Consequently, a large section of the population in India is not able to reap the benefits of the technology. Though the issue of localization of interface has been discussed in different forum, the goal is yet to be achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In spite of the fact that desktop publishing has come of age for Bengali and other Indian languages and there are several software available for Bengali, the problem persists due to the absence of i) standardization of Bengali encoding, ii) encoding compliant font design, iii) availability of compliant keyboard layouts etc. The lack of adherence to standard does not allow the computing activities in Indian languages to be inter-operable across computing platforms.

In order to make the computing activities Bengali compatible, it is essential to establish a proper standard. Though a number of organizations have taken up language processing activities, the necessity of establishing proper coherence among them is very much felt, in order to deliver useful products.

Language Technology research has to focus on two components, written text as well as spoken language .Besides text processing, speech generation and recognition are two very important areas in which research and development have to be focused. This development will not only result in more natural human-computer interfaces, but will also empower the physically challenged like those with speech impairment and visual impairment, to benefit from computer technology.

The Society for Natural Language Technology Research has been formed to address the above-mentioned requirements. The society has been seeded by the Government of West Bengal (Dept. of Information Technology) with initial funding and support. Operationally, the society aims to carry out its activities in a multipolar manner, involving other academic and research institutes as well as industries.

Data Representation and Encoding Standard: Society for Natural Language Technology Research has decided to accept UNICODE 5.0 and upwards as the standard for data representation and encoding for Bengali.

== Mission and Goals ==

* To develop technology and standards to make computer usage Bengali enabled.
* To spread out the benefits of language technology research to real life activities including official works, education, and literature through development of suitable applications.
* To establish a collaborative environment of natural language processing related activities with educational and research organizations as well as with industries.

The immediate goals of the society are:
* To establish standards for Bengali text processing to ensure interoperability across platforms.
* To develop large standardized corpus for Bengali text and speech.
* To create an ensemble of available Bengali software and corpus in a standardized form and make them easily available to all.
* To develop new software and modify or enhance the existing software.
* To develop suitable speech Technology for Bengali.
* To work towards similar development for other Eastern Indian Languages.

'''''Spring Day''''' (Russian: [http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C_(%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%9D._%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0) ''Весенний день (картина Н. Позднеева)''] is a painting by the well-known Russian artist [[Nikolai Pozdneev|Nikolai Matveevich Pozdneev]]&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Members of the Union of Artists of USSR. Volume 2.''- Moscow: Soviet artist, 1979. P. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; (1930–1978). It attempts to convey the mood of Soviet society of the late 1950s to the early 1960s.

==History==
''Spring Day'' was one of the first original genre compositions by Nikolai Pozdneev. He developed the theme for the first time raised three years earlier in his graduate painting ''From the School'' (1956, now reside in collection of the Pskov Painting Gallery). The first version of painting shown in 1960 on the principal Art Show in Leningrad&lt;ref&gt;''Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1960. Exhibition catalogue.'' - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1961. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Moscow&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Russia. The Republic Exhibition of 1960. Exhibition catalogue.'' - Moscow: Soviet Artist, 1960. P. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; the author does not fully satisfied. Pozdneev repainted the picture, making it a more extended vertically. A group of children has shifted from the center to the upper left corner. The bold decision proved justified: composition of the painting acquired aspiration, which is consistent with the general concept of the work. Were reinforced color accents, the lighter has become the whole palette of the picture. As a result, in the work began to fully feel the air of spring and hope, in tune with the mood of the era turn of the decades.

From 1960 to 1980, ''Spring Day'' was kept in the artist's family. In 1994, after a long pause, it was featured at the [[Leningrad painting of 1950-1980s (Saint Petersburg, 1994)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School'']] Art Show in the Exhibition Halls of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paintings of 1950-1980s by the Leningrad School's artists. Exhibition catalogue.'' Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg Union of Artists, 1994. P.4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995-1996 ''Spring Day'' was exhibited in Saint Petersburg in the ''Nekrasov Memorial Museum'' at the exhibitions [[Lyrical motifs in postwar Leningrad painting (Saint Petersburg, 1995)|''The Lyrical motive in painting of artists of the WWII generation'']],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyrical motifs in postwar Leningrad painting (Saint Petersburg, 1995)|''Lyrical motives in the works of artists of the WWII generation. Painting, drawings. Exhibition catalogue.'']] Saint Petersburg, Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial museum, 1995. P.6.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School (Saint Petersburg, 1996)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School (Saint Petersburg, 1996)|''Painting of 1940-1990s. The Leningrad School. Exhibition catalogue'']]. Saint Petersburg, Nikolai Nekrasov Memorial museum, 1996. P.6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting was reproduced on the official poster and cover of exhibition catalog. 

In 2007 the ''Spring Day'' was reproduced and described among 350 art works by Leningrad artists in the book «''Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School''»,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%86%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BC._%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0 Sergei V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">'''Stoorn''' is a giant wooden [[moose|elk (moose)]]&lt;ref&gt;The word "elk" is here used in the European sense, what is normally referred to as a "moose" in [[American English]]. The American [[elk]] is an animal more similar to the [[red deer]].&lt;/ref&gt; planned to be built in northern [[Norrland]] in [[Sweden]]. The elk, intended as a tourist attraction, will be 45&amp;nbsp;m (148&amp;nbsp;ft) high, 47&amp;nbsp;m (154&amp;nbsp;ft) long, and will contain three floors of 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each, and one floor of 250 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It will hold a restaurant, conference centre and a 350-capacity concert hall. There will be a panorama deck in the [[antler]]s. Access to the body of the elk will be through an elevator in a large pine tree the elk will appear to be biting on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skelleftea.se/default.asp?id=7117&amp;refid=1173 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070623105636/http://www.skelleftea.se/default.asp?id=7117&amp;refid=1173 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-06-23 | title = Stoorn - Världens största älg | publisher = [[Skellefteå]] municipality | author = Anna Lindfors | date = 2006-01-25 | accessdate = 2007-11-30}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The elk is of such magnitude that while its front legs will be positioned in [[Arvidsjaur Municipality|Arvidsjaur]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] in the [[Counties of Sweden|county]] of [[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]], the hind legs will be in [[Skellefteå Municipality|Skellefteå]] in [[Västerbotten County|Västerbotten]]. Because of these circumstances, it took a while for the $9 million project to get approval, but in November 2007 it received its go-ahead, and building was planned to start before the end of the year. As of March 2011 nothing has happened.&lt;ref name="The Local"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/9219/ |title='World's largest elk' to be built in Sweden |publisher=[[The Local]] |author=Paul O'Mahony |date=2006-11-26 |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130191312/http://www.thelocal.se/9219/ |archivedate=2007-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Stoorn" means "the big one" in the local dialect.&lt;ref name="The Local" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13655">[[File:CSaint-Saens.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|alt=bust-length portrait of Saint-Saëns with a beard in a vest and suit, looking at the viewer|Saint-Saëns photographed by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]]]]
The '''Symphony No. 3 in [[C minor]]''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 78, was completed by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] in 1886 at what was probably the artistic peak of his career. It is also popularly known as the ''Organ Symphony'', even though it is not a true [[symphony for organ]], but simply an orchestral symphony where two sections out of four use the [[pipe organ]]. The composer inscribed it as: ''Symphonie No. 3 "avec orgue"'' (with organ).

Of composing the work Saint-Saëns said "I gave everything to it I was able to give. What I have here accomplished, I will never achieve again."&lt;ref name="Dubal"&gt;Camille Saint-Saëns quoted in David Dubal, ''The Essential Canon of Classical Music'', New York, 2003, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; The composer seemed to know it would be his last attempt at the symphonic form, and he wrote the work almost as a type of "history" of his own career: virtuoso piano passages, brilliant orchestral writing characteristic of [[Romantic music|the Romantic period]], and the sound of a cathedral-sized pipe organ.

The symphony was commissioned by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in England, and the first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at [[St James's Hall]], conducted by the composer. After the death of his friend [[Franz Liszt]] on 31 July 1886, Saint-Saëns dedicated the work to Liszt's memory. The composer also conducted the symphony's French premiere in January 1887.&lt;ref name="BSO" /&gt;

==Structure==
Although the symphony seems to follow the normal four-movement structure, and many recordings divide it in this manner, it was actually written in two movements: Saint-Saëns intended to create a novel two-movement symphony. The composer did note in his own analysis of the symphony, however, that while it was cast in two movements, "the traditional four movement structure is maintained."

A typical performance of the symphony usually lasts for about 35 minutes. One of its most outstanding and original features is Saint-Saëns' ingenious use of keyboard instruments—piano, scored for both two and [[Piano four hands|four hands]] at various places, and an organ. The symphony also makes innovative use of [[cyclic form|cyclic]] thematic material. Saint-Saëns adapted Liszt's methods of thematic transformation, so that the subjects evolve throughout the duration of the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/feb/25/symphony-guide-saint-saens-organ-tom-service|title=Symphony guide: Saint-Saëns's Third (the Organ symphony)|first=Tom|last=Service|date=25 February 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation and score==
The symphony is scored for an orchestra comprising 3 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (1 doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[piano]] (two and four hands), [[pipe organ|organ]], and [[string section|strings]].

# [[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] – [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|moderato]] – Poco adagio
# Allegro moderato – [[Presto (music)|Presto]] – Maestoso – Allegro

After its slow introduction, the first movement leads to a theme of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian]] (or [[Franz Schubert|Schubertian]]) character, followed by a second subject of a gentler cast, with various secondary themes played in major, and soon after repeated in minor forms; chromatic patterns play an important role in both movements. This material is worked out in fairly classical [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]], and gradually fades to a quieter mood, which becomes a slightly ominous series of plucked notes in [[cello]] and [[Double bass|bass]], ending on a G pitch, followed by a slow and soft sustained A-flat note in the organ, resolving into the new key of [[D-flat major|D flat]] for the Poco adagio section of the movement. This evolves as a beautiful dialogue between organ and strings, recalling the earlier main theme of the movement before the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]]. The movement ends in a quiet [[Dynamics (music)#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|morendo]].

The second movement opens with an energetic string melody, which gives way to a Presto version of the main theme, complete with extremely rapid [[Scale (music)|scale]] passages in the piano. The Maestoso is introduced by a full [[C major]] chord in the organ. Piano four-hands is heard at the beginning with the strings, now playing the C major evolution of the original theme. The theme is then repeated in powerful organ chords, interspersed with brass fanfares. This well-known movement is considerably varied, including as it does [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Fugue|fugal]] writing and a brief pastoral interlude, replaced by a massive climax of the whole symphony characterised by a return to the introductory theme in the form of [[Major scale|major-scale]] [[Variation (music)|variations]]. 

==Performances==
The first performance was given in London on 19 May 1886, at [[St James's Hall]], conducted by the composer.
The French premiere was on 9 January 1887, conducted by the composer, at a concert of the Société des Concerts.&lt;ref name="BSO"&gt;[http://www.bso.org/images/program_notes/20080206.pdf BSO Program Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924191354/http://bso.org/images/program_notes/20080206.pdf |date=2010-09-24 }}{{failed verification |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States premiere was given on 19 February 1887, conducted by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]], at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]], New York City.&lt;ref name="BSO" /&gt; In May, 1915, Saint-Saëns traveled to San Francisco as France's Official Representative to the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]]. He attended a performance of the Symphony No. 3 at the 3,782 seat Festival Hall. [[Karl Muck]] conducted the [[San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]]. The composer was given a standing ovation at the performance, which was also attended by composer [[John Philip Sousa]]. Saint-Saëns composed another piece especially for the occasion called "Hail California," which included Sousa's famous band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madmonkmusicpress.com/shop-devlin/saint-saens-finale-to-hail-california|title=Saint-Saëns: "Finale" to HAIL! CALIFORNIA|website=Mad Monk Music Press|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was performed by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] at the 2009 [[The Proms|BBC Proms]] season as the finale to a concert celebrating the 800th anniversary of the [[University of Cambridge]], as the composer was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 1893.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2009/whatson/2207.shtml#plus1 |title=Proms 27 July 2009 |publisher=[[BBC Proms]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 season, it was performed again by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]], and in 2013, it returned to the BBC Proms, this time with [[Paavo Järvi]] conducting the [[Orchestre de Paris]].&lt;ref name="BBC_1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/rz38q9/series |title=Proms 67 Sep 2013 |publisher=[[BBC Proms]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
The symphony continues to be a frequently performed and recorded part of the standard repertoire. One of the most renowned recordings{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} is by [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]] leading the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], with [[Berj Zamkochian]] at the organ. [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] recorded the Symphony No. 3 several times, with [[Virgil Fox]], [[E. Power Biggs]], and [[Michael Murray (organist)|Michael Murray]] as the organists.

In 2006, the [[Ondine (record label)|Ondine]] label recorded [[Olivier Latry]] performing the symphony at the inaugural concert of the Fred J. Cooper Memorial Organ in [[Verizon Hall]], with [[Christoph Eschenbach]] conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Ondine released the recording in 2007 on SACD in 5.0 surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ondine.net/index.php?lid=en&amp;cid=2.2&amp;oid=2571|title=Ondine Release|website=www.ondine.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-regarded recording of the work is the [[Mercury Records]] "Living Presence" recording made in 1957 with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Paul Paray]] with [[Marcel Dupré]] on organ. It has been reissued on CD as Mercury #432719-2. [[Simon Preston]] made a recording in 1986 with [[James Levine]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] for [[Deutsche Grammophon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/cat/single?PRODUCT_NR=4779969|title=SAINT-SAËNS / DUKAS / BERLIOZ Levine - Download - Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft|website=www.deutschegrammophon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main theme of the Maestoso==
===Influences===
It has been argued that themes within the symphony are derived from the Gregorian [[plainsong]] melody [[Dies_Irae#Music|''Dies Irae'']] commonly heard in the [[Requiem|Roman Catholic Requiem Mass]].&lt;ref name="HSB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houstonsymphonyblog.org/04/30/organ-symphony/ |title=Houston Symphony Blog|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CFM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/composers/saint-saens/guides/organ-symphony-jane-jones/|title=Saint-Saens' Organ Symphony: the work that could not be surpassed|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directness of the connection is disputed by some, such as Dutch conductor {{ill|Daan Admiraal|nl}}, who nevertheless notes relations to various Gregorian ''Alleluia'' chant-formulas, especially for the major form of the principal theme of the Maestoso to ''Sacratum hoc templum Dei''.&lt;ref name="ADMIRAAL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daanadmiraal.nl/Articles/SS3.htm |title=Saint-Saëns, Symphony 3 'Organ'. A short introduction with 15 musical examples.|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this principal theme of the Maestoso may not constitute as straightforward a use of the ''Dies Irae'' theme as can be found in many other works, such as the [[Totentanz_(Liszt)|Totentanz]] of Franz Liszt, its initial melody and chord progression is a direct [[Musical_quotation|quote]] of the popular ''Ave Maria'' arrangement of French composer [[Pierre-Louis Dietsch]] (1808-1865) attributed to Franco-Flemish Renaissance composer [[Jacques Arcadelt]], which Liszt also arranged for solo piano and published as ''Chanson D'Arcadelt "Ave Maria" (S.183)'' in 1865.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
The entire main theme of the Maestoso was later adapted and used in the 1977 pop-song "[[If I Had Words]]" by [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Yvonne Keeley]]. The Maestoso movement is also included as the final piece of music in the soundtrack for the film [[Impressions de France]], which plays in the [[France (Epcot)|France pavilion]] at [[Epcot]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. The song and the symphony were used as the main theme in the 1995 family film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its 1998 sequel ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' and can be heard in the 1989 comedy, ''[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]''.

The piece is also featured in the [[Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps]] 2008 show "Le Tour: Every Second Counts" in the finale. The tune of the symphony also serves as the national anthem of the [[micronation]] of the [[Empire of Atlantium]] under the name "Auroran Hymn". Although not included in the soundtrack, the Maestoso movement can be heard along with [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|9th Symphony]] in [[Emir Kusturica]]'s film ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''. The Maestoso also served as the opening work on [[Laserium]]'s first all-classical [[Laser_lighting_display|show]] (and the first to have an actual plot), ''Crystal Odyssey.'' The composer [[Philip Sparke]] created a [[brass band]] test piece based on the symphony which was then assigned to Fourth Section bands for the [[National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain]] in 2010.

'''''The House Next Door''''' is a 2006 [[Lifetime Television]] film, directed by [[Jeff Woolnough]] and starring [[Mark-Paul Gosselaar]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Colin Ferguson (actor)|Colin Ferguson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifetimewow.blogspot.com/2009/01/house-next-door.html Lifetime, Wow!: The House Next Door]&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the [[The House Next Door (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Anne Rivers Siddons]]
==Plot==
The peaceful and happy life of Walker and Col Kennedy is interrupted when Kim, a brilliant and attractive male architect, builds a dream house next to theirs. All the people who move into the house turn evil or end up having "accidents" and unexplainable deaths. They realize that the house targets their fears and feeds off of them until it drives them insane. In the end, the Kennedys succeed in destroying the house, killing the architect in the process. In the final scene another couple is seen eyeing a new house identical to the old one. This is the greatest departure from the novel, in which the Kennedys kill the architect before trying to destroy the house &amp;ndash; in the epilogue it is revealed that they themselves lost their lives and the house is still intact.

[[File:Huttner.hitler.melbourne.jpg|thumb|right| Installation view of poster project “Young Dictators” (Hitler as child), by Per Hüttner at public location in Melbourne, September 2009.]]
'''The Invisible Generation''' was a contemporary art project conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and organized by [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in  [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation"&gt;The Invisible Generation, ed. Gerrie van Noord, design Marie Proyard, Published by Vision Forum, Stockholm, Sweden. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most projects were realized in contexts where the audience does not necessarily expect to find artwork. In the metro (Dinu Li, Per Hüttner), in a newspaper office (Yan Jun), on a public square (Natasha Rosling) or even contained as a story in the mind of a person in a shop (Good TV). In other instances the project played with the perceived immutability of the artwork. The audience was asked to actively create or re-create artwork (The Anti-Hospital), remove or destroy drawings (Jean-François Robardet), bring books to be changed (Private Contractors) or in some cases it was disguised as an informative poster, graffity or political propaganda (Huang Xiaopeng, Per Hüttner).

The inspiration and title is taken from a text by [[William S. Burroughs]] where he describes a series of situation where a tape recorder is used to create new forms of meeting between people and new forms of engagement with the media.

==Melbourne, September 2009==
The first part of The Invisible Generation opened to the public in Australia in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1252072574&amp;day=1253138400&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation was co-curated by Hüttner and Balit. It was introduced at the [[Margaret Lawrence Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vca.unimelb.edu.au/gallarchive09/#cs_3602&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the starting point for a number of interventions in the public space of the city. In the gallery were two major installations presented: Do Not Go Gentle Court by Per Hüttner and Polka Dot by French artist Mark Geffriaud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fracidf-leplateau.com/en/index.html  The work is in the collection of FRAC Île de France]&lt;/ref&gt; The two works redefine the gallery experience through reflections on the fabric of space and time. Being situated at the boundaries between installation and performance, they delineated a space that was the starting point for the Anti-Hospital, an open-ended and evolving platform which formed the core of the project. The Anti-Hospital was designed by Melbourne-based collective Greatest Hits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatesthitswebsite.com/the-invisible-generation.html&lt;/ref&gt; and focused around a collection of artistic documents providing instructions that were formulated as possible actions, performances, temporary artworks, objects and social situations, scores and sonic interventions proposed by absent artists and realized by local artists, non-artists and visitors to the gallery. Greatest Hits created a dozen videos that enacted, played with and read out the instructions and together created a sort of manual to aid and inspire the visitor to relate to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://tig-melbourne.blogspot.com/2009/12/greatest-hits-video-excerpt-montage.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructions were interpreted, primarily by local artists while the exhibition was open to the public.

For the period of the exhibition the Anti-Hospital also coordinated a series of events, performances, actions, workshops and ways of disseminating the instructions through the media and the urban space of Melbourne including, local artists, students and a program on the screen and LEDs at Federation Square. This included the controversial project “Young Dictators” conceived and realized by Per Hüttner with two local students. The three put up 2000 copies of A4 sized posters around the city showing images of dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] as children with the text “Have you seen this child? Please contact 0432 027 925” (Hüttner’s mobile number).

[[File:Dinu.li.low.jpg|thumb|right| Video stills of Dinu Li's performance on the Shenzhen Metro that was part of The Invisible Generation, November 2009.]]

==Shenzhen October 2009==
Where the presentation in Melbourne focused on the relationship between suspended instructions in the gallery and interventions in the public space, the project in Shenzhen consisted mostly of unannounced performances in the public space and hosted by the contemporary art museum OCAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocat.com.cn Official OCAT website]&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in political, economical, social and architectural context also meant the dynamics of the project changed greatly and made the participation of the local audience more difficult to achieve, but all the more successful on the occasions where it happened. Presentations included carnivalesque costumes appearing in public space as temporary and wearable architectural elements by Natasha Rosling. Yang Zhifei carried a giant white pillow through the streets of the city and she let an army of people sleep in public spaces, each with a normally sized pillow under their head. She also organized a dream workshop to compare the dreams of the Chinese with those of the Dutch. [[Dinu Li]] created a choreography of corruption and guilt on the Shenzhen underground provoking fear in the audience and laying bare how deep inside the psyches of its citizens a [[totalitarian]] government can reach. Neno Belchev designed a portable zebra crossings to facilitate [[jaywalking]], a passion shared by the Chinese and [[Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|left| Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

==Beijing July 2009 – July 2010==
The events in Beijing took place over a whole year and culminated in a large presentation at [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucca.org.cn/portal/activitie/view.798?id=520&amp;lang=en&amp;menuId=28&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations kicked off with summer 2009 with Jon Phillips and [[Matt Hope|Matt Hope’s]] speaker event "Laoban Sound System" in conjunction with [[Ai Weiwei|Ai Weiwei’s]] day without internet. The two has since launched a range of events in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://laoban-soundsystem.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included Yan Jun’s sonic material slipped into the desk drawers at Beijing Youth Weekly editorial office and interviews from the same newspaper that were replayed and perverted over 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdcagespace.com/index.php?/next-episode/yan-jun/&lt;/ref&gt; Good TV collected memories of images that had been lost for different reasons. collection of lost images retold by storytellers in their everyday life in the Wudaoying Hutong (五道营胡同). The Beijing context and the proximity to the centre of political power allowed “This Image Is No More” to develop another layer of interpretation which had been lacking in its realization in Europe. Both Natasha Rosling and Yang Zhifei created versions of their projects from Shenzhen in Beijing. Especially the giant white pillow carried through the streets the Chinese capital to mirrored its grandiose buildings in ways that also inspired interesting reactions among the unassuming audience.

==Kiev, November 2009 and July 2010==
In November Yulia Usova and PAI organised a series of talks in Kiev that approached issues such as [[Cultural heritage management|curation]] and art in public spaces and included speakers such as [[Olesya Turkina]], [[Olav Westphalen]] and Karen MacDonald. In conjunction with this a group of students from [[Kungliga Konsthögskolan]] in [[Stockholm]] made a series of improvised performances at [[Les Kurbas’ Theater Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurbas.org.ua/en/les_kurbas.html Les Kurbas presentation in English]&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the project took place during the [[swine flu]] epidemic in Ukraine  all public theatre events were stopped and schools closed giving the whole event a very special flavour.

The actual project was scheduled to be realized in April 2010, but had to be cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud that prevented air travel in Europe at the given time and only web-performances were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1271946267&amp;day=1271973600&lt;/ref&gt; The project was realized 19 June and 2–4 July 2010 and was co-curated by Per Hüttner and Yulia Usova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.se/Creative-Force/Start/Creative-Force/News/Nyheter/Invisible-generation/&lt;/ref&gt; The project saw a meeting between artists from China, Western Europe and Ukraine. Rumours claim that artists met with great problems with local authorities including arrests, theft by undercover policemen and that the artists had to bribe officials to be able to leave the country.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

==Documentation and talks==
Since most of the events in The Invisible Generation only had an unexpecting audience, the organizers present the documentation of the project in various art institutions around the world, including UCCA in Beijing and Norrköpings Konstmuseum in Sweden. Vision Forum has also published an extensive catalogue about The Invisible Generation in 2011. It was edited by Gerrie van Noord and includes all the original instructions presented in Melbourne. The publication also contains texts by Daniele Balit, Per Hüttner, Olav Westphalen and incidentally contains a reproduction of this page. The book is framed by three texts by the editor, Gerrie van Noord where she reflects on the difficulty and necessity of mediating projects ephemeral projects like The Invisible Generation.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

'''Tucking''' is a technique whereby an individual hides the [[wikt:Thesaurus:male crotch bulge|crotch bulge]] of the penis and testicles so that they are not conspicuous through clothing.

The practice is most commonly employed by [[transgender women]] in order to [[Methods of passing as female|pass as female]], as well as [[cisgender]] men that do [[Drag queen|drag]]. There are fertility-related side-effects to tucking, such as a reduced sperm count.&lt;ref&gt;Ducheny, Kelly M., and Randall D. Ehrbar. "Family creation options for transgender and gender nonconforming people." Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity 3.2 (2016): 173&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of clothing, such as gaffs and bloxers are purposefully designed to inadvertently conceal the male crotch bulge.

== Methods ==
One method of tucking involves pulling the penis backwards in between the legs while simultaneously pushing the testicles up into the [[inguinal canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Pyne, Jake. "Unsuitable bodies: Trans people and cisnormativity in shelter services." Canadian Social Work Review/Revue canadienne de service social 28.1 (2011): 129-137&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure this position in place, some trans women may use especially tight undergarments and a leotard that has a strap.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo, Maria San. "Female Trouble: Representing Transwomen in The Danish Girl and The New Girlfriend." Journal of Bisexuality 16.3 (2016): 403-407.&lt;/ref&gt; Another practice is the flattening or binding by using tape to fasten the genitalia along the perineum and if possible in between the buttocks. There are also improvised or home-made contrivances whereby an elastic waistband is cut off from an existing garment and then a pouch placed along the middle to then be pulled up.&lt;ref&gt;Conard, L. A. E. "Supporting and caring for transgender and gender nonconforming youth in the urology practice." Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Man|male]] [[cross-dresser]]s and pre- and non-op transgender women use purpose-made [[Panties|panty]]-like [[clothing|garment]]s, often called '''gaffs''', that serve to hide the genitalia and provide a feminine flat and smooth [[Groin|crotch]] area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://library.transgenderzone.com/?page_id=114 Penis - methods of concealment and obtaining a 'flat-look' for pre-op  male-to-female transgender people]," Samantha Johnson, Transgender Zone&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) maintains many cemeteries specifically devoted to veterans. Most have various rules regarding what must take place in order to be interred there.

==Procedure==
The VA only permits graphics on Government-furnished headstones or markers that are approved emblems of belief, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Union Army|Union Shield]] (including those who served in the U.S. military through the [[Spanish–American War]]), the [[Confederate States of America|Civil War Confederate]] [[Southern Cross of Honor]], and the [[Medal of Honor]] insignia. [[Arlington National Cemetery]] has similar restrictions on headstones, though it is maintained by [[US Department of the Army]].

The [[religious symbol]]s are rendered as simple [[Monumental inscription|inscriptions]] without sculptural [[relief]] or coloring other than [[black]]. The emblem of belief is an optional feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Funerals/Scheduling-a-Funeral/Headstones-and-Niche-Covers/Government-Headstone-Niche-Covers |title=Arlington National Cemetery &gt; Funerals &gt; Scheduling a Funeral &gt; Headstones and Niche Covers &gt; Government Headstone/Niche Covers |quote=White marble niche covers (15¾ x 11¼ x ¼) generally contain 11 lines of text with or without  an optional emblem of belief.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the VA adds a new symbol a few months after receiving a petition from a faith group.&lt;ref name=Banerjee /&gt; However, the [[Wicca]]n symbol was only added in 2007 to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of several families by [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] in November 2006.&lt;ref name=Banerjee&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Neela|title=Use of Wiccan Symbol on Veterans’ Headstones Is Approved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/washington/24wiccan.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 24, 2007}} The VA added emblem of belief #37 – "WICCA (Pentacle)".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/veterans-affairs-department-must-accommodate-wiccan-symbol-on-memorial-markers|title=Veterans Affairs Department Must Accommodate Wiccan Symbol On Memorial Markers At Government Cemeteries, Says Americans United|publisher=AU|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart v. Nicholson|url=https://www.au.org/our-work/legal/lawsuits/stewart-v-nicholson|publisher=AU|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate parallel lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Wiccan churches and three families by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] in September 2006, which was resolved by the same settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Veterans Denied Right to Post Religious Symbol on Headstones, ACLU Charges|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/veterans-denied-right-post-religious-symbol-headstones-aclu-charges|date=September 29, 2006|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|title=Pagans Sue on Emblem for Graves|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/washington/30grave.html|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Veterans Win Right to Post Religious Symbol on Headstones|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/veterans-win-right-post-religious-symbol-headstones|date=April 23, 2007|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interfaith headstone, which includes a Wiccan [[pentacle]] for Jan Deanna O'Rourke and a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Cross]] for her husband, was installed at Arlington National Cemetery on May 1, 2007, and dedicated on July 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=Christopher|title=A First Dedication at Arlington|journal=Action|year=2007|url=http://aren.org/newsletter/2007-lammas/action.php?num=2|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headstone and marker symbols==
The following emblems and emblem numbers are publicized as available for Government headstones and markers as of September 2017.&lt;ref name="DVA"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Cemetery Administration |url=http://www.cem.va.gov/hmm/emblems.asp |title=Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers – National Cemetery Administration |publisher=Cem.va.gov |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process is in place to consider approving additional religious or belief system emblems requested by the families of individuals eligible for these headstones and markers.&lt;ref name="DVA" /&gt;

Each emblem is given its official USVA name and designation, with added additional links for related symbolism (*) and for related movements (†).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23150">Radio and club DJ [[Gilles Peterson]] every three months or so does an ''All Winners Special'' in which he replays the previous few months' best new [[track (song)|tracks]]—both [[single (music)|singles]]/individual [[album]] tracks as well as whole albums—he has either played out when [[DJing]] or played on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show ''[[Gilles Peterson#Radio 1|Worldwide]]''. At the end of the year, these winners, plus a few further favourites that may have been overlooked, get compiled into a [[longlist]]. Listeners of the show then get to vote this longlist down to a shortlist of ten '''''Worldwide Winners''''' in each section, via the Radio 1 website, which Gilles then plays over the last couple of editions of his [[radioshow]] at the end of the year. It has been compiled in various forms at the end of every year since 1998 to present, though the first few years did not involve any public vote.

In recent years, from 2004 onwards, this has been expanded into the '''''Worldwide Winners Awards''''' with an event held at a London club venue during the very end of December or beginning of January, with outside broadcast recording by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], edited highlights of which are broadcast on a further one or two editions of the radio show at the start of January. 
Also further sections were added, like "Best Clubnight", "Best Recordshop", "Best Compilation Album", and a special award called "The [[John Peel]] ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Play More Jazz'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' Award" (a tribute to his Radio 1 colleague who died suddenly in 2004) given to an artist, often a newcomer, who has displayed special noteworthy work over the year.
