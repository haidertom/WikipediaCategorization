      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9541">The '''American Negro Theater''' (ANT) was formed in [[Harlem]] on June 5, 1940, by writer [[Abram Hill]] and actor [[Frederick O'Neal]]. The group was founded by the influence of the purposes of the Negro Unit of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in Harlem. It produced 19 plays before closing in 1949. Designed as a community theater group, performances were held in Harlem's [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]].  In 1942, ANT began its Studio Theatre training program for beginning actors.  Graduates include [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Harry Belafonte]].

== History ==
Hill and O'Neal started the ANT by assembling several of their own theatre friends: [[Howard Augusta]], James Jackson, [[Virgil Richardson]], [[Claire Leyba]], [[Jefferson D. Davis]], [[Vivian Hall]], [[Austin Briggs-Hall]], [[Stanley Green]], [[Fanny McConnell]], and [[Kenneth Manigault]]. Collectively, they started the group with just 11 cents. In the beginning, Hill spent his time mailing out postcards to invite as many people as he could to meetings and within just a few weeks, the group grew to thirty people.

Hill approached librarians at the public library on 135th Street in Harlem, the Harlem Branch of the [[New York Public Library]], to start producing his plays. The librarians granted Hill and the ANT permission to use their basement stage. The basement theatre held 150 seats and Hill charged 49 cents a seat. The first show they produced, "Hits, Bits, and Skits," opened on July 17, 1940. The first major play that the ANT put into rehearsal was "On Strivers' Row" which Hill put into rehearsal after it had done so well with the [[Rose McClendon Players]] who also held performances in Harlem. "On Strivers' Row" ran for five months and in March 1941, Hill moved it to the [[Apollo Theatre]] as a musical with the lyrics of [[Don Burley]], the music of [[J.P. Johnson]], and the choreography of [[Leonard Harper]]. It ran at the [[Apollo Theatre]] for one week.

In 1944, the ANT applied to the General Education Board of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for a financial grant. The proposal they submitted asked for salaries to be paid to the company's officers. It also informed the Board on the following objectives of the ANT:

* 1) To Develop an Art
* 2) To Develop a Vital Theatre
* 3) To Develop Pride and Honor

The proposal resulted in a $22,000 grant-in-aid for the ANT. These objectives were also printed on programs for ANT productions.

Its most successful production, ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'', fundamentally transformed the ANT.  A white author, [[Phillip Yordan]], wrote the play about a Polish family in Pennsylvania whose daughter is a waterfront prostitute, but could not find a company to perform it. So he rewrote it to feature a black family.  It was performed by the ANT in 1944.  According to a notice in The Brooklyn Eagle on March 30, 1944, the sets for that initial production were designed by the American realist painter [[Michael Lenson]], but that has not been verified. Five weeks later the play opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Nine New York newspaper dailies reviewed the show. They all raved and producers instantly starting fighting over who would get the rights to the play.  Yordan agreed to sign a Dramatists Guild contract that would make Hill the coauthor of ''[[AnnaLucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]''. This gave Hill a five percent author's royalty.

The ANT itself received few royalties for ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'' and the next three ANT plays to appear on Broadway were not successful.  Despite this, following the success of ''[[Anna Lucasta (play)|Anna Lucasta]]'' the ANT became less community-centered.  From then on, the ANT only featured plays from established white playwrights, and young actors viewed the ANT as a means to break into Broadway productions.

== Goals ==
The ANT had four goals that they were governed by:
*1) To develop a permanent acting company trained in the arts and crafts of the theatre that also reflected the special gifts, talents, and attributes of African Americans.
*2) To produce plays that honestly and with integrity interpreted, illuminated, and criticized contemporary black life and the concerns of the black people.
*3) To maintain an affiliation with, and provide leadership for, other black theatre groups throughout the nation.
*4) To utilize its resources to develop racial pride in the theatre, rather than racial apathy.

== Constitution ==
When the ANT was first founded in 1940, the group created a 30-page constitution for themselves that reflected the ideals of the Federal Theater Project. The constitution also drew upon [[W.E.B. Du Bois]]'s belief that African-American theatre should be by, about, for, and near African-Americans.

The following is an excerpt from the constitution:

"A People's theatre is a very valuable institution. it provides the finest outlet for class emotions that can be organized. It serves as a spur to citizen ambition provides a partly self-supporting source of work and income, and a healthy kind of occupational therapy on a national scale for thousands.

Unhappily, we have been trained to think of the theatre mostly in terms of commercial enterprise that is too expensive when it is worthy, and too cheap and boring when it is not. We know it too frequently as an investment for gambling show men, or as a playground for dilettantes and escapists who are unable to withstand the hard realities of life.
We need a people's theatre which shall in effect be a national theatre. The people who want a theatre will have to organize it and pay a part of the expense for both its creation and support. Realizing the reluctance of the people to assume this responsibility, the essential burden of stimulating the development of such a project rests upon the shoulders of those individuals who are willing to assume this obligation, those who feel sincerely the call in a genuine quest for the content of theatre art, and by their talent, industry, and profound respect for a theatre they shall create."

(American Negro Theater Constitution, 1940)

== Notes ==
* The acronym ANT was popular as it was viewed as a metaphor for how hardworking and community-driven the group was.
*In a 1996 interview with [[Cornel West]], [[Harry Belafonte]] described how the American Negro Theater really opened his eyes to how "magical" theatre was. Belafonte said that he saw his first show in the ANT when he was given two tickets as a gratuity when he was working as a janitor's assistant for [[Clarice Taylor]], who was in the play that night.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2887">The '''Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts''' (also known as "The Bray") is a public, [[nonprofit]], educational institution located 3 miles from downtown [[Helena, Montana]], United States.

It was founded on the site of the former Western Clay Manufacturing Company in 1951 by brickmaker Archie Bray, a philanthropist and avid patron of the arts. Bray intended it to be "a place to make available for all who are seriously and sincerely interested in any of the branches of the ceramic arts, a fine place to work."

Although Bray died in 1953, his foundation survived the 1960 closure of Western Clay and in 1984 purchased the abandoned brickyard building and kilns. Today the '''Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts''' is internationally acclaimed&lt;ref&gt;Aarstad, Rich, Ellie Arguimbau, Ellen Baumler, Charlene Porsild, and Brian Shovers.

Montana Historical Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and listed on the American [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The [[artist residency]] program is the core of the foundation.   [[Rudy Autio]], and [[Peter Voulkos]], were the first resident artists in 1951.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Spirit 24-25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newby|first1=Rick|last2=Jiusto|first2=Chere|title='A Beautiful Spirit': Origins of the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts|journal=Montana The Magazine of Western History|date=Summer 2001|volume=51|issue=2|pages=24–25|jstor=4520322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their professor at [[Montana State College]], [[Frances Senska]], friends with Bray, encouraged them to take advantage of his clay studio.  To pay their way, they worked in the brick factory during the day and created their own pottery in the evenings.  They built the first building for their new residency program in the summer of '51.&lt;ref name="Beautiful Spirit 24-25" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5928">Works of '''bamboo painting''', usually in ink, are a recognized [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] or subgenre of [[East Asia]]n painting. In a work of bamboo painting in ink, a skilled artist and [[calligraphy#East Asian calligraphy|calligrapher]] will paint a [[bamboo]] stalk or group of stalks with leaves. The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the foreground and background, and between the varying [[wikt:texture|textures]] represented by the stalks and the leaves, gave scope to the painter to demonstrate his or her mastery with an inkpot and a brush.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/large88.html |title=Ink Bamboo |work=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2009-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo painter often inscribes a [[poem]] that accompanies the painting and further elucidates the motif. The poem is often an integral part of the work as a whole. A viewer of the work can compare the calligraphy of the poem with the calligraphy of the painting, as both are typically inscribed with the same brush and reflect a similar mood and state of awareness.  

A standard primer on classical East Asian bamboo painting is [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" (1633).  Because of the volume of bamboo works painted over time, the production of a work of ink bamboo became one of the standard subjects to which an East Asian student could be set in a competitive [[Imperial examination|examination]].&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt;

==Appreciation==
From the days of their common origin, Chinese painting and Chinese writing have been allied arts. They use the same equipment and share aims, techniques, and standards. Ever since the beginning, bamboo has been written and also been painted in the same manner, in other words, a work depicting bamboo is both a painting and a piece of calligraphy. There are so-called “bamboo painters” who all their lives paint only bamboo.  The bamboo is strong, upright, and dependable. He may bend with the wind, the storm and the rain, but he never breaks. He is a true gentleman of courage and endurance (Ju 1989). 

{{blockquote|The first principle of bamboo composition is, the four parts of the plant should be considered in the following order: stem, knot, branches and leaves. If the basic rule is not followed, time and effort will be wasted and the picture will never be completed.” This is the beginning of the early Book of Bamboo, a part of the Mustard Seed Garden manual of painting which was prepared and published by Chinese master in the year 1701 A.D. No bamboo painting is a photographic copy of some bamboo at some particular place, seen from a particular angle; instead it is a suggestion of the true essence of the bamboo, an expression of the qualities of a true Chinese gentleman, whom the bamboo symbolizes (Ju 1989).}}

[[Image:Wen Tong Babmbuk.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Example of ink bamboo painting by [[Wen Tong]], c. 1060.]]
The [[bamboo]] plant came under close observation by many Asians because of its persistence and vegetative productivity. The plant was especially appreciated by men and women educated in the tradition of [[Confucius]]. It came to be seen as an exemplar of [[De (Chinese)|moral force]], and appreciating the bamboo was seen as an act of [[Chun Tzu|self-cultivation]]. It was said of the ink bamboo painter [[Wen Tong]] that "there are whole bamboos in his heart" (胸有成竹).

[[Bamboo]] is not exclusive to the '''[[Four Gentlemen|Four Noble Kind]]''' group. It also belongs to a distinct group where it openly fraternizes with [[pine trees]] and [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]]. Collectively, they are called the '''[[Three Friends of Winter]]''' because [[bamboo]] and [[pine]] do not wither on winter days and the plum blossoms starts blooming during the cold season. 

Bamboo also exhibits a certain visual appeal on educated people because its [[silhouette]] cast by either the sun or moon on the paper windows of a Chinese house produced a poetic effect. Its straight stalk was the symbol of the sage, in that adversity could always bend it but it could never break it. The inner region of the bamboo stalk symbolizes the void that must be established in one's mind before thinking of useful ideas. To put it in simpler terms, one should always have clarity of mind when dealing with things to avoid chaos and to achieve desired results.

On the technical area, one needed to be an expert with the brush in order to execute perfectly cylindrical, smooth and hard [[internodes]], and thin, translucid, nervous leaves placed in various perspectives. One should also have a keen talent in identifying where to place dark [[Lightness (color)|tones]] and light tones in the painting. 

These characteristics are enough to validate that bamboo is a complete subject because it portrays lasting values one needed to get on with life and it commands a truly talented painter to create varying tones that never repeat.

&lt;/ref&gt; Tilley is the author of a biography of the Australian performer [[Leigh Bowery]] titled ''Leigh Bowery, The Life and Times of an Icon''. Tilley was introduced to Freud by Bowery, who was already modelling for him. Freud painted a number of large portraits of her around the period 1994&amp;ndash;96, and came to call her "Big Sue". He said of her body "It's flesh without muscle and it has developed a different kind of texture through bearing such a weight-bearing thing".&lt;ref&gt;[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], Exhibition booklet for ''Lucian Freud Portraits'', 2012, Section VII&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''Bengal School of Art''' commonly referred as '''Bengal School''',&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt; was an [[art movement]] and a style of [[Indian painting]] that originated in [[Bengal]], primarily [[Kolkata]] and [[Shantiniketan]], and flourished throughout [[India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with [[Indian nationalism]] ([[swadeshi]]) and led by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], the principal of the [[Government College of Art, Kolkata]] from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the [[modern Indian painting]].&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt;&lt;ref name=benartmitter&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850-1922: occidental orientations |last=Mitter |first=Partha |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1994|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8 |chapter=How the past was salvaged by Swadeshi artists |pages=267–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benartatlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of world art |last=Onians |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |page= 304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havell]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=August 19, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by [[Mughal painting|Mughal art]], a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were [[Nandalal Bose]], M.A.R Chughtai, [[Sunayani Devi]] (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Asit Kumar Haldar]], [[Sudhir Khastgir]], Kshitindranath Majumdar, [[Sughra Rababi]], [[D. P. Roy Choudhury|Debi Prasad Roychoudhury]], Bireswar Sen, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Kiron Sinha,TP [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (Tagore's brother) 
MeharThapar and [[Sarada Ukil]].&lt;ref name=ngma&gt;{{cite web |title=Showcase - Bengal School |url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-bengal.asp |date= |publisher=[[National Gallery of Modern Art]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. {{As of|2012}}, there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.&lt;ref name=benarttoi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-12/special-report/31051756_1_bengal-school-bengal-art-bengal-masters| title=For many art lovers, it's back to the old school| last=Ghose | first=Archana Khare |newspaper=Times of India| location=New Delhi|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
However, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art &amp; Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan &amp; Ratan Acharya. 
Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are [[Jogen Chowdhury]], [[Mrinal Kanti Das]], [[Gopal Sanyal]], [[Ganesh Pyne]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], Ganesh Haloi &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=The Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Samir Aich, [[Bikash Bhattacharjee]], Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and  [[Devajyoti Ray]].
Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.

==R. Siva Kumar's disagreement ==
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[R. Siva Kumar]], who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the '''Bengal School of Art'''. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]].

'''Big Mouth Billy Bass''' is an [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] singing [[Theatrical property|prop]], representing a [[largemouth bass]], invented on December 16, 1998, sold from January 1, 1999, and popular in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.betootaadvocate.com/breaking-news/report-big-mouth-billy-bass-still-good-laugh/ |title=Report: Big Mouth Billy Bass Still Good For A Laugh |date=2017-08-25 |website=The Betoota Advocate |language=en-US |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.business-management-degree.net/bizarre-inventions-that-made-serious-bucks/ |title=Bizarre Inventions that Made Serious Bucks |website=www.business-management-degree.net |language=en |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish is made of [[Latex|latex rubber]] with a plastic mechanical skeleton inside of it; at first glance, it appears to be a [[taxidermy|mounted]] [[game fish]]. The product was conceived by [[Gemmy Industries]] product development vice president Joe Pellettieri following a visit to a [[Bass Pro Shops|Bass Pro Shop]].&lt;ref name=sobey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobey|first1=Ed|last2=Sobey|first2=Woody|title=The Way Toys Work: The Science Behind the Magic 8 Ball, Etch a Sketch, Boomerang, and More|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2ApK7QnbPUC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2008|publisher=Chicago Review|isbn=9781613743096|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device turns its head towards a person, facing them, and then wiggles its tail on its trophy plaque and sings [[kitsch]]y cover songs, such as "[[Don't Worry, Be Happy]]" by [[Bobby McFerrin]] and "[[Take Me To The River]]" by [[Al Green]], who said he received more royalties from it than from any other recording of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehawkyakima.com/GUY-TURNS-HIS-BIG-MOUTH-BILLY-BASS-INTO-AN-ALEXA-/19871535?pid=534663 |title=GUY TURNS HIS BIG MOUTH BILLY BASS INTO AN ALEXA! |website=105.7 The Hawk |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singing mechanism was originally activated by a motion sensor and intended to startle a passerby. Eventually, a button was added to activate it. In addition, many variants of Big Mouth Billy Bass were also produced by Gemmy using different types of game fish and other aquatic animals, with some of them being Travis the [[rainbow trout|Rainbow Trout]], Cool [[Catfish]], and Rocky [[Lobster]]. The concept was even later adapted into a large mounted [[white-tailed deer|deer]] head, known as Buck the Animated Trophy, which is voiced by actor [[Clint Ford]], and a medium-sized mounted [[bear]] head.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;Schuessler, Heidi, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EEDC113FF937A25751C1A9669C8B63&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=big+mouth+billy+bass&amp;st=nyt Getting Under the Skin of a Fish That Can Get Under Yours], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 14, 2000, last accessed May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of art in the geographic area now known as [[Brazil]] begins with the earliest records of its human habitation. The original inhabitants of the land, [[pre-Columbian]] Indian peoples, produced various forms of art; specific cultures like the [[Marajoara]] left sophisticated painted [[pottery]]. This area was colonized by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century and given the modern name of [[Brazil]]. '''Brazilian art''' is most commonly used as an umbrella term for art created in this region post Portuguese colonization.

==Pre-Columbian traditions==
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
The oldest known art in Brazil is the [[cave painting]]s in [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] in the state of [[Piauí]],&lt;ref&gt;''Almanaque Abril 2007''. São Paulo: Editora Abril, 2007, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to c. 13,000 BC. More recent examples have been found in [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goiás]], showing geometric patterns and animal forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html Martins, Simone B. &amp; Imbroisi, Margaret H. ''História da Arte'', 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031010548/http://historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most sophisticated kinds of Pre-Columbian artifact found in Brazil is the sophisticated [[Marajoara]] pottery (c.  800–1400 AD), from cultures flourishing on [[Marajó Island]] and around the region of [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]], decorated with painting and complex human and animal reliefs. Statuettes and cult objects, such as the small carved-stone amulets called [[muiraquitã]]s, also belong to these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Correa, Conceição Gentil. ''Estatuetas de cerâmica na cultura Santarém''. Belém: Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mina culture|Mina]] and [[Periperi]] cultures, from [[Maranhão]] and [[Bahia]], produced interesting though simpler pottery and statuettes.

In the beginning of the 21st century, the ancient Indian traditions of [[body painting]], pottery, cult statuettes, and feather art are still being cultivated by the remaining Indian peoples.

==Baroque==
{{main|Baroque in Brazil}}
The first Western artists active in Brazil were [[Roman Catholic]] priests who came from Portugal to “civilize” the Indians. [[Jesuit]]s assumed an important role in this process, with their many missionary establishments called "[[Reductions]]" teaching religion through art in the form of sacred plays, music, statuary, and painting. [[José de Anchieta]] was the first important playwright; [[Agostinho de Jesus]] and [[Agostinho da Piedade]] produced the first known sculptures; [[Belchior Paulo]], [[João Felipe Bettendorff]], [[Ricardo do Pilar]], and a few others did the first paintings; while [[Francisco de Vaccas]] and Pedro da Fonseca started organizing the musical life of the infant colony. [[Basílio da Gama]] and [[Gregório de Mattos]] were the first secular poets. All of them worked under the influence of the [[Baroque]], the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;KARNAL, Leandro.

Encyclopaedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 17th and 18th centuries Baroque art flourished with increasing richness and craftsmanship, mainly in [[Bahia]] and [[Pernambuco]] along the coast and in some inland regions, reaching the highest levels of originality in [[Minas Gerais]], where a [[gold rush]] nurtured a rich and cultured local society. In Minas lived the greatest artists of Brazilian Baroque: [[Painting|painter]] [[Manuel da Costa Ataíde]] and [[sculptor]]-[[architect]] [[Aleijadinho]]. Minas was also the birthplace of a proto-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school of [[music]] and [[literature]], with composers [[Lobo de Mesquita]] and [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], and poets [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] and [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]].&lt;ref name="itaucultural.org.br" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MARIZ, Vasco.

==19th century: Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism==
{{See also|Academic art in Brazil}}
One single event in the 19th century sowed the seeds for a complete renewal in Brazilian visual arts: the arrival of the [[Missão Artística Francesa|French Artistic Mission]] in 1816, which strongly reinforced the Neoclassical style, previously seen in Brazil only in timid attempts. [[Joachim Lebreton]], its leader, proposed the creation of an Academy of Fine Arts, later restructured as the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Brazil)|Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]]. The Academy was the most important center for the [[visual arts]] through nearly the whole of the 19th century. It imposed a new concept of artistic education and was the basis for a revolution in Brazilian painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;CONDURU, Roberto. ''Araras Gregas''. In: 19&amp;20 - A revista eletrônica de DezenoveVinte. Volume III, n. 2, abril de 2008 [http://www.dezenovevinte.net/arte%20decorativa/ad_conduru.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A few decades later, under the personal patronage of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who was engaged in an ambitious national project of modernization, the Academy reached its golden age, fostering the emergence of the first generation of Romantic painters. [[Victor Meirelles]] and [[Pedro Américo]], among others, produced lasting visual symbols of national identity. It must be said that in Brazil Romanticism in painting took a peculiar shape, not showing the overwhelming dramaticism, fantasy, violence, or interest in death and the bizarre commonly seen in the European version, and because of its academic and palatial nature all excesses were eschewed.&lt;ref&gt;BISCARDI, Afrânio &amp; ROCHA, Frederico Almeida. ''O Mecenato Artístico de D. Pedro II e o Projeto Imperial''. In: 19&amp;20 - A revista eletrônica de DezenoveVinte.

[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedro Américo: ''[[Independence or Death (painting)|Independence or Death!]]'', 1888. [[Museu Paulista]]]]

Meanwhile, literature too evolved towards a romantic-nationalist school with the works of [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]. Around 1850, a transition began, centered upon [[Álvares de Azevedo]], who was influenced by the poetry of [[Lord Byron]]. This second generation of Romantics was obsessed with morbidness and death, and soon after, social commentary could be found in literature, both features not seen in the visual arts. [[Antônio Castro Alves]] wrote of the horrors of [[slavery]], and the persecuted Indians were rescued through art by poets and novelists like [[Antônio Gonçalves Dias]] and [[José de Alencar]]. These trends combined in one of the most important accomplishments of the Romantic era in Brazil: the establishment of a Brazilian national identity based on Indian ancestry and the rich natural environment of the country.&lt;ref&gt;''O Indianismo como Projeto de Nacionalidade''. Secretaria Municipal de Educação - Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro [http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/tema65_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the 19th century produced only two composers of outstanding talent: neoclassical sacred composer [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]], for a while [[music director]] to the court, and later, Romantic [[Opera|operist]] [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]], the first Brazilian musician to win international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''A Música na Corte de D. João VI e D. Pedro I; Antonio Carlos Gomes''. In MARIZ, Vasco. ''História da Música no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005.pp 52-61; 76-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, Brazilian art became acquainted with [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Descriptions of nature and of the people of Brazil's varied regions as well as psychological romances proliferated with [[João Simões Lopes Neto]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Euclides da Cunha]], and, above all, [[Machado de Assis]], while [[Almeida Junior]], [[Pedro Weingärtner]], [[Oscar Pereira da Silva]], and other Realist painters depicted folk types and the distinctive colors and light of Brazilian landscape.

==20th century: Modern Art==

The beginning of the 20th century saw a struggle between old schools and modernist trends. The [[Week of Modern Art]] festival, held in [[São Paulo]] in 1922, was received with fiery criticism by conservative  sectors of the society, but it was a landmark in the history of Brazilian art. It included plastic arts exhibitions, lectures, concerts, and the reading of poems. Due to the radicalism (for the times) of some of their poems and music, the artists were vigorously booed and pelted by the audience, and the press and art critics in general were strong in their condemnation. However, those artists are now seen as the founders of Modern art in Brazil. Modernist literature and theory of art were represented by [[Oswald de Andrade]], [[Sérgio Milliet]], [[Menotti del Picchia]], and [[Mário de Andrade]], whose revolutionary novel ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]'' (1928) is one of the founding texts of Brazilian Modernism. Painting was represented by [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti]], [[Lasar Segall]], [[Vicente do Rego Monteiro]]; sculpture by [[Victor Brecheret]]; and music by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], the leader of a new musical nationalism, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ ''Semana da Arte Moderna''. Pitoresco Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414025546/http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|250px|Oscar Niemeyer: [[Cathedral of Brasília]]. The statues are works by [[Alfredo Ceschiatti]]]]
The Week not only introduced to a wider public modern, experimental tendencies derived from European [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]], but also wanted to make use of national [[folklore]] as a basis for an art more relevant to the Brazilian reality, with an enhanced social awareness. This "cannibalization" of european movements and transformation into genuine brazilian expression is the motto between the [[Manifesto Antropófago|Anthropophagic Manifesto]], published by Oswald de Andrade in 1928, that draws parallels between art history and the cannibal rituals of the Tupi people.

However, the radicalism of those first Modernists couldn't last for long in a society used to traditional fashions, and the original core members had separated by 1929, pursuing individual paths. What Brazilian art then became was a mix of some important achievements of the Moderns, meaning freedom from the strict academic agenda, with more conventional traits, giving birth in the following generation to a moderate Modernism, best exemplified by painter [[Cândido Portinari]], who was something like the official painter of the Brazilian government in mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=termos_texto_ing&amp;cd_verbete=4900&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=8 ''Modernism in Brazil''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Copan ST.jpg|thumb|181x181px|left|''Oscar Niemeyer: ''Copan Building'']]

Within the group of Brazilian artists, Chico Niedzielski's artwork has been spread all over the country. His work is known to be inspired by Sacred Geometry, breaking the tendency to focus on Brazilian themes and searching for a more universal and atemporal form of [http://chiconiedzielski.com Brazilian art].
The erosion of radical Modernism in the visual arts in the early 20th century was not reflected in Brazilian literature. [[Clarice Lispector]] wrote [[Existentialism|existentialist]] novels and developed a highly personal style, filled with [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] and epiphanies. [[João Guimarães Rosa]] changed the face of Brazilian literature with his experimental language, and playwright [[Nelson Rodrigues]] dealt with crime, prejudice, passion, and sexual pathologies. In the 1950s, painting and sculpture regained strength through [[Abstractionism]], and architecture began also to display advanced features, influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]. Its greatest achievement was the urban core of [[Brasília]], designed by urbanist [[Lúcio Costa]] and architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], now a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=artistas_biografia_ing&amp;cd_verbete=3948&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=1 ''Niemeyer, Oscar''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 1960s onwards: Contemporary Art ==
Around the 1960s, the so-called "modernist" art movements started giving way to most contemporary means of expression, such as appropriation, political art, [[Conceptual art]] and [[Pop art|Pop]]. Right at the turn of the decade, some Brazilian [[Concrete art|Concrete]] artists began ditching the traditional "strictness" of concrete art in favor of a more phenomenological approach, exploring the relations between the art object and the viewer. Among the primary leaders of this [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete movement]] were the poet [[Ferreira Gullar]], and the visual artists [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Pape]] and [[Lygia Clark]], this last one internationally cited as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/most-influential-artists-1093196|title=Who Are the Most Influential Artists of the Last Century? 26 Industry Leaders Weigh In {{!}} artnet News|date=2017-10-13|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|Coup d'état of 1964]] and subsequential takeaway of civil rights and freedom of expression in Brazil is commonly marked as the shifting point, whence artists such as [[Cildo Meireles]] and [[Rubens Gerchman]] began creating explicitly political art &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/artes-plasticas/index.html|title=Artes plásticas na ditadura - Memórias da ditadura|date=2014-11-14|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Particularly after 1968, when the military government legalized torture, brazilian art was marked by rather radical actions and [[Happening|happenings]]. The [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], the second oldest art biennial in the world, opened up with most of its walls empty due to a boycott from the artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bienal.org.br/post.php?i=537|title=O boicote à Bienal de 1969 - Bienal|last=Paulo|first=Bienal São|website=www.bienal.org.br|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In 1970, the exhibit Do Corpo à Terra ("From Body to Earth") took place in [[Belo Horizonte]], and included rather shocking actions such as Cildo Meireles setting live chickens on fire in front of a live audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/obras/tiradentes-totem-monumento-ao-preso-politico-1970-de-cildo-meireles/index.html|title=Tiradentes – Totem-monumento ao Preso Político (1970), de Cildo Meireles - Memórias da ditadura|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Artur Barrio]] ditching blood-soaked packages in a river, giving off the impression that the people who disappeared under the military government had "reappeared" in this gruesome fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53099013|title=Inverted utopias : avant-garde art in Latin America|last=1955-|first=Ramírez, Mari Carmen,|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Olea, Héctor., Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.|isbn=0300102690|location=New Haven|oclc=53099013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brazilian [[Pop art]] didn't come without its share of criticism, sometimes adopting an outright rejection of consumer culture instead of the ambivalent, distant criticism of american pop. [[Waldemar Cordeiro]] is one of the most expressive artists that began exploring digital art and robotics in its work around the 60s and 70s, while Antonio Dias, Carlos Vergara brought the aethetics of comic books, playing cards and other popular forms of visuality into his work. Hélio Oiticica's "Tropicália", a colorful immersive installation piece, incorporated references to the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The title relates to the [[Tropicália|cultural movement of the same name]], that called back to the Antropophagic Manifesto of the 1920s to offer a more tongue-in-cheek perspective on the myths of an exotic and "wild" Brazil.

Some artists as: [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Naza (artist)|Naza]], [[Cildo Meireles]] among others, have been featured on the international stage. Brazilian contemporary art and photography are among the most creative in Latin America, growing an international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Names like Miguel Rio Branco, [[Vik Muniz]], [[Sebastião Salgado]], [[Guy Veloso]], and others, get strong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1711">'''Cadac-Andreas''', Irish scholar, fl. 798 &amp;ndash; 814.

Cadac-Andreas was an Irish scholar at the court of [[Charlemange]] who roused the ire of Bishop [[Theodulphus]] for lengthy and pedantic approach to [[exegesis]], which he apparently delighted in. A nameless court poet, possibly connected to Theodulphus, wrote further of him, scorning and parodying

* his fascination with etymologies in the three sacred languages
* pondering who was the first person to perform something in the [[Bible]]
* pedantic, long-winded, interest in terminology

Theodulphus grew to detest Cadac-Andreas so much that he strongly urged Charlemagne to have him dismissed from court. Yet much to the frustration of Theodulphus, and no doubt others at court, Cadac was subsequently awarded a bishopric by the king.

Theodulphus, on the other hand, was later sent into exile by [[Louis the Pious]].

{{Culture of Canada}}
'''Canadian art''' refers to the [[visual arts|visual]] (including [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[printmaking]]) as well as [[plastic arts]] (such as [[sculpture]]) originating from the geographical area of contemporary [[Canada]]. Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|First Nations Peoples]] followed by waves of immigration which included artists of European origins and subsequently by artists with heritage from countries all around the world. The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.

The [[Government of Canada]] has, at times, played a central role in the development of Canadian culture, enabling visual exposure through publications and periodicals, as well as establishing and funding numerous art schools and colleges across the country. The [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] is often considered the first uniquely Canadian artistic group and style of painting;&lt;ref name="Jessup2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynda Jessup|title=Antimodernism and artistic experience: policing the boundaries of modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81bt2ujVwnwC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8354-8|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this claim is challenged by some scholars and artists.&lt;ref&gt;
The essay collection ''Sightlines: Reading Contemporary Canadian Art'' (edited by Jessica Bradley and Lesley Johnstone, Montreal: Artexte Information Centre, 1994) contains a number of critical texts addressing the issues around the difficulty of establishing or even defining a Canadian identity.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the [[Catholic Church]] was the primary patron of art in early Canada, especially Quebec, and in later times artists have combined British, French and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles and at other times working to promote [[Canadian nationalism|nationalism]] by developing distinctly Canadian styles. Canadian art remains the combination of these various influences.

==Aboriginal art==
{{main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
[[File:Totem haida.jpg|left|thumb|[[Haida people|Haida]] totem pole, Thunderbird Park, British Columbia]]
[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] were producing art in the territory that is now called Canada for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples that produced them, Indigenous art traditions spanned territories that extended across the current national boundaries between Canada and the United States. Indigenous art traditions are often organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups, the most common regional distinctions being: [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]],  [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]], [[Plains Indians|Plains]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Eastern Woodlands]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic|Subarctic]], and [[Inuit|Arctic]]. As might be expected, art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. One thing that distinguishes Indigenous art from European traditions is a focus on art that tends to be portable and made for the body rather than for architecture, although even this is only a general tendency and not an absolute rule. Indigenous visual art is also often made to be used in conjunction with other arts, for example masks and rattles play an important role in ceremonialism that also involves dance, storytelling and music.

Many of the artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads. The distinct [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis cultures]] that have arisen from inter-cultural relationships with Europeans have also contributed new culturally hybrid art forms. During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, the Canadian government pursued an active policy of assimilation toward Indigenous peoples. One of the instruments of this policy was the [[Indian Act]], which banned manifestations of traditional religion and governance, such as the [[Sun Dance]] and the [[Potlatch]], including the works of art associated with them. It was not until the 1950s and 60s that Indigenous artists such as [[Mungo Martin]], [[Bill Reid]] and [[Norval Morrisseau]] began to publicly renew and, in some cases, re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are many Indigenous artists practising in all media in Canada and two Indigenous artists, such as [[Edward Poitras]] and [[Rebecca Belmore]], who have represented Canada at the prestigious [[Venice Biennale]] in 1995 and 2005, respectively.

==French colonial period (1665–1759)==

[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain in 1612.]]

Early explorers such as [[Samuel de Champlain]] made sketches of North American territory as they explored, but it was the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in and around [[Quebec City]] who was the first to provide artistic patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbé Hughes Pommier is believed to be the first painter in [[New France]]. Pommier left France in 1664 and worked in various communities as a priest before taking up painting extensively. Painters in New France, such as Pommier and Claude Francois (known primarily as [[Frère Luc]]), believed in the ideals of [[High Renaissance]] art, which featured religious depictions often formally composed with seemingly classical clothing and settings.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Few artists during this early period signed their works, making attributions today difficult.

Near the end of the 17th century, the population of New France was growing steadily but the territory was increasingly isolated from France. Fewer artists arrived from Europe, but artists in New France continued with commissions from the Church. Two schools were established in New France to teach the arts and there were a number of artists working throughout New France up until the British Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Le Ber]], from a wealthy Montreal family, is one of the most recognized artists from this period. Believed to be self-taught since he never left New France, Le Ber's work is widely admired. In particular, his depiction of the saint [[Marguerite Bourgeoys]] was hailed as "the single most moving image to survive from the French period" by Canadian art historian [[Dennis Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

While early religious painting told little about everyday life, numerous [[ex-voto]]s completed by amateur artists offered vivid impressions of life in New France. Ex-votos, or votive painting, were made as a way to thank God or the saints for answering a prayer. One of the best known examples of this type of work is ''Ex-voto des trois naufragés de Lévis'' (1754). Five youths were crossing the [[Saint Lawrence River]] at night when their boat overturned in rough water. Two girls drowned, weighed down by their heavy dresses, while two young men and one woman were able to hold on to the overturned boat until help arrived. [[Saint Anne]] is depicted in the sky, saving them. This work was donated to the church at [[Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]] as an offering of thanks for the three lives saved.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early art in British North America===

The early ports of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland did not experience the same degree of artistic growth, largely due to their Protestant beliefs in simple church decoration which did not encourage artists or sculptors. However itinerant artists, painters who travelled to various communities to sell works, frequented the area. Dutch-born artist [[Gerard Edema]] is believed to have painted the first Newfoundland landscape in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Colonial period (1759–1867)==

[[File:A View of Montreal in Canada - Thomas Davies.jpg|thumb|right|''A View of Montreal in Canada, Taken from Isle St. Helena in 1762''&lt;br/&gt; by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]]]]

===British Army topographers===

The battle for Quebec left numerous British soldiers garrisoned in strategic locations in the territory. While off-duty, many of these soldiers sketched and painted the Canadian land and people, which were often sold in European markets hungry for exotic, [[picturesque]] views of the colonies. Furthermore, drawing was also required by soldiers to record the land, as photography had not been invented.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]] is championed as one of the most talented. Davies recorded the capture of [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisburg]] and [[Montreal]] among other scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scottish-born [[George Heriot (artist)|George Heriot]] was one of the first artist-soldiers to settle in Canada and later produced ''Travels Through the Canadas'' in 1807 filled with his [[aquatint]] prints.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Forshaw Day]] worked as a draftsman at Her Majesty's Naval Yard from 1862–79 in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] then moved to [[Kingston, Ontario]] to teach drawing at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] from 1879–97.

===Lower Canada's Golden Age===

In the late 18th century, art in Lower Canada began to prosper due to a larger number of commissions from the public and Church construction. Portrait painting in particular is recognized from this period, as it allowed a higher degree of innovation and change. [[François Baillairgé]] was one of the first of this generation of artists. He returned to Montreal in 1781 after studying sculpture in London and Paris.  The [[Rococo]] style influenced several Lower Canadian artists who aimed for the style's light and carefree painting. However, Baillairgé did not embrace Rococo, instead focusing on sculpture and teaching influenced from [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 56-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower Canada's artists evolved independently from France as the connection was severed during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. While not living in Lower Canada, [[William Berczy]] participated in the period's artistic growth. He immigrated to Canada from [[Saxony]] and completed several important portraits of leading figures. For example, he painted three portraits of [[Joseph Brant]] and his best known work is ''The Woolsley Family,'' painted in Quebec City in 1808–09. As the title suggests, the work features full-length portraits of all the members of the Woolsley family. It is celebrated in part because of its complex arrangement of figures, decorative floor panels, and the detailed view of the landscape through the open window.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[J. Russell Harper]] believes this era of Canadian art was the first to develop a truly Canadian character.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second generation of artists continued this flourishing of artistic growth beginning around the 1820s. [[Joseph Légaré]] was trained as a decorative and copy painter. However, this did not inhibit his artistic creativity as he was one of the first Canadian artists to depict the local landscape.  Légaré is best known for his depictions of disasters such as cholera plagues, rocks slides, and fires.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Plamondon]], A student of Légaré, went on to study in France, the first French Canadian artist to do so in 48 years. Plamondon went on to become the most successful artist in this period, largely through religious and portrait commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krieghoff and Kane===
[[File:Indian Wigwam in Lower Canada (1848 ) Cornelius Krieghoff.jpg|right|thumb|Cornelius Krieghoff, ''Indian Wigwam in Lower Canada'', [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
The works of most early Canadian painters were heavily influenced by European trends. During the mid-19th century, [[Cornelius Krieghoff]], a Dutch born artist in Quebec, painted scenes of the life of the ''habitants'' (French-Canadian farmers). At about the same time, the Canadian artist [[Paul Kane]] painted pictures of Indigenous life around the Great Lakes, Western Canada and the Oregon Territories.

==Art under the Dominion of Canada==

Formed in 1870 by a group of artists including [[John Bell-Smith]], father of [[Frederic Marlett Bell-Smith]] and [[Adolphe Vogt]], the [[Canadian Society of Artists]] was the first organization that reflected the new political boundaries and arguably a national identity. The group consisted of artists with diverse background, with many new Canadians and others of French heritage spread out over Ontario and Quebec. Without group philosophical or artistic objectives, most artists tended simply to please the public in order to produce income. [[Romanticism]] remained the predominant stylistic influence, with a growing appreciation for [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] originating from the [[Barbizon school]] practised by Canadians [[Homer Watson]] and [[Horatio Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 179–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==

===Nationalism and the Group of Seven===
{{main|Group of Seven (artists)|Canadian Group of Painters}}
[[File:Red Maple (A. Y. Jackson).jpg|right|thumb|''Red Maple'' by [[A.Y. Jackson]] from 1914]]
A group of [[landscape art|landscape]] painters called the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] aimed to develop the first distinctly Canadian style of painting. Some worked as commercial illustrators, notably at a Toronto company called Grip and were influenced by Europe's current popular [[Art Nouveau]] style. They painted various size studio paintings along with many small pieces while on location in the back country of Canada's then wilderness.

The group had its genesis at Toronto's Arts &amp; Letters Club before the first world war, though the war delayed their official formation. The eventual members were [[Franklin Carmichael]], [[Lawren Harris]], [[A. Y. Jackson]], [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]], [[Arthur Lismer]], [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], and [[Frederick Varley]].  Harris helped to fund many of the group's wilderness excursions by having custom box cars outfitted with sleeping quarters and heat, then left at prearranged train track locations to be shunted back when the group wanted to return. This was possible due to Harris' family fortune and influence as part of the Massey Harris Combine company which shipped most of their production by train. He later helped along with others to fund the construction of building for some of the group's use as studio space in Toronto.

[[Emily Carr]] and various other artists were loosely associated with the Group of Seven but never became members. [[Tom Thomson]] often referred to, but never officially a member, died in 1917 due to an accident on Canoe Lake in Northern Ontario. In the 1930s, members of the Group of Seven decided to enlarge the club and formed the [[Canadian Group of Painters]], made up of 28 artists from across the country.

===Beginning of non-objective art===

In the 1920s, [[Kathleen Munn]] and [[Bertram Brooker]] independently experimented with abstract or non-objective art in Canada. Both artists viewed abstract art as a way to explore [[symbol]]ism and [[mysticism]] as an integrated part of their personal spirituality. As the Group of Seven was enlarged into the Canadian group of Painters in the 1930s, [[Lawren Harris]] left the group's focus on depicting the Canadian landscape and experimented with abstract forms and aimed to represent broad conceptual themes. These individual artists indirectly influenced the following generation of artists who would come to form groups of abstract art following [[World War II]], by changing the definition of art in Canadian society and by encouraging young artists to explore abstract themes.&lt;ref&gt;Nasgaard, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporaries of the Group of Seven===
{{main|Eastern Group of Painters}}

Founded in 1938 in [[Montréal]], [[Québec]], the Eastern Group of Painters included Montréal artists whose common interest was painting and an [[art for art's sake]] aesthetic, not the espousal of a nationalist theory as was the case with the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] or the [[Canadian Group of Painters]]. The group's members included [[Alexander Bercovitch]], [[Goodridge Roberts]], [[Eric Goldberg (artist)|Eric Goldberg]], [[Jack Humphrey|Jack Weldon Humphrey]], [[John Goodwin Lyman]], and [[Jori Smith]].

By the late 1930s, many Canadian artists began resenting the quasi-national institution the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] had become. As a result of a growing rejection of the view that the efforts of a group of artists based largely in [[Ontario]] constituted a national vision or oeuvre, many artists—notably those in [[Québec]]—began feeling ignored and undermined. The Eastern Group of Painters formed to counter this notion and restore variation of purpose, method, and geography to [[Art in Canada|Canadian art]].

===1930s regionalism===

Since the 1930s, Canadian painters have developed a wide range of highly individual styles. [[Emily Carr]] became famous for her paintings of totem poles, native villages, and the forests of British Columbia. Other noted painters have included the landscape artist [[David Milne (artist)|David Milne]] and the prairie painter [[William Kurelek]]. In [[Quebec]], [[John Goodwin Lyman]] founded The Contemporary Arts Society in 1939, promoting post-impressionist and fauvist art.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;Terry Fenton, ''"ECAS And What It Stands For"'', ECAS 15th Annual Exhibition catalogue essay&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] spearheaded the modernist collective known as [[Les Automatistes]], which began having exhibitions as early as 1941. However, their artistic influence was not quickly felt in English Canada, or indeed much beyond [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Norwell, Iris. (2011), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgvrHdQ_iXEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Painters%20Eleven&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Painters Eleven:The Wild Ones of Canadian Art]'', Publishers Group West, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War II==

Government support has played a vital role in arts development, as has the establishment of numerous art schools and colleges across the country.

The abstract painters [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] and [[Harold Town]] and multi-media artist [[Michael Snow]]. The abstract art group [[Painters Eleven]], particularly the artists [[Alexandra Luke]], who is credited for the groups formation, and [[Jack Bush]], also had an important impact on modern art in Canada. The [[Painters Eleven]] (1953 - 1960) was founded in [[Toronto]] to promote their members' abstract works.

[[Regina Five]] is the name given to five abstract painters, [[Kenneth Lochhead]], [[Arthur McKay]], [[Douglas Morton]], [[Ted Godwin]], and [[Ronald Bloore]], who displayed their works in the 1961 [[National Gallery of Canada]]'s exhibition "Five Painters from Regina". Though not an organized group per se, the name stuck with the 'members' and the artists would continue to show together.&lt;ref name="Fenton" /&gt;

Canadian sculpture has been enriched by the walrus ivory and soapstone carvings by the [[Inuit art]]ists. These carvings show objects and activities from their daily lives, both modern and traditional, as well as scenes from [[Inuit mythology|their mythology]].

==Contemporary art==
[[File:TorontoEatonCentre.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Toronto [[Eaton Centre]] showing one of [[Michael Snow]]'s best known sculptures, titled ''Flightstop'', which depicts [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] in flight.]]

The 1960s saw the emergence of several important local developments in dialogue with international trends. In Vancouver, [[Ian Wallace (artist)]] was particularly influential in nurturing this dialogue through his teaching and exchange programs at [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] (formerly the Vancouver School of Art), and visits from influential figures such as [[Lucy Lippard]] and [[Robert Smithson]] exposed younger artists to [[conceptual art]].

In Toronto, Spadina Avenue became a hotspot for a loose affiliation of artists, notably Gordon Rayner, Graham Coughtry, and Robert Markle, who came to define the "Toronto look."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Goddard, [http://canadianart.ca/features/2014/07/11/remembering-spadina/ "Remembering Toronto’s 1960s Spadina Art Scene"], ''Canadian Art'', July 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable moments when Canadian contemporary artists—as individuals or groups—have distinguished themselves through commonality, international recognition, collaboration, or zeitgeist:

*The interdisciplinary artistic practice and international success of [[Michael Snow]] beginning in the 1960s
*[[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University]] (NSCAD University). In 1967 the artist [[Garry Kennedy]] was appointed President, remaking the College into an international centre for artistic activity and inviting notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in [[conceptual art]]. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]]
*The pioneering early [[video art]] of [[Lisa Steele]] (''[[Birthday Suit – with scars and defects]]'') and [[Colin Campbell (artist)|Colin Campbell]]
*The [[Vancouver School]] of [[Photoconceptualism]] (including [[Jeff Wall]], [[Rodney Graham]] and [[Stan Douglas]])
* The international success of [[AA Bronson]], [[Felix Partz]] and [[Jorge Zontal]]  under the name of [[General Idea]].
*The video art and photography of [[David Askevold]], an early and highly influential contributor to the development and pedagogy of the conceptual art movement. His work was included in the seminal exhibition Information at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1970. 
*The success of the career of [[Janet Cardiff]] and [[George Bures Miller]], who represented Canada at the 49th [[Venice Biennial]] in 2001

{{Wiktionary|commission}}
In [[art]], a '''commission''' is the act of requesting the creation of a [[work of art|piece]], often on behalf of another. Artwork may be commissioned by private individuals, by the government, or businesses. Commissions often resemble [[sponsor (commercial)|endorsement or sponsorship]].

In [[classical music]], [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]s often commission pieces from [[composer]]s, where the ensemble secures the composer's payment from private or public organizations or [[donor]]s.

== Commissions for public art ==

Throughout history, it has been common for rulers and governments to commission public art as a means of demonstrating power and wealth, or even for specific propaganda purposes.

In ancient Rome, large architectural projects were commissioned as symbols of imperial glory. The Roman [[Coliseum]] for example, was commissioned by Emperor [[Vespasian]]. Public statuary was widespread, depicting mythical and heroic figures. The [[frieze]] that is carved into the Marcus Column, located at the Campus Martius, depicts the figure of Victory, and would have been commissioned to honour successful military campaigns waged by Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Relief Sculpture Part II|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/antiquity/relief-sculpture-ancient-rome.htm|publisher=Visual Arts Cork|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Roman culture was anti-intellectual and held artists in low esteem, in contrast to ancient cultures such as the Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Roman Exhibits|url=http://www.mama.org/exhibits/ancient/roman/|publisher=Museum of Ancient and Modern Art,|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Babylonian. Despite this, however, the sheer amount of surviving artworks commissioned at the height of the Roman Empire are a testament to the rulers' recognition of art's effectiveness in influencing the public's opinions about its civilization and its government.

During the Renaissance, visual art flourished in the cities of Italy due to the patronage of wealthy merchants and government officials, such as [[Cesare Borgia]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] earned steady commissions for artwork ranging from paintings (such as the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' for the Church of San Francisco Grande), to murals (''[[Last Supper]]'' for the monastery church of Santa Maria della Grazia), to sculptures (the [[Gran Cavallo]] at [[Sforza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo Da Vinci|url=http://www.theartgallery.com.au/arteducation/greatartists/davinci/about/|publisher=The Worldwide Art Gallery|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous commissioned artwork of the Renaissance may be the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] at the Vatican, painted by [[Michelangelo]] as a commission for [[Pope Julius&amp;nbsp;II]].

Today, public artworks may be commissioned by benefactors who wish to donate the artwork to a city as a gift to the public. "Famine" (1997), a series of sculptures by [[Rowan Gillespie]] depicting victims of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], was commissioned by Norma Smurfit and donated to the city of [[Dublin]], Ireland. The harrowing memorial has brought other commissions to Gillespie, who has created companion sculptures for the cities of Toronto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Famine Memorial and The World Poverty Stone|url=http://www.ddda.ie/index.jsp?n=640&amp;p=112|publisher=Dublin Docklands Development Authority|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boston.

==Other uses==
An art gallery or dealer who sells artworks on an artist's behalf, typically takes a percentage of the price. This portion is called the gallery's "[[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]". The remainder of the proceeds goes to the artist. In this way, the gallery or dealer is not only the middleman but obliquely takes the role of "[[Patronage|patron]]" in that it provides representation, housing of artworks, marketing and income for the artist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">'''Dance is present in mythology and religion''' globally. Dance has certainly been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since before the birth of the earliest human [[civilization]]s. [[Archeology]] delivers traces of dance from [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] such as the 5,000-year-old [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] paintings in [[India]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of "love making." Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. p94-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name='guenther'&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early manuscript describing dance is the [[Natya Shastra]] on which is based the ''modern''  interpretation of [[classical Indian dance]] (e.g. [[Bharathanatyam]]).

== Greek mythology ==

In a classical Greek song, [[Apollo]], the god of medicine, music and poetry, one of the twelve greater gods and son of the chief god [[Zeus]], was called The Dancer. In a Greek line Zeus himself is represented as dancing.  [[Terpsichore]] is one of the nine Muses, representing dancing and dramatic chorus. In [[Sparta]], a province of ancient Greece, the law compelled parents to exercise their children in dancing from the age of five years.  They were led by grown men, and sang hymns and songs as they danced.  
In very early times a [[Greek chorus]], consisting of the whole population of the city, would meet in the market-place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of the country.  Their jubilees were always attended with hymn-singing and dancing.

==Dance in Scriptures==
The [[Torah]], the [[Psalms]], and many other scriptures reference dance:

[[Old Testament]]
*'''A Time to Dance:'''
**Ecclesiastes 3:4
*'''Social Dance in celebration of what God has done:'''
**Exodus 15:20;
**Judges 21:21 - 23

**2 Samuel 6:14-16;
**1 Chronicles 15:29
*'''Social dancing in celebration of a god:'''
**Exodus 32:19;
**1 Kings 18:26 (The act of celebrating a false god is condemned here)
*'''A child's dance:'''
**Judges 11:34;
**Job 21:11
*'''Celebration of warriors:'''
**1 Samuel 18:6-7;
**1 Samuel 21:11;
**1 Samuel 29:5;
*'''As an expression of happiness:'''
**Psalm 30:11;

**[[Psalm 149]]:3;
**[[Psalm 150]]:4
*'''Social Dance with Friends:'''

*'''For the king: '''
**'''Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:22'''

===Hindu scriptures===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:classical Indian dance.jpg|right]] --&gt;
From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures, every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance) we read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsaras]]es who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in the Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshiped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

===Buddhism===
See [[Seungmu]]

===Chinese mythology===
*[[Lion dance]]

===Christianity ===
In the [[Protoevangelium of James]], it is reported that [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] at the time of her [[Presentation of the Virgin|presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the history of Christianity, several denominations and independent congregations prohibited social dancing for various reasons;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/diessay8.html Western Social Dance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, dance has always been a part of the social life of many Christians. Christian lyrics are found in the sounds of Ballroom, Country, Rock and Roll, Latin, Night Club, and other dance music. [[Ballet]] originated in Italy at weddings.

Numerous examples of traditional dance can be found in modern [[Roman Catholic]] communities. The Brazilian dance and martial art of [[capoeira]] (particularly [[capoeira angola]]) is regularly performed—including between ''capoeiristas'' of different sexes—to lyrics and ''ladinhas'' (litanies) praising God, the saints, and the Virgin. In a similar vein, several genres of dance music in [[Romani people]]/[[Romani people|Romani]] culture involve religious themes and lyrics. In the Philippines, the ''[[Subli]]''&amp;mdash;a devotional dance of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas Province]]&amp;mdash;honours the [[True Cross]]. Finally, the celebrations of [[Carnival]] and [[Mardi Gras]] feature dance.

Many [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostal]] [[Protestant]] denomonations practice dance during worship services. Congregants frequently dance during services as an act of worship. Some Charismatics practice [[prophetic dance]], a religious practice in which practitioners believe they are representing what the Lord is doing through their movements. This is often accompanied with banners, ribbons and, instruments. [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]] in [[Redding, California]] has a school where people who wished to be trained in prophetic dance can go.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8493">'''Developmental editing''' is a form of writing support that comes into play before or during the production of a publishable manuscript, especially in the area of [[Non-fiction|non-fiction writing]]. As explained by Scott Norton in his book ''Developmental editing: a handbook for freelancers, authors, and publishers'', developmental editing involves "significant structuring or restructuring of a manuscript's discourse".&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt; Developmental editors are a type of [[language professional]].

==The work of developmental editors==
A developmental editor may guide an author (or group of authors) in conceiving the topic, planning the overall structure, and developing an outline—and may coach authors in their writing, chapter by chapter. This is true developmental editing, but not the most common way of working.&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt; More commonly, a developmental editor is engaged only after someone (usually the publisher) decides that the authors' draft requires substantial revision and restructuring. In these cases, developmental editing is a radical form of substantive editing.&lt;ref name="DefiningEdit" /&gt;

Irrespective of when the developmental editor is brought into a writing project, authors retain control over the document and are responsible for providing the content. An editor who creates significant amounts of content is no longer an editor but a contributing author or a [[ghostwriter]].&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt;

==Textbooks==
[[Textbook]]s represent one book genre in which developmental editors are involved from the beginning, and often serve as the book's project manager.&lt;ref name="PatBrewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;  Their role is fundamental in textbook publishing because it is often the publisher, not the author, who decides on the book's content, scope, and level. Thus, developmental editors are often on staff at scholastic publishing houses.&lt;ref name="UChicago" /&gt; In textbook publishing, the developmental editor may be responsible for creating the outline to guide the author's writing—and may also prepare short parts of text, such as legends, exercises, and supporting materials.&lt;ref name="PatBrewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; Furthermore, the editor manages text length, edits the developing manuscript, and may instruct an artist regarding illustrations.&lt;ref name="IntBookPub" /&gt;

==In the setting of academic research==
In the academic research setting, career advancement and funding depend on the number and quality of published papers. However, not all researchers are naturally skilled writers, especially among those in the hard and clinical sciences, and many do not receive formal training in how to write the specific [[genre]] of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|research paper]]. These researchers can benefit from a [[language professional]] such as a teacher of academic writing or an [[Author editing|authors' editor]] who provides substantive editing. In extreme cases, when the drafted manuscript does not match the genre and requires substantial restructuring before being able to meet readers' and peer reviewers' expectations, the language professional may offer developmental editing; however certain professional and ethical issues must be considered.&lt;ref name="CollabWrite" /&gt;

There are two main situations when developmental editing in the research setting can be useful.&lt;ref name="CollabWrite" /&gt; First, researchers may recognize their inability to produce a manuscript with reasonable chances of passing peer review in their target journal; they may contact a language professional for assistance and guidance during the writing process. In addition, researchers whose manuscript has suffered multiple rejections&lt;ref name="MultiRej" /&gt; from different journals may seek help resolving the complex issues raised by peer reviewers. In both cases, the type of writing support goes beyond [[author editing]] and becomes a form of academic [[mentoring]]. Mentoring programs using a developmental editing approach to teach scholarly writing skills have been offered, for example, by an international education journal&lt;ref name="Compare" /&gt; and at a US medical school.&lt;ref name="CMP" /&gt; Developmental editing is also at the heart of [[AuthorAID]], a program that matches authors from the developing world with experienced scientist mentors and professional editors to improve the dissemination of knowledge from poor countries.&lt;ref name="AuthorAid" /&gt;

Whether the language professional is an authors' editor, a teacher of academic writing, or a translator, the particularly challenging situation requires developmental editing alongside other writing support services (e.g., education about good writing practices, translation, and linguistic editing). Language professionals who support such novice researcher-authors know to perform editorial—not authorial—duties, so they avoid [[ghost writing]] if [[authorship]] is not wanted.

'''Drinking birds''', also known as '''insatiable birdies, dunking birds, drinky birds''' or '''dipping birds''',&lt;ref name="perelman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Perelman |first=Yakov |date=1972 |origyear=1936 |title=Physics for Entertainment |volume=2 |pages=175–178 |isbn=978-1401309213|url=https://archive.org/details/PhysicsForEntertainmentBook2}} [https://archive.org/download/PhysicsForEntertainmentBook2] [http://booksnote.com/phydownload?bdn=PhysicsforEntertainmentBook2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=American Physical Society |year=2012 |title=Insatiable Birdie |publisher=American Physical Society, with permission of the Hyperion(Reprint edition) |url=http://www.physicscentral.com/explore/writers/perelman.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Exploratorium Teacher Institute |authorlink=Exploratorium |date=1993-07-27 |title=Exhibit-Based Energy Teaching at the Exploratorium |publisher=[[US Department of Energy]] [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]] |page=3 |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6421909-YYI69H/ |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-03}} [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/6421909-YYI69H/ (cover page URL)]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[toy]] [[heat engine]]s that mimic the motions of a bird drinking from a water source. They are sometimes incorrectly considered examples of a [[perpetual motion]] device.

==Construction and materials==
A drinking bird consists of two glass bulbs joined by a glass tube (the bird's neck). The tube extends nearly all the way into the bottom bulb, and attaches to the top bulb but does not extend into it. The space inside the bird contains a fluid, usually colored. The fluid is typically [[dichloromethane]], also known as methylene chloride. Earlier versions contained [[trichlorofluoromethane]]. Miles V. Sullivan's 1945 patent suggested [[ether]], [[alcohol]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], or [[chloroform]].&lt;ref name="US2402463" /&gt;

Air is removed from the apparatus during manufacture, so the space inside the body is filled by vapor evaporated from the fluid.&lt;ref name="US2402463" /&gt; The upper bulb has a "beak" attached which, along with the head, is covered in a felt-like material.&lt;ref name="US2402463" /&gt; The bird is typically decorated with paper eyes, a plastic top hat, and one or more tail feathers. The whole setup pivots on an adjustable crosspiece attached to the neck.

Despite the drinking bird's appearance and classification as a toy there is a potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.&lt;ref name="USDHHS"&gt;{{cite web|author=USDHHS|title=Toxicological Profile for Methylene Chloride|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp14.pdf|accessdate=2006-09-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat engine steps==
[[File:Drinkend vogeltje video.ogg|thumb|right]]
The drinking bird is a [[heat engine]] that exploits a temperature difference to convert [[thermal energy|heat energy]] to a pressure difference within the device, and performs [[work (physics)|mechanical work]]. Like all heat engines, the drinking bird works through a [[thermodynamic cycle]]. The initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically.

The process operates as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Güémez |first1=J. |last2=Valiente |first2=R. |last3=Fiolhais |first3=C. |last4=Fiolhais  |first4=M. |date=December 2003 |title=Experiments with the drinking bird |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1603272 |bibcode=2003AmJPh..71.1257G |volume=71 |issue=12 |pages=1257–1263 |url=http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/personal/mfiolhais/artigosdid/did14.pdf |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The water evaporates from the felt on the head.
# Evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head ([[enthalpy of vaporization|heat of vaporization]]).
# The temperature decrease causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense.
# The lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head (by the [[ideal gas law]]).
# The higher [[vapor pressure]] in the warmer base pushes the liquid up the neck.
# As the liquid rises, the bird becomes top heavy and tips over.
# When the bird tips over, the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid.
# A bubble of warm vapor rises up the tube through this gap, displacing liquid as it goes.
# Liquid flows back to the bottom bulb (the toy is designed so that when it has tipped over the neck's tilt allows this). Pressure equalizes between top and bottom bulbs.
# The weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position
# The liquid in the bottom bulb is heated by ambient air, which is at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the bird's head.

If a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a [[perpetual motion]] machine.

==Physical and chemical principles==
[[File:The Engineering of the Drinking Bird.webm|thumb|Video ''The Engineering of the Drinking Bird'']]
The drinking bird is an exhibition of several [[physical law]]s and is therefore a staple of basic [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] education. These include:
* The [[dichloromethane]] with a low [[boiling point]] (39.6&amp;nbsp;°C, 103.28&amp;nbsp;°F under standard pressure ''p''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] - as the drinking bird is first evacuated, partially filled and sealed, the pressure and thus the boiling point in the drinking bird will be different), gives the heat engine the ability to extract motion from low temperatures.  The drinking bird is a heat engine that works at room temperature.
* The [[combined gas law]], which establishes a proportional relationship between temperature and pressure exerted by a gas in a constant volume.
* The [[ideal gas law]], which establishes a proportional relationship between number of gas particles and pressure in a constant volume.
* The [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], which establishes that molecules in a given space at a given temperature vary in energy level, and therefore can exist in multiple [[Phase (matter)|phases]] (solid/liquid/gas) at a single temperature.
* [[enthalpy of vaporization|Heat of vaporization]] (or condensation), which establishes that substances absorb (or give off) heat when changing state at a constant temperature.
* [[Torque]] and [[center of mass]].
* [[Capillary action]] of the wicking felt.
* [[Wet-bulb temperature]]: The temperature difference between the head and body depends on the relative humidity of the air.

By considering the difference between the wet and dry bulb temperatures, it is possible to develop a mathematical expression to calculate the maximum work that can be produced from a given amount of water "drunk". Such analysis is based on the definition of the [[Carnot heat engine]] efficiency and the [[psychrometric]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Three hand-solved thermodynamics exercises for fun |publisher=Flórez-Orrego, Daniel.

==History==
By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called "pulse hammer" (''Pulshammer'').  In 1767 [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb.&lt;ref&gt;For videos of Franklin's pulse hammer in operation, see:

In 1881 Israel L. Landis got a patent for a similar oscillating motor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US250821 US250821]&lt;/ref&gt;
A year later (1882), the Iske brothers got a patent for a similar motor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US253868&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the drinking bird, the lower tank was heated and the upper tank just air-cooled in this engine. Other than that, it used the same principle. The Iske brothers during that time got various patents on a related engine which is now known as [[Minto wheel]].

A Chinese drinking bird toy dating back to 1910s~1930s named ''insatiable birdie'' is described in [[Yakov Perelman]]'s ''Physics for Entertainment''.&lt;ref name="perelman" /&gt; The book explained the "insatiable" mechanism: "Since the headtube's temperature becomes lower than that of the tail reservoir, this causes a drop in the pressure of the saturated vapours in the head-tube ..."&lt;ref name="perelman" /&gt; It was said in Shanghai, China, that when [[Albert Einstein]] and his wife, Elsa, arrived in Shanghai in 1922, they were fascinated by the Chinese "insatiable birdie" toy.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Calaprice and Trevor Lipscombe, ''Albert Einstein: A Biography'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005):86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the Japanese professor of toys, Takao Sakai, from [[Tohoku University]], also introduced this Chinese toy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=酒井高男 (Takao Sakai) |date=February 1977 |isbn=4061179101 |script-title=ja:おもちゃの科学 |publisher=講談社 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arthur M. Hillery got a patent in 1945. Arthur M. Hillery suggested the use of [[acetone]] as working fluid.&lt;ref name="US2384168"&gt;{{US patent|US2384168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Chinese invention was again patented in the US by Miles V. Sullivan in 1946.&lt;ref name="US2402463" /&gt;
He was a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Murray Hill, NJ]], USA.&lt;ref name="US2402463"&gt;{{US patent|2402463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Sullivan also holds patents on several novelty items such as the well-known drinking bird."

==Notable usage in popular culture==
The drinking bird has been used in many fictional contexts to automatically press buttons. In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[King-Size Homer]]", Homer used one to repeatedly press a key on a computer keyboard. [[Herb Powell]] also showed one to Homer as part of a demonstration regarding inventions in the episode "[[Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?]]". Two of them were used in the 1990 film ''[[Darkman]]'' to set off explosions. Drinking birds have appeared as part of a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] in the film ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefilmcynics.com/blog/?p=2203&amp;cpage=1|title=Top 5 Film Contraptions|publisher=The Film Cynics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310185119/http://www.thefilmcynics.com/blog/?p=2203&amp;cpage=1|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}} (with video)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter]]".

Drinking birds have been featured as plot elements in the 1951 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon ''[[Putty Tat Trouble]]'' and the 1968 science fiction thriller ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]''. They have also had minor appearances in several movies and TV shows, including the [[Woody Allen]] movie ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'', the 1979 science fiction film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (also referenced in ''[[Alien 3]] and [[Alien: Covenant]]''), the 1989 comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'', the 2008 film ''[[Max Payne (film)|Max Payne]]'', the 2010 film ''[[Megamind]]'', and episodes of the American TV shows ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]''. Episode 508 of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' features a spoof of the drinking bird called the ''Bobbing Buzzard'', which runs on [[carrion]] instead of water.

Among video games, the drinking bird appeared as the "dunkin' dragon" in the [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] game ''[[Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero|Quest for Glory]]'' (1989), in the [[Gremlin Interactive]] game ''[[Normality (video game)|Normality]]'' (1996), and as a "water bird" furniture item in the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' games (2001). Porygon2, a Pokémon introduced in Generation II ([[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]), resembles a drinking bird, and in 3D ''Pokémon'' games, it moves its head in a "dipping" motion. More recently, in the game ''[[Quantum Conundrum]]'' (2012), one of the main gameplay mechanics is a drinking bird that is used as a timer to press buttons. In the 2014 [[Creative Assembly]] video game ''[[Alien: Isolation]]'', drinking birds are frequently seen on desks across the game's main setting, Sevastopol Station.

In Australian contemporary playwright [[John Romeril]]'s play ''The Floating World'', drinking birds are a symbolic prop which represent the progression of Les's insanity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/reading-australia/john-romeril/the-floating-world-by-john-romeril|title=Reading Australia: 'The Floating World' by John Romeril&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to as "dippy birds" and are perhaps used to symbolize such a thing due to Romeril's opinion of drinking birds being that they are insane for their uselessness and repeatability.

== Alternative design ==
In 2003 an alternative mechanism was devised by Nadine Abraham and Peter Palffy-Muhoray of Ohio, USA, that utilizes capillary action combined with evaporation to produce motion, but has no volatile working fluid.  Their paper "A Dunking Bird of the Second Kind" ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=Nadine|last2=Palffy-Muhoray|first2=Peter|date=June 2004|title=A dunking bird of the second kind|url=http://mpalffy.lci.kent.edu/PAPERS/DBPublished.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=72|issue=6|pages=782–785|bibcode=2004AmJPh..72..782A|doi=10.1119/1.1703543|accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted to the American Journal of Physics, and published in June 2004. It describes a mechanism which, while similar to the original drinking bird, operates without a temperature difference. Instead it utilizes a combination of [[capillary action]], gravitational potential difference and the [[evaporation]] of water to power the device.

This bird works as follows: It is balanced such that, when dry, it tips into a head-down position.  The bird is placed next to a water source such that this position brings its beak into contact with water.  Water is then lifted into the beak by capillary action (the authors used a triangular sponge) and carried by capillary action past the fulcrum to a larger sponge reservoir which they fashioned to resemble wings.  When enough water has been absorbed by the reservoir, the now-heavy bottom causes the bird to tip into a head-up position.  With the beak out of the water, eventually enough water evaporates from the sponge that the original balance is restored and the head tips down again. Although a small drop in temperature may occur due to evaporative cooling, this does not contribute to the motion of the bird. The device operates relatively slowly with 7 hours 22 minutes being the average cycle time measured.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7763">'''Eau de Cologne''' ({{IPA-fr|o d(ə) kɔlɔɲ|lang}}; German: '''''Kölnisch Wasser''''' {{IPA-de|ˈkœlnɪʃ ˈvasɐ|}}; meaning "Water from Cologne"), or simply '''cologne''', is a [[perfume]] originating from [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. Originally mixed by [[Johann Maria Farina]] in 1709, it has since come to be a generic term for scented formulations in typical concentration of 2–5% and also more depending upon its type [[essential oil]]s or a blend of extracts, alcohol, and water. 
In a base of dilute [[ethanol]] (70–90%), eau de cologne contains a mixture of [[citrus]] oils including oils of [[lemon]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[clementine]], [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[grapefruit]], [[blood orange]], and [[bitter orange]]. It can also contain oils of [[neroli]], [[lavender]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], [[oregano]], [[petitgrain]] (orange leaf), [[jasmine]], [[olive]], [[oleaster]], and [[tobacco]].

In contemporary American English usage, the term "cologne" has become a generic term for [[perfume]]s usually marketed towards men. It also may signify a less concentrated (but more affordable) version of a popular perfume. 

==History==
[[File:1811-Rosoli-Flacon.jpg|thumb|An eau de cologne by Farina (1811).]]
[[File:Eau de Cologne 1280470.JPG|thumb|4711 cologne - the most famous Eau de Cologne.]]
The original ''Eau de Cologne'' is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in [[Cologne]] in 1709 by [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), an [[Italy|Italian]] perfume maker from [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Piedmont |Santa Maria Maggiore]] [[Valle Vigezzo]]. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: "I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain".&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein and Sykes, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; He named his fragrance ''Eau de Cologne'', in honour of his new hometown.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;Fischer&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Original Eau de Cologne [[4711]]'', is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by [[Wilhelm Mülhens]] and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest still produced fragrances in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company [[Mäurer &amp; Wirtz]] took over 4711 from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.

The ''Eau de Cologne'' composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to "nearly all royal houses in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Farina [[Fragrance Museum]] information leaflet&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. A single vial of this ''aqua mirabilis'' ([[Latin]] for miracle water) cost half the annual salary of a civil servant.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of ''Eau de Cologne'' prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of ''Eau de Cologne''. Giovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in [[Cologne]] since 1709 by [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina opposite the Jülichplatz]]&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory.

In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), opened a perfumery business in [[Paris]] that was later sold to [[Roger &amp; Gallet]]. That company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'' in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]]. Originally the water of Cologne was believed to have the power to ward off bubonic plague.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Paul M. S. ''Physical Chemistry: Understanding Our Chemical World''. 2004. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; By drinking the cologne the citrus oil scent would be exuded through the pores, repelling fleas. Much as flea shampoo for dogs can be based on citrus oils today.

In modern times, ''Eau de Cologne'' or "cologne", has become a generic term. The term "cologne" can be applied to perfume for men or women, but it conventionally refers to perfumes marketed towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanywanderer.com/the-history-behind-eau-de-cologne/|title=The history behind eau de cologne|publisher=Germany Wanderer|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drinking==
In former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries (mainly Russia), varieties of Troynoy ''Eau de Cologne'' may be used as a [[surrogate alcohol]] among poor [[alcohol intoxication|alcoholics]], especially because it is very cheaply priced compared to [[vodka]].&lt;ref name=drinking&gt;{{cite news|title='Aftershave drink' kills Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6752515.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estonian literature''' ({{lang-et|eesti kirjandus}}) is literature written in the [[Estonian language]] (c. 1,100,000 speakers) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033090/Estonian-literature Estonian literature] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt; The domination of [[Estonia]] after the [[Northern Crusades]], from the 13th century to 1918 by Germany, Sweden, and Russia resulted in few early written literary works in the Estonian language. The oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century. ''Originates Livoniae'' in [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]] contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The ''[[Liber Census Daniae]]'' (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.&lt;ref name="DWE"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&amp;dq The Development of Written Estonian by George Kurman] {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant samples of connected Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owQBH74N8CIC&amp;pg Aspects of Altaic Civilization by Denis Sinor] {{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known printed book is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.Wanradt and J. Koell (1535). For the use of priests an Estonian grammar was printed in German in 1637.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC&amp;pg Dictionary of Languages By Andrew Dalby; p. 182] {{ISBN|0-231-11569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New Testament]] was translated into [[Võro language|southern Estonian]] in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two dialects were united by Anton Thor Helle in a form based on northern Estonian. Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the [[Estophilia#Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840)|Estophile Enlightenment Period]] (1750–1840).

The cultural stratum of Estonian was originally characterised by a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity. Apart from a few albeit remarkable exceptions, this archaic form has not been much employed in later times. The most outstanding achievements in this field are the national epic [[Kalevipoeg]] (Son of Kalev), written by [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803–1882); [[Gustav Suits]]'s ballad ''Lapse sünd'' (Birth of a Child); [[Villem Grünthal-Ridala]]'s (1885–1942) poem ''Toomas ja Mai'' (Toomas and Mai) and three poems by [[August Annist]] (1899–1972). At a professional level, traditional folk song reached its new heyday during the last quarter of the 20th century, primarily thanks to the work of composer [[Veljo Tormis]].

In modern times [[Jaan Kross]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kross Jaan Kross] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaan Kaplinski]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?as_q=&amp;num=20&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;&amp;as_auth=Jaan+Kaplinski Jaan Kaplinski] at google.books&lt;/ref&gt; remain [[Estonia]]'s best known and most translated writers.

==History of Estonian literature==
[[Image:EstonianGrammar1637.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Estonian grammar]] (1637) by Heinrich Stahl]]

===Folklore===
{{main|Estonian folklore}}
As opposed to the recent nature of written literature, the oral tradition, found in collections of Estonian folklore, tells of the ancient pre-[[Northern Crusades]] period of independence. The first fragmentary records of Estonian folk poetry, dating from the 13th century, can be found in the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]]; in the late 18th century Johann Gottfried von Herder published examples of Estonian folk songs in his anthology ''Volkslieder'' (1807). [[Jakob Hurt]] (1839–1907) was the first to start systematically collecting Estonian folklore in the second half of the 19th century,  planning a multi-volume series on Estonian folklore, called ''[[Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae]]''. Hurt coined the phrase which to this day shapes the mentality of the nation of one million people: ''If we cannot be great in number, then we must be great in spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=944 Finno-Ugric folklore and the European written word] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic Germans===
Chronicles and theatrical performances by the [[Baltic German]] nobility formed the basis for local Baltic German literature which, despite the barriers of status and language, affected Estonian literature. The earliest example of Estonian language poetry dates back to 1637, a poem written by Reiner Brockmann (1609–1647), teacher of Greek at the [[Tallinn]] Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=945 Baltic Germans at the birth of Estonian literature] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Otto Wilhelm Masing]] (1763&amp;ndash;1832) was the first literate who had a thorough mastery of the [[Estonian language]].&lt;ref name="DWE"/&gt;

===Kristjan Jaak Peterson===

''Cannot the tongue of this land''&lt;br /&gt;
''In the fire of incantation''&lt;br /&gt;
''Rising up to the heavens''&lt;br /&gt;
''Seek for eternity?''&lt;br /&gt;
:::''Kristjan Jaak Peterson''

Those lines have been interpreted as a claim to reestablish the birthright of the Estonian language. '''[[Kristjan Jaak Peterson]]''' (1801–1822) is considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. He gathered his Estonian poems into two small books but never saw them published: this only occurred a hundred years after his death (although three German poems were published posthumously in 1823). One of Peterson's projects was fulfilled in his lifetime, the German version of Kristfrid Ganander's ''Mythologia Fennica'', a dictionary of Finnish mythological words and names (the Swedish original was published in 1789). Peterson's translation of Ganander's dictionary found many readers in Estonia and abroad, becoming an important source of national ideology and inspiration for early Estonian literature. Its dominating influence extended through the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=1966 Kristian Jaak Peterson] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kalevipoeg===
[[Image:Kreutzwald-köler.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] ]]
The outstanding achievements in folklore imitate the epics: the national epic [[Kalevipoeg]] was compiled by doctors of Estonian origin: [[Friedrich Robert Faehlmann]] began the epic and it was finished by [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]]. The romantic ideology of the 19th century laid down  the requirements for a national literature. The idea of an epic was the product of a humanist circle called the [[Learned Estonian Society]] (Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft), where Faehlmann had presented his paper in 1839 on a mythical hero called Kalewipoeg (Son of Kalew). After Faehlmann's death in 1850 the society handed the manuscripts over to Kreutzwald. The first edition of "Kalevipoeg" (1857–61) was bilingual, the German text being presented side by side with the Estonian original. A popular Estonian edition in a single volume followed in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=1966 Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lydia Koidula]] (1843–1886) was the initiator of a tradition of Estonian patriotic and [[Women in Estonia|women]]'s poetry during the era.

===Late 19th early 20th century===

In the late 19th-century a poet emerged who profoundly affected Estonian poetry as a whole – [[Juhan Liiv]] (1864–1913). During the last decade of the 19th century, a contemporary of Liiv's, [[Eduard Vilde]] (1865–1933), gave a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] direction to Estonian prose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=946 Literature in the 19th century] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

With the formation of the group Noor-Eesti (Young Estonia) in 1905, led by the poet [[Gustav Suits]] (1883–1956), the linguist and poet [[Villem Grünthal-Ridala]] (1885-1942) and the reformer of the Estonian language [[Johannes Aavik]] (1880–1973), Estonian literature gained a new intellectual impetus. The most prominent prose writer of the time, still widely read today, was [[Oskar Luts]] (1887–1953). Another significant author was [[Jaan Oks]] (1884–1918).The poetry of [[Ernst Enno]] (1875–1934) gained popularity much later.

The rationality of the Young Estonians was counterbalanced by the group of writers from the [[Siuru]] movement, established in 1917. The central and peripheral poets of Siuru were: [[August Gailit]] (1891-1960), [[Friedebert Tuglas]] (1886-1971), [[Johannes Semper]] (1892-1970), [[Artur Adson]] (1889-1977), [[August Alle]] (1890-1952), [[Henrik Visnapuu]] (1890–1951), [[Peet Aren]] (1889-1970), [[Otto Krusten]] (1888-1937) and [[Marie Under]] (1883–1980).

The magazine ''Eesti Kirjandus'' (''Estonian Literature'') was founded in 1906, and ''Eesti Kirjanduse Selts'' (Estonian Literary Society) in 1907.

===1918-1940===
After the establishment of the [[Republic of Estonia]], professionalism and diversity in literature were followed by the emergence of literary institutions. The Estonian Writers Union was founded in 1922; the literary monthly ''[[Looming (journal)|Looming]]'' (Creation) first appeared in 1923 and is still the main periodical of its sort in Estonia. The Cultural Endowment Fund started work in 1925 and is the major provider of grants in the arts in the present-day Republic of Estonia.

The prevailing tendency in prose writing between the two World Wars was realism. The most prominent writer of the era is [[Anton Hansen Tammsaare]] (1878–1940). His five volume epic novel ''Tõde ja Õigus'' (Truth and Justice, 1926–1933) is considered one of the major works of Estonian literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tammsaar.htm |title=Anton Tammsaare |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054341/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/tammsaar.htm |archivedate=5 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent prose writers were [[August Mälk]] (1900–1987), [[Karl Ristikivi]] (1912–1977). [[August Gailit]], the incurable romantic, appeared on the literary scene along with the [[Siuru]] group.

The ''[[Arbujad]]'' ("Soothsayers") was a small but influential group of poets who began collaborating in 1938 at the behest of poet and author [[Ants Oras]] (1900-1982) and included: [[Betti Alver]] (1906–1989), [[Uku Masing]] (1909–1985), [[Mart Raud]] (1903–1980), [[Kersti Merilaas]] (1913–1986), [[Bernard Kangro]] (1910–1994), [[Heiti Talvik]] (1904–1947), [[August Sang]] (1914–1969) and [[Paul Viiding]] (1904–1962). While group's poetic works tended to be eclectic, there was a common desire among members to reach a deeper intellectual and emotional plane. The ''Arbujad'' poets were for the freedom and independence of the people while being against ideological coercion and totalitarian concepts.

===Post World War II===
After the [[Estonia in World War II|Second World War]] Estonian literature was split in two for almost half a century. A number of prominent writers who spent the war years in Estonia fled from Soviet forces to Germany in 1944 (Visnapuu) or to Sweden, either directly or via Finland (Suits, Under, Gailit, Kangro, Mälk, Ristikivi). Many of those who remained behind and did not follow the ideology of the Soviet occupying power suffered either death in Siberia (Talvik and playwright Hugo Raudsepp) or a combination of repression, a ban on publication and interior exile ([[Friedebert Tuglas|Tuglas]], Alver, Masing). Despite the modest circumstances of the war and post-war years, creative activity and publishing started almost immediately, both in the temporary stopovers in Finland, and in the refugee camps in Sweden and Germany.

====In Exile====
In 1945 the Estonian Writers' Union in Exile was founded in [[Stockholm]]. In 1950 [[Bernard Kangro]] began publishing the cultural magazine ''Tulimuld'' in Lund (published until 1993). Eesti Kirjanike Kooperatiiv, the largest Estonian-language publishing house in exile, was set up and its method of book distribution secured the continuity of literary life on an institutional level and on a global scale, except in the Soviet-controlled homeland. Estonians abroad also did their best to introduce Estonian literature to the world: in the USA, [[Ivar Ivask]] (1927–1992) edited ''[[World Literature Today]]'' in which he published numerous articles and reviews about Estonian literature.

The poetry collection by surrealist [[Ilmar Laaban]] (1921–2000) was at first the only modernist work, until 1953 when [[Karl Ristikivi]], essentially a conservative writer, published his novel  ''The Night of the Souls''. [[Arved Viirlaid]]'s (1922) novel ''Seitse kohtupäeva'' (Seven Days of Trial, 1957) was a detour into modernism.  [[Ilmar Jaks]] (1923) became a more consistent cultivator of the technique of the modern novel. The subject matter of literary output was greatly enriched by descriptions of the countries where various writers had settled, like  [[Karl Rumor]] (1886–1971) in Brazil, or [[Gert Helbemäe]] (1913–1974) in England.  In the second half of the 1950s Kalju Lepik (1920–1999) was a poet in exile who rose to prominence alongside Bernard Kangro. Kalju Lepik's first visit to his homeland in 1990 and the publication of his last collections of poetry there, symbolises the end of the split.

====Behind the Iron Curtain====

In Estonia a relaxation of the strictures of the Soviet regime after the death of Stalin opened the way for various Estonian writers: [[Minni Nurme]] (1917-1994), [[Jaan Kross]]  (1920–2007) [[Artur Alliksaar]] (1923–1966), [[Ain Kaalep]] (born 1921), [[Kersti Merilaas]] (1916–1986) and [[Ellen Niit]] (born 1928). Against that background a new "Cassette Generation"  emerged in 1962-1967 (so-called because of the small poetry chapbooks which appeared together in small cardboard boxes termed ''kassett'' in Estonian). [[Jaan Kaplinski]] (born 1941) was greatly inspired by Oriental religion and nature. Other authors of note were [[Hando Runnel]] (born 1938), [[Viivi Luik]] (born 1946), [[Mats Traat]] (born 1936), [[Andres Ehin]] (born 1940) and [[Ilmar Laaban]]. 

The political stagnation that followed the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 was reflected in [[Paul-Eerik Rummo]]'s initially banned minimalist collection. The collection did not appear in its entirety until 1989. So-called alternative literature was disseminated in manuscript form, the most significant authors in this field being the dissident poet Johnny B. Isotamm (born 1939) and the prose writer [[Toomas Vint]]  (born 1944). The most remarkable poet of the 1960s and 1970s was [[Juhan Viiding]]  (pseudonym Jüri  Üdi, 1948–1995, son of former Arbujad member, poet Paul Viiding), whose first collection "Nerve Print" appeared in 1971. Despite all attempts to ban it, the popular and song-like nature of Hando Runnel's patriotic verse secured its huge circulation. His collection "The Purple of the Red Evenings", 1982 was allowed into print but the publication of any reviews in the press remained forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=948 The split in Estonian literature] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991-2001===
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] led to the restoration of [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]]'s [[History of Estonia#Regaining independence|independence]]. The two Estonian Writers' Unions were merged in 2000.

In a way, Emil Tode’s (pen name of [[Tõnu Õnnepalu]], 1962) "Piiririik" ("Border State") marked the beginning of a new era in 1993. The novel claimed its place beside the internationally recognised and translated works by Kross or Kaplinski. "Border State" also raised the topic of "Euro-literature", where one of the central issues is the wanderings of Estonians abroad, their search for an identity in a world with open borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/12/estonian-lit-during-last-decade-stars-and-trends Estonian literature during the last decade - Stars and trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intertextual poetry of [[Jaan Undusk]] (born 1958), [[Mati Unt]] and [[Viivi Luik]] and [[Hasso Krull]] (born 1964) prepared the ground for a bold new Estonian literature. The most remarkable prose writers of the younger generation of recent years are [[Andrus Kivirähk]] (born 1970), [[Karl-Martin Sinijärv]] (born 1971), [[Mehis Heinsaar]] (born 1973), [[Peeter Sauter]] (born 1962) or [[Jüri Ehlvest]]  (1967–2006), who deepened the subjects and topics opened up by Õnnepalu in a way both comical and cryptic. 

[[Jaan Kross]] and [[Jaan Kaplinski]] remain Estonia's best known and most translated writers, although in recent years the short stories of [[Eeva Park]] and the novels of Tõnu Õnnepalu and [[Ervin Õunapuu]] have also been enjoying moderate success in Germany and Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/14/mission-estonia-estonian-literature-finnish Mission Estonia. On Estonian Literature in Finnish]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaan Kross has been tipped for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] on several occasions. On his return from the labour camps and internal exile in Russia, where he spent nine long years (1946–1954) as a political prisoner, Kross breathed new life into Estonian poetry.  Kross began writing prose in the latter half of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=646 Jaan Kross] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;  Jaan Kaplinski has become the central and most productive Modernist in Estonian poetry. Kaplinski has written essays, plays and has translated. He has lectured in [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Trieste]], [[Taipei]], [[Stockholm]], [[Bologna]] and [[Cologne]], [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He has been Writer-in-Residence at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estlit.ee/index.php?id=625 Jaan Kaplinski] at Estonian Literature information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===The new century===
The beginning of the 21st century has been fruitful for Estonian literature. Blossoming out of the waning nineties; a new, vibrant generation of poets appeared. [[Jürgen Rooste]] (1979), [[Ivar Sild]] (1977), [[Wimberg]] (pen name of Jaak Urmet, 1979) and [[Kristiina Ehin]] (1977) have all distinctive voices combined with a profound knowledge of both Estonian and world literature.

Rooste is definitely the most socially-involved and "beat-like" of them all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/23/jurgen-rooste-love-and-pain/ Jürgen Rooste - Love and Pain]&lt;/ref&gt; Sild proclaims his gay outlook, Wimberg creates absurd landscapes through the use of childlike language and style&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/17/wimberg/ Wimberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ehin maintains the tradition of the "great female poet" of Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/25/kristiina-ehins-drums-silence-new-moon-morning/ Kristiina Ehin's Drums of Silence on a New Moon Morning]&lt;/ref&gt;

But prose also flourishes. Over recent years, the work of [[Rein Raud]] has won him both numerous awards at home and international acclaim. His most notable books include "The Reconstruction", the story of a dying father trying to find out the circumstances of his daughter's suicide in a religious cult (2012, in English 2017, Dalkey Archive Press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/product/the-reconstruction/|title=The Reconstruction {{!}} Dalkey Archive Press|website=www.dalkeyarchive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and "The Brother" (2008, in English 2016, Open Letter Books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openletterbooks.org/collections/books/products/the-brother|title=The Brother - Open Letter|website=Open Letter|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), called by the author "a spaghetti Western in poetic prose". [[Andrus Kivirähk]] has skilfully combined his comic talent and ethno-fantasy in "The Man Who Spoke Snakish" (2007, in English 2015, Grove Press&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groveatlantic.com/?title=The+Man+Who+Spoke+Snakish|title=The Man Who Spoke Snakish by Andrus Kivirahk|website=www.groveatlantic.com|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Indrek Hargla]] is a prolific writer of several kinds of genre fiction including sci-fi, fantasy and crime. His reputation relies mainly on his Apothecary Melchior series, set in medieval Tallinn. Besides [[Kaur Kender]] (1971), whose finest hour was in 1998 with the debut novel "Iseseisvuspäev" ("Independence Day"), a younger generation is appearing. [[Sass Henno]] (1982) stays in the [[Chuck Palahniuk]]-influenced tradition of Kaur Kender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/20/future-classics-how-should-freedom-be-used/ Future Classics - How Should Freedom Be Used?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaneldior]] wrote a quintessential novel in the manner of [[Bret Easton Ellis]] called "Kontrolli alt väljas" ("Out of Control") in 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://elm.einst.ee/issue/27/younger-estonian-prose/ Younger Estonian prose]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peeter Helme]]'s (1978) second novel "September" (2009) received critical acclaim for its realistic description of life in Tallinn's office environments as existed at the dawn of this new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/?id=119803 Tallinna plekkmehed ja plekknaised]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fellowship of Southern Writers''' is a [[literature|literary]] organization founded in 1987 in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] by 21 [[Southern United States|Southern]] writers and other literary luminaries.  The group meets in every odd-numbered year, usually during the Chattanooga Arts &amp; Education Council Conference on [[southern literature|Southern Literature]].

In 2007, the fellowship formalized its own structure, electing its first board of directors and hiring its first executive director, Susan Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/308/story/759906.html newsobserver.com | Extending the lines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"Field of the British Isles" at Salisbury Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 251484.jpg|thumb|''Field for the British Isles'' at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] in 1999 ]]

'''''Field''''' (1991) is a sculpture by [[United Kingdom|British]] artist [[Antony Gormley]]. It consists of approx. 35,000 [http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=6&amp;page=1] individual [[terracotta]] figures, each between 8 and 26&amp;nbsp;cm high, installed on the floor of a room facing the viewer. The figures were sculpted in [[Cholula, Puebla|Cholula]], [[Mexico]] by about 60 members of a Texca family of brickmakers, under the supervision of the artist. The sculpture received a lot of media attention upon its first display, and many affectionate parodies.

''Field'' has been installed and displayed at various locations. The specific configuration is changed to suit each location, but the miniature figures are always placed to form a dense carpet with each figure looking towards the viewer. Ideally the Field is extended through a doorway or round a corner, so that the figures going out of sight leave the impression of an unlimited horde.

Several other versions of ''Field'' have subsequently been created, including
*''Amazonian Field'' (1991) made in [[Porto Velho]], [[Brazil]] (approx. 24,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=50&amp;page=1]
*''Field for the British Isles'' (1993) made in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] near [[Liverpool]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (approx. 40,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=47&amp;page=1]
*''European Field'' (1993) made in [[Östra Grevie]], [[Sweden]] (approx. 40,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=48&amp;page=1]
*''Asian Field'' (2003) made in [[Xiangshan County, Guangdong]], [[Guangdong]] province, [[People's Republic of China]] (approx. 190,000 figures)[http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=49&amp;page=1] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034550/http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-art-sculpture-antony-gormley-asian-field.html]
*''Field for the Art Gallery of New South Wales'' (1989) [http://www.antonygormley.com/viewphotoseries.php?photoseriesid=51&amp;page=1]

''Field for the British Isles'' was typical in recruiting some 100 volunteers from the pupils and their extended families, of two local schools in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]. Each volunteer was given a portion of the 30 tonnes of clay required, along with some loose instructions specifying the rough size and proportions for the figures. An accidental feature of the original Field was that Texca family involved people aged from 6 to 60 working on the figures, and Gormley felt that the involvement of three generations of a family should be continued in all the subsequent versions.

Gormley has also made several other works entitled ''Field'', but these are smaller groups of life size figures more typical of Gormley's earlier work.

In 1994, Gormley won the [[Turner prize]] with a collection of his work, including ''Field for the British Isles'', shown at the [[Tate Gallery]].

'''George Him''', (4 August 1900 – 4 April 1982), was a Polish born British designer responsible for a number of notable posters, book illustrations and advertising campaigns for a wide range of clients.

==Biography==
Him was born '''Jerzy Himmelfarb''' in 1900 to  a Polish-Jewish family in [[Lodz]], which was then in the [[Russian Empire]] and is now in Poland.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After  schooling and further education  in [[Warsaw]] Him studied Roman Law in Moscow but left in 1917 when the [[Russian Revolution]] forced the closure of the university he was attending. He moved to [[Bonn]] and by 1924 had completed a PhD at the [[University of Bonn]] on the comparative history of religions before deciding to study graphic art in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Him studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Art but even before he graduated in 1928 was already undertaking commercial commissions.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; Him returned to Poland where, in 1933, he changed his name and also established a design partnership with [[Jan Le Witt]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Slocombe|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014|title=British Posters of the Second World War |ISBN=978-1-904897-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as Lewitt-Him, the two established a distinctive design style which combined cubist and surrealist elements, often in a humorous context.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Their most notable work in Poland were illustrations for an experimental poetry group known as ''Skamander''.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;
[[File:Think Ahead Art.IWMPST8414.jpg|thumb|''Think Ahead Telegraph and Telephone Less'' (Art.IWM PST 8414) (1944) by LeWitt-Him for the [[General Post Office|GPO]] ]]

Him and Le Witt worked together in Poland for several years before, in 1937, they relocated the Lewitt-Him design business to London, following an exhibition of their work there by the publishers Lund Humphries. The pair quickly gained commercial contracts with [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] and [[Imperial Airways]] as well as illustrating children's books, such as ''The Little Red Engine Gets a Name'' (1942) by [[Diana Ross (author)|Diana Ross]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; In London during [[World War II]] the partnership received notable commissions for information and public safety posters from, among others, the [[General Post Office]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;

Him was naturalized as a British citizen in 1948 and the Lewitt-Him partnership enjoyed great success. Notable commissions included designing the giant umbrella tree for the Wet Weather section of the 1946 ''Britain Can Make It'' exhibition, the [[Guinness]] clock tower for [[Battersea Park]] Pleasure Gardens and murals for the Education Pavilion of the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/george-him |title=George Him|date= |accessdate=1 December 2017|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewitt-Him partnership was dissolved in 1954, when Le Witt decided to focus on developing his abstract paintings and artworks. Him continued to work as a commercial designer. Among the advertising campaigns he illustrated was the 1950s ''Schweppeshire'' campaign for the [[Schweppes]] drinks company.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Him's other clients numbered several airlines, including [[Pan-American Airways]], [[El Al]] and [[American Overseas Airlines]] plus the publishers of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; He continued to illustrate books but also designed exhibition stands, such as the Australia stand at the 1960 [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] and large window displays, notably for the [[De Bijenkorf]] store in [[Rotterdam]] and the 1961 Christmas windows for the [[Design Centre]] in London.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt;

From 1969 until 1977, Him taught graphic design at [[Leicester Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Him was an active artist up until the very end of his life. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held, one in 1976 at the [[London College of Printing]] and another in 1978 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; In 1977 Him was awarded the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award and in 1978 became a [[Royal Designer for Industry]].&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt;

{{Hermeticism}}

The '''''Hermetica''''' are [[Egypt]]ian-[[Greece|Greek]] [[Wisdom literature|wisdom texts]] from the 2nd century AD and later, which are mostly presented as [[Plato#The dialogues|dialogues]] in which a teacher, generally identified as [[Hermes Trismegistus]] ("thrice-greatest [[Hermes]]"), [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightens]] a disciple. The texts form the basis of [[Hermeticism]]. They discuss the [[Divinity|divine]], the [[cosmos]], [[mind]], and [[nature]]. Some touch upon [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and related concepts.

==Scope==
The term particularly applies to the '''''Corpus Hermeticum''''', [[Marsilio Ficino]]'s Latin translation in fourteen tracts, of which eight [[incunabulum|early printed]] editions appeared before 1500 and a further twenty-two by 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[George Sarton]], review of [[Walter Scott (scholar)|Walter Scott]]'s ''Hermetica'', ''Isis'' '''8'''.2 (May 1926:343-346) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, which includes ''[[Poimandres]]'' and some addresses of Hermes to disciples Tat, Ammon and Asclepius, was said to have originated in the school of [[Ammonius Saccas]] and to have passed through the keeping of [[Michael Psellus]]: it is preserved in fourteenth century manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The last three tracts in modern editions were translated independently from another manuscript by Ficino's contemporary [[Lodovico Lazzarelli]] (1447–1500) and first printed in 1507. Extensive quotes of similar material are found in classical authors such as [[Joannes Stobaeus]].

Parts of the ''Hermetica'' appeared in the 4th-century Gnostic library found in [[Nag Hammadi]]. Other works in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and other languages may also be termed ''Hermetica'' — another famous tract is the ''[[Emerald Tablet]]'', which teaches the doctrine "as above, so below".

All these are themselves remnants of a more extensive literature, part of the [[syncretism|syncretic]], intellectualized paganism of their era, a cultural movement that also included the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic philosophy]] of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and late [[Orpheus|Orphic]] and [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] literature and influenced [[Gnosticism|Gnostic forms]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]]. There are significant differences:&lt;ref&gt;[[Roel van den Broek|Broek, Roelof Van Den]]. "Gnosticism and Hermitism in Antiquity: Two Roads to Salvation." In Broek, Roelof Van Den, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff. 1998. ''Gnosis and Hermeticism From Antiquity to Modern Times.'' Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hermetica are little concerned with [[Greek mythology]] or the technical minutiae of metaphysical [[Neoplatonism]]. The Hermetica are heavily influenced by [[Judaism]] and explicitly refer to Genesis 1:28.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Everett. Backgrounds of early Christianity. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003: pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver, Brian P. Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a new English translation, with notes and introduction. Cambridge University Press, 1995: pg. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However most of these schools do agree in attributing the creation of the world to a [[Demiurge]] rather than the supreme being&lt;ref&gt;Anon, ''Hermetica – a new translation'', Pembridge Design Studio Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and in accepting [[reincarnation]]. Although [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosophers, who quote apocryphal works of [[Orpheus]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Pythagoras]] and other figures, almost never cite [[Hermes Trismegistus]], the tracts were still popular enough in the 5th century to be argued against by [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ls.poly.edu/~jbain/mms/texts/mmsaugustine.htm vii.23&amp;ndash;26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and antiquity==
The extant Egyptian-Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend pagan religious practices, such as the veneration of images. Their concerns are practical in nature, their end is a spiritual rebirth through the enlightenment of the mind:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing within myself an immaterial vision that came from the mercy of God, I went out of myself into an immortal body, and now I am not what I was before. I have been born in mind!&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Hermeticum'' XIII.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While they are difficult to date with precision, the texts of the ''Corpus'' were likely redacted between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. During the Renaissance these texts were believed to be of ancient Egyptian origin and even today some readers believe them to date from [[ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]]. Since [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] dwelt upon the great antiquity of the Egyptian teachings upon which the philosopher purported to draw, scholars were willing to accept that these texts were the sources of Greek ideas. However the classical scholar [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614) successfully argued that some, mainly those dealing with philosophy, betrayed too recent a vocabulary. Hellenisms in the language itself point to a Greek-era origin. However, flaws in this dating were discerned by the 17th century scholar Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of [[alchemy]] clothed in philosophical metaphor. And one text, the ''Asclepius'', lost in Greek but partially preserved in Latin, contained a bloody prophecy of the end of Roman rule in Egypt and the resurgence of pagan Egyptian power. Thus, it would be fair to assess the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as intellectually eclectic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granta.demon.co.uk/arsm/jg/corpus.html Secretum secretorum – An Overview of Magic in the Greco-Roman World]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research, while affirming the late dating in a period of [[Syncretism|syncretic]] cultural ferment in Roman Egypt, suggests more continuity with the culture of Pharaonic Egypt than had previously been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, Garth, The Egyptian Hermes : a historical approach to the late pagan mind (Cambridge/New York : Cambridge University Press), 1986&lt;/ref&gt; There are many parallels with Egyptian prophecies and hymns to the gods but the closest comparisons can be found in Egyptian [[wisdom literature]], which is characteristically couched in words of advice from a "father" to a "son".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Pierre Mahé]], "Preliminary Remarks on the Demotic "Book of Thoth" and the Greek Hermetica" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''50'''.4 (1996:353-363) p.358f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] (late Egyptian) [[Papyrus|papyri]] contain substantial sections of a dialogue of Hermetic type between Thoth and a disciple.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Jasnow and Karl-Th. Zausich, "A Book of Thoth?" (paper given at the 7th International Congress of Egyptologists: Cambridge, 3–9 September 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptologist [[Flinders Petrie|Sir William Flinders Petrie]] states that some texts in the Hermetic corpus date back to the 6th century BC during the Persian period.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical References in the Hermetic writings," Transactions of the Third International Congress of the History of Religions. Oxford I (1908) pp. 196-225 and Personal Religion in Egypt before Christianity. New York: Harpers (1909) pp. 85-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between the Demotic texts and Platonic philosophy could be the result of Plato and his followers' having drawn on Egyptian sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Bernal|Bernal, Martin]], "Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization", volume I, p. 465. n. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1996/96.04.05.html Martin Bernal's review of Mary Lefkowitz' "Not Out of Africa" (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
Many hermetic texts were lost to [[Western culture]] during the [[Middle Ages]] but rediscovered in Byzantine copies and popularized in [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]]. The impetus for this revival came from the [[Latin]] translation by [[Marsilio Ficino]], a member of the [[Cosimo de' Medici|de' Medici]] [[court (royal)|court]], who published a collection of thirteen tractates in 1471, as ''De potestate et sapientia Dei''.&lt;ref&gt;Among the treasures of the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam is this ''Corpus Hermeticum'' as published in 1471.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hermetica'' provided a seminal impetus in the development of Renaissance thought and culture, having a profound impact on [[alchemy]] and modern magic as well as influencing philosophers such as [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], Ficino's student. This influence continued as late as the 17th century with authors such as Sir [[Thomas Browne]].

Although the most famous examples of Hermetic literature were products of [[Greek language|Greek]]-speakers under Roman rule, the genre did not suddenly stop with the fall of the Empire but continued to be produced in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine Greek]]. The most famous example of this later Hermetica is the ''Emerald Tablet'', known from medieval Latin and Arabic manuscripts with a possible Syriac source. Little else of this rich literature is easily accessible to non-specialists. The mostly gnostic [[Nag Hammadi Library]], discovered in 1945, also contained one previously unknown hermetic text called ''[[The Ogdoad and the Ennead]]'', a description of a hermetic initiation into gnosis that has led to new perspectives on the nature of Hermetism as a whole, particularly due to the research of [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, ''Hermès en Haute Egypte'' 2 vols. (Quebec) 1978, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard editions==
[[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]]'s historically important 1650 translation into [[English language|English]] of the ''Corpus Hermeticum'', entitled ''The Divine Pymander in XVII books'' (London, 1650) was from Ficino's Latin translation; it is no longer considered reliable by scholars. The modern standard editions are the Budé edition by A. D. Nock and A.-J. Festugière (Greek and French, 1946, repr. 1991) and Brian P. Copenhaver (English, 1992).

{{Nihongo||秘仏|'''Hibutsu'''|extra="hidden Buddhas"}} are [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] [[icon]]s or statues concealed from public view. ''Hibutsu'' are generally located within Buddhist temples in shrines called {{Nihongo||厨子|''zushi''|extra="miniature shrines"}}. They are generally unavailable for viewing or worship, although they are brought out for specific religious ceremonies; it is also possible in some cases for the ''hibutsu'' to be viewed in exchange for an offering to the temple. Certain ''hibutsu'', such as the wooden statue of [[Gautama Buddha]] at [[Seiryō-ji]] or the [[Amitābha|Amida]] statuary at [[Zenkō-ji]], are almost never displayed, even to initiates of the temples in which they are held (such examples are known as ''zettai hibutsu'').&lt;ref name=Suzuki&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suzuki |first1=Michitaka |title=Hibutsu (Hidden Buddha): Living Images in Japan and the Orthodox Icons |url=http://ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/file/44671/rpkp_017_005_024.pdf |publisher=University of Okayama |accessdate=28 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205031053/http://ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp/file/44671/rpkp_017_005_024.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are put on public display only rarely, in a ceremony called {{Nihongo||開帳|''kaichō''|extra="opening the curtain"}}.&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rambelli|first1=Fabio|title=Secret Buddhas: The Limits of Buddhist Representation|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=Autumn 2002|volume=57|issue=3|jstor=3096768|pages=271–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Whilst the practice of concealing important religious artefacts within ''zushi'' or behind curtains dates to the [[Heian period]], the concept of ''hibutsu'' is slightly later. It is possible that the original practice was based on [[Shinto]] concepts, in which {{Nihongo||神|''[[kami]]''|extra="gods"}} are without physical form,&lt;ref name="Plutschow2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Plutschow|title=Matsuri: The Festivals of Japan: With a Selection from P.G. O'Neill's Photographic Archive of Matsuri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X_7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-24698-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a document from [[Kōryū-ji]] indicates that it began at that temple with the concealment of a statue of [[Guanyin|Kannon]] imported from [[Silla]] in 616 C.E. The earliest record of an actual ''hibutsu'' dates from 1106, when sources indicate the Amida statues at Zenkō-ji were briefly put on display. By the [[Edo period]] ''hibutsu'' had become a popular concept in Japanese Buddhism, and during this time ''kaichō'' ceremonies became major public events, drawing crowds of thousands.&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002/&gt; It has been noted by art historians such as Shiro Ito that ''hibutsu'' are a uniquely Japanese phenomenon; other Buddhist cultures do not have any equivalent practice.&lt;ref name=Suzuki/&gt;

The concealment of the ''hibutsu'' is intended to emphasise their potency and transcendence.&lt;ref name="ScheidTeeuwen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bernhard Scheid|author2=Mark Teeuwen|title=The Culture of Secrecy in Japanese Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Lk7lt70qDcC&amp;pg=PA255|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-16874-3|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve to protect them from pollution by the impure influences of the mundane world,&lt;ref name=Rambelli2002/&gt; or to preserve the personal privacy of these "living" embodiments of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Suzuki/&gt;

[[Liza Dalby]]'s novel ''Hidden Buddhas'' is based on the concept of ''hibutsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sato|first1=Hiroaki|title=Chaos will reign if hidden Buddhas die|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2010/06/06/books/book-reviews/chaos-will-reign-if-hidden-buddhas-die/#.VHhuWNKsV8E|date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IndieBound''' is a marketing movement for independent bookstores launched in 2008 by the [[American Booksellers Association]]. With resources targeted for "indie" booksellers, it promotes [[fiscal localism]]. IndieBound's curated reading lists include the Indie Next List (indie recommendations from around the country) and the Indie Bestseller List (bestsellers lists based on indie store sales).

== Launch ==
IndieBound was launched in June 2008 to replace a prior marketing program for independents called Book Sense. Independent bookstores sell online through their own e-commerce sites, many using the ABA IndieCommerce platform. IndieBound.org is store referral site for customers searching for an independent bookstore. 

Following its launch, the US scheme was expanded to the UK, New Zealand and Australia. However, as of 2015 the Australian version appears to be in abeyance, as despite still having a [[Twitter account]], the linked website is unrelated and the Australian Booksellers Association website makes no mention of it.

== Indie Bestseller Lists ==
The Indie Bestseller Lists show the top selling titles in independent bookstores nationwide.

Indie Bestseller Lists are published weekly for hardcover fiction, hardcover nonfiction, trade paperback fiction, trade paperback nonfiction, mass market paperback, "children's interest," children's illustrated, and children's fiction series. Category lists, which focus on a particular genre, are published less frequently. The Indie Bestseller Lists are released by IndieBound as XML feeds.

== Indie Next Lists ==
Before a major new book is published, the publisher will often send out [[advance copy|advance reading copies]] (ARCs, or uncorrected proofs) to booksellers to generate interest in the book. Owners and employees of ABA member stores review these ARCs, along with brand-new books when they are released, and nominate their favorites as an Indie Next List great read. The American Booksellers Association handles nominations and voting, and releases monthly lists of what member stores have selected. There are special pick lists from time to time.

== Indies Choice Book Awards ==
Each year, owners and employees of ABA stores have the opportunity to vote for the [[Indies Choice Book Awards]], which is issued in four categories. The winning authors are honored at a banquet at [[BookExpo America]].

The '''James Sewell Ballet''' is a [[Minneapolis, MN|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]-based ballet company of eight dancers founded in 1990 by James Sewell and Sally Rousse.

==History==
James Sewell Ballet (JSB) was founded in 1990 by James Sewell and Sally Rousse in New York City. In 1992, Sewell and Rousse moved the company to Minneapolis, Minnesota, Sewell’s hometown, where it has since resided for nearly two decades.

==Company==
'''James Sewell'''
Sewell is the Artistic Director and co-founder of James Sewell Ballet.  After moving to New York, Sewell trained at the School of American Ballet, where he performed with ABT II.  Sewell was a lead dancer with [[Feld Ballets/NY]] for six years, and has performed as a guest artist with New York City Ballet and Denishawn.  While in New York, Sewell joined forces with co-founder Sally Rousse to create James Sewell Ballet.  Sewell has since choreographed over 70 ballets for James Sewell Ballet and other companies world-wide.

'''Sally Rousse'''
Rousse began dancing in Barre, Vermont. She trained at the School of American Ballet and with David Howard before performing as a leading dancer with Ballet Chicago, the Royal Ballet of Flanders, and James Sewell Ballet. In 2001, Rousse was awarded a McKnight Artist Fellowship for Dancers.  She was also named a [[City Pages]] "Artist of the Year" in 2009 for her work in the Minneapolis dance community.  In addition to her work with James Sewell Ballet, Rousse also works as an independent choreographer in the Minneapolis area.

==Community Outreach==
Over the past few years, JSB has undertaken a series of outreach initiatives to integrate audiences into its programmatic events.

===SmArts Program===
	The SmArts – School Performance Curriculum program, developed with educational consultant Mitchell Korn, is James Sewell Ballet’s community dance education program for elementary and middle school students.  Serving 7,000-8,000 students annually, the SmArts program concentrates on the four life lessons of Communication, Coordination, Cooperation, and Discipline through an interactive dance demonstration and lecture program.

===First Chance Dance===
	JSB’s First Chance Dance Program offers reduced-price mainstage performances to families with young children.  These programs consist of an informal, 60-minute Saturday morning showing that provides young audiences an introduction to the dance community.

In addition to these programs, James Sewell Ballet also emphasizes mentorship activities with local dance students as part of its residency activities.

==Repertory==
The majority of works performed by James Sewell Ballet are the choreography of artistic director James Sewell.  Since 1990, James Sewell Ballet has performed over 70 of Sewell’s works.  Sewell and the JSB dancers work mostly in the contemporary ballet idiom, which incorporates the disciplines of classical ballet, modern, and jazz dance.  In accordance with its tagline “Sometimes controversial, sometimes funny, always innovative,” Sewell’s work is known for its frequent inclusion of satire and social commentary.

===Ballet Works Project===
In addition to Sewell’s choreography, the company also performs the work of other selected choreographers as part of its annual Ballet Works Project concert.  For the past sixteen years, the Ballet Works Project has been a collaboration between emerging and established choreographers and James Sewell Ballet.  The goal of this project is to provide artists a liberal space for exploration and discovery in dance, with the JSB dancers as their canvas.  Each year, the dancers choose the choreographers for the Ballet Works Project.  Past participants have included JSB company members (other than Sewell), as well as a myriad of local and national talents.  Since 2009, JSB’s Winter season concerts have been devoted to performances of the Ballet Works Project.

'''Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t|r|ə}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sartre "Sartre"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|saʁtʁ|lang}}; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]]. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of [[existentialist|existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and one of the leading figures in [[Twentieth-Century French Philosophy|20th-century French philosophy]] and [[Marxism]]. His work has also influenced [[sociology]], [[critical theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], and [[literary studies]], and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his [[open relationship]] with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the [[culture|cultural]] and [[society|social]] assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered [[bourgeois]], in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] (''mauvaise foi'', literally, "[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]") and an "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]" way of "[[being]]" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'Être et le Néant'', 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N.  |title=The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-55663-8 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work ''[[Existentialism and Humanism]]'' (''L'existentialisme est un humanisme'', 1946), originally presented as a lecture.

He was awarded the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".&lt;ref&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1964).

==Biography==

===Early life===

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in [[Paris]] as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the [[French Navy]], and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer).&lt;ref name="Baird1999"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Forrest E.

When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in [[Indochina]]. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in [[Meudon]], where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to [[classics|classical literature]] at a very early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brabazon |first=James |title=Albert Schweitzer: A Biography |year=1975 |publisher=Putnam |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to [[La Rochelle]], where he was frequently bullied.&lt;ref&gt;''Jean-Paul Sartre'', by Andrew N. Leak, (London 2006), page 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[essay]] ''[[Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jean-Paul |first1=Sartre |author2=Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre, Jonathan Webber |title=The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination |origyear=1940 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28755-3 |pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Cours Hattemer]], a private school in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Quelques Anciens Celebres – Hattemar}} |url=http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/# |title=Quelques Anciens Celebres |publisher=Hattemer |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618133955/http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/ |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) in Paris at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Schrift"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrift |first=Alan D. |editor= |others= |title=Twentieth-century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=1-4051-3217-5 |pages=174–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (His 1928 MA thesis under the title "L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature" ["Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature"] was supervised by [[Henri Delacroix]].)&lt;ref name="Schrift"/&gt; It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs: fifty years of political reflection'', By Raymond Aron (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s seminars, which continued for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Auffret, D. (2002), Alexandre Kojeve. La philosophie, l'Etat, la fin de l'histoire, Paris: B. Grasset&lt;/ref&gt;

From his first years in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]], Sartre was one of its fiercest [[prank]]sters.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''], p.,53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''], pp. 61–2 quote: "During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, his [[antimilitarist]] [[satirical]] cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with [[Georges Canguilhem]], particularly upset the director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''], pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; he organized a [[media prank]] following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including ''[[Le Petit Parisien]],'' announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh [[look-alike]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''], pp.69, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/sartre.shtml |title=Jeanj.m.m.,n,mnn-Paul Sartre – philosopher, social advocate |publisher=Tameri.com |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public's resultant outcry{{Request quotation|date=May 2011}} forced Lanson to resign.&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuL98MtZ5poC&amp;pg=PA26 ''Sartre'' by David Drake, 2005], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 at the École Normale, he met [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship,&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Humphrey |title=The People Magazine approach to a literary supercouple |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=20 November 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |date=28 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231192609/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |archivedate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Liliane  |title=In the shadow of Sartre |year=1990 |publisher=Collins (London) |isbn=0-00-215336-X |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Sartre took the [[agrégation]], he failed.  He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Desan, ''The Tragic Finale: An Essay on the Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1960) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Bair, ''Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography'' (New York: Touchstone Book, 1990), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre was drafted into the [[French Army]] from 1929 to 1931 and served as a meteorologist for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, ''Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963'' (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le Sueur |first1=James D. |author2=Pierre Bourdieu |title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria |origyear=2005 |year= 2005|publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-8028-9 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various [[lycées]] of [[Le Havre]] (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée François-Ier (Le Havre)|fr}}, 1931–36), [[Laon]] (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]], 1937–39, and at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], 1941–44;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]] (ed.), ''Jean-Paul Sartre'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[#World War II|below]]).

In 1932, Sartre discovered ''[[Voyage au bout de la nuit]]'' by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], a book that had a remarkable influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''La Force de l'âge'', Gallimard, 1960, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the [[Institut Français|Institut français d'Allemagne]] in [[Berlin]] where he studied [[Edmund Husserl]]'s phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s ''Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl'' (''The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology'').&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, "Merleau-Ponty vivant", in ''Situations, IV: portraits'', Gallimard, 1964, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army, where he served as a [[meteorologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van den Hoven |first1=Adrian |author2=Andrew N. Leak |others=Andrew N. Leak |title=Sartre Today: A Centenary Celebration |year=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=1-84545-166-X |pages=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by German troops in 1940 in [[Padoux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boulé |first=Jean-Pierre  |title=Sartre, Self-formation, and Masculinities |year=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-742-5 |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he spent nine months as a [[prisoner of war]]—in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and finally in {{Interlanguage link multi|Stalag XII-D|fr}}, [[Trier]], where he wrote his first [[theatre|theatrical]] piece, ''Barionà, fils du tonnerre'', a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'', later to become a major influence on his own essay on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[ontology]]. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and [[exotropia]] affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakewell |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Bakewell |date=2016 |title=At the Existentialist Café |publisher=Chatto&amp;Windus |page=158 |isbn=9781473545328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris, settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position at Lycée Condorcet in Paris, replacing a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by [[Statute on Jews|Vichy law]].

After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group ''Socialisme et Liberté'' ("Socialism and Liberty") with other writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Dominique Desanti]], Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with "cheerful ferocity" at a meeting that the ''Socialisme et Liberté'' assassinate prominent war collaborators like [[Marcel Déat]], but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as "none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=218}} The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General [[Otto von Stülpnagel]], and the popular slogan always was "Death to Laval!" rather than "Death to Hitler!".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=225}} In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of [[André Gide]] and [[André Malraux]]. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. ''Socialisme et liberté'' soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', ''[[The Flies]]'', and ''[[No Exit]]'', none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay "Paris under the Occupation", Sartre wrote about the "correct" behavior of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark "We could not be ''natural''".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=57-58}} French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Ousby wrote: "But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Sartre wrote the very "correctness" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the "correct" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the "New Order in Europe", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}

Throughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre wrote about the "languid existence" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing about how: "Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} Sartre also remarked on conversations at the [[Café de Flore]] between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a ''[[wiktionary:mouche|mouche]]'' (informer) or a writer of the ''[[wiktionary:corbeau|corbeau]]'' (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no-one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=148}} Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the ''Abwehr'' alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as ''mouches'' while by 1942 the Paris ''Kommandantur'' was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the ''corbeaux''.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=146}}

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a "sham", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=161}} Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris "was peopled by the absent".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=172}} Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing about how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the ''concierge'' forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre wrote the ''feldgrau'' ("field grey") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called "a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=170}} Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans ''les autres'' ("the others"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play ''Huis clos'' ("No Exit") of "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" ("Hell is other people").{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}} Sartre intended the line  "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}}

After August 1944 and the [[Liberation of Paris]], he wrote ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]''. In the book he tries to explain the [[etiology]] of "hate" by analyzing [[antisemitic|antisemitic hate]]. Sartre was a very active contributor to ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', a newspaper created during the clandestine period by [[Albert Camus]], a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''. Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant [[Vladimir Jankelevitch]] criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the [[rue Bonaparte]] which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political [[review]], ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' (''Modern Times''), in part to popularize his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, ''Les Chemins de la Liberté'' (''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'') (1945–1949).

===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===

The first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by ''Being and Nothingness'' (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the ''résistants'' were a "band of brothers" who had enjoyed "real freedom" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} Sartre was "merciless" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer [[Robert Brasillach]] from being executed.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} His 1948 play ''Les mains sales'' (''[[Dirty Hands]]'') in particular explored the problem of being a politically "engaged"  intellectual. He embraced [[Marxism]] but did not join the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as "provincial" and in a 1949 essay called for a "United States of Europe".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29}} In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal ''Politique étrangère'', Sartre wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29-30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the Korean War, Sartre wrote: "I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=34}} In July 1950, Sartre wrote in ''Les Temps Modernes'' about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a "revolutionary" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of "bourgeois" states were due to their innate shortcomings.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} The Swiss journalist [[François Bondy]] wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews "a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges "may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power", deeming Sartre's position to be "existentialist".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

While a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a "complete freedom of criticism" while condemning the United States for sinking into "prefascism".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=28}} Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union "still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=41}} He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: "In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=37}}  Sartre came to admire the Polish leader [[Władysław Gomułka]], a man who favored a "Polish road to socialism" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Sartre's newspaper ''Les Temps Modernes'' devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's "ultra Bolshevism" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] as the man who lead the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}}

As an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in the [[Algerian War]] and was one of the signatories of the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]''. Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s.&lt;ref&gt;István Mészáros, ''The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom and the Challenge of History,'' rev. ed. (New York: Monthly Review, 2012), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and, along with [[Bertrand Russell]] and others, organized a [[tribunal]] intended to expose U.S. [[war crimes]], which became known as the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 1967.

His work after Stalin's death, the ''Critique de la raison dialectique'' (''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the ''Critique'' Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of "class" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, [[Louis Althusser]], who claimed that the ideas of the [[young Marx]] were decisively superseded by the "scientific" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the "real damned of the earth", who would carry out the revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=27-28}} A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the "Americanization" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

Sartre went to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s to meet [[Fidel Castro]] and spoke with [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10/9/2006 |title="Remembering Che Guevara", 9 October 2006, '&amp;#39;The International News'&amp;#39;, by Prof Khwaja Masud |work=The News International |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112210219/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10%2F9%2F2006 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "era's most perfect man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1920888241 |title=Amazon Review of: 'The Bolivian Diary: Authorized Edition' |publisher=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that "he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html HeyChe.org – People about Che Guevara]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709042917/http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: "In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Conducta Impropria by [[Nestor Almendros]], 1983: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQB5cI9b4A&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLD12AFBD33DDE5D99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited [[Red Army Faction]] leader [[Andreas Baader]] in [[Stammheim Prison]] and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1974/baader.htm |title=The Slow Death of Andreas Baader |publisher=Marxists.org |date=7 December 1974 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, Sartre became an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref name="nybooks4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4 |title=Sartre at Seventy: An Interview by Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Contat |work=The New York Review of Books |date=7 August 1975 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raforum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |title=R.A.

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, ''Les Mots'' (''[[The Words (book)|The Words]]''). The book is an ironic counterblast to [[Marcel Proust]], whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of [[André Gide]] (who had provided the model of ''littérature engagée'' for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize,&lt;ref&gt;

Though his name was then a household word (as was "existentialism" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 strikes]] in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for [[civil disobedience]]. President [[Charles de Gaulle]] intervened and pardoned him, commenting that "you don't arrest [[Voltaire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF1538F934A35755C0A961948260 "Superstar of the Mind"], by Tom Bishop in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 7 June 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir grave, Montparnasse, Paris, France-16June2009.jpg|thumb|Sartre's and de Beauvoir's grave in the [[Cimetière de Montparnasse]]]]
In 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like &lt;nowiki&gt;[people]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remember ''Nausea'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[my plays]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''No Exit'' and ''The Devil and the Good Lord,'' and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. Then my essay on [[Jean Genet|Genet]], ''Saint Genet''. ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charlesworth  |first=Max  |title=The Existentialists and Jean-Paul Sartre |year=1976 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |isbn=0-7022-1150-8 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of [[amphetamine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Criterion review of La Cérémonie des adieux by Simone de Beauvoir|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-last-days-of-Jean-Paul-Sartre-6523}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put himself through during the writing of the ''Critique'' and a massive analytical biography of [[Gustave Flaubert]] (''The Family Idiot''), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hayman. ''Sartre: A Biography.'' Carroll &amp; Graf, 1992, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious [[chain smoker]], which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|title=Hell is other people removing your cigarette|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1485353/Hell-is-other-people-removing-your-cigarette.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from [[edema]] of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]] between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto Boulevard Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histoire Du Monde|url=http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Jean-Paul-Sartre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat-2000-Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080602061137/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 June 2008 |title=Sartre's Roads to Freedom |last=Singer |first=Daniel |date=5 June 2000 |work=The Nation |accessdate=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral started at "the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie. ''Sartre: A Life.'' Random House, Inc., 1987, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie, p. 523.

==Thought==
{{See also|Being and Nothingness}}
Sartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are "condemned to be free".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: "existence precedes essence".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"/&gt; This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. "We are left alone, without excuse." "We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8181406/Does_our_past_have_a_motivational_effect_Our_reasons_for_acting_Sartre_s_philosophy_of_action |title=Does our past have a motivational effect? Our reasons for acting: Sartre's philosophy of action. |author=[[Yoann Malinge]] |date= |website=[[Academia.edu]] |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience "death consciousness" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Death. (1999). In Gordon Hayim (Ed.) Dictionary of Existentialism (p. 105). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.

As a junior lecturer at the Lycée du [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (''Nausea''), which serves in some ways as a [[manifesto]] of [[existentialism]] and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the [[Husserl|German]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.

He also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: "Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | volume = 55 | issue = 3&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This indifference of "things in themselves" (closely linked with the later notion of "being-in-itself" in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the "nausea" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.

The novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that [[morality]] is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying "Condemned to be free") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.

Also important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; "When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yoann Malinge, ''"Sartre, « The Transcendance of the Ego »"'' (The Literary Encyclopedia: https://www.academia.edu/31648622/_Sartre_The_Transcendance_of_the_Ego_article_in_The_Literary_Encyclopedia_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as public intellectual==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] Memorial]]
While the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45.&lt;ref&gt;Baert 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: "Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined &lt;nowiki&gt;[with]&lt;/nowiki&gt; women. He wrote. And he was published."&lt;ref&gt;Gerassi 1989: 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where "the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out".&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir 1958: 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in ''[[The Age of Reason (Sartre)|The Age of Reason]]'', which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute [[rationalist]], analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could "recognize no allegiance except to [him]self",&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 13&lt;/ref&gt; though he realized that without "responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.

The war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: "the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 108&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the "Socialisme et Liberté" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, Ronald (2004). ''Camus &amp; Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel That Ended It''. University of Chicago Press. p. 30. {{ISBN|0-226-02796-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-02796-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this "crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature".&lt;ref&gt;Thody 1964: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

Sartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, "culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention." This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work "subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: "the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: 13&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its "authoritarian tendencies". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: "If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist."&lt;ref name="nybooks4"/&gt; He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.&lt;ref name="raforum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which "reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there".&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the "traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior", but there is "a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran|Oran, Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line "L'enfer, c'est les autres", usually translated as "Hell is other people."&lt;ref name="rickontheater"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |title= The Most Famous Thing Jean-Paul Sartre Never Said |last1=Woodward |first1=Kirk|date=9 July 2010 |work=Rick on Theater |publisher=Blogger (Google: blogspot.com) |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the impact of ''Nausea'', Sartre's major work of fiction was ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]].

[[John Huston]] got Sartre to script his film ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Le Scénario'', 10; Scenario. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits.&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth. ''Jacques Lacan &amp; Co: A History of Psychoanalysis in France, 1925–1985''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asharperfocus.com/Freud.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] placed Sartre's oeuvre on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (List of Prohibited Books)]].

==Criticism==
Some philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[Reification (fallacy)|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophers [[Richard Wollheim]] and [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=7 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals associated with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]] allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Brian C. Anderson]] denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and Castro's regime in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership:  "The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, "[http://www.fortfreedom.org/h11.htm The Heartless Lovers of Humankind]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre, who stated in his preface to [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' that, "To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man," has been criticized by Anderson and [[Michael Walzer]] for supporting the killing of European civilians by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] during the [[Algerian War]]. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6476 The Absolute Intellectual] Brian C. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 Can There Be a Decent Left?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118221640/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 |date=18 November 2011 }} {{website=Kenyon.edu |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Waltzer.htm |date=18 November 2011 }} Michael Walzer&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic, poet, essayist and philosopher [[Clive James]] excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies ''[[Cultural Amnesia (book)|Cultural Amnesia]]'' (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being "all a pose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/clives_lives/2007/03/jeanpaul_sartre.html|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|first=Clive|last=James|date=29 March 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Jōmon Venus'''|縄文のビーナス|Jōmon no Bīnasu}} is a ''[[dogū]]'', a humanoid clay female figurine from the Middle [[Jōmon period]] (3,000–2,000&amp;nbsp;BC),&lt;ref name="JACA_201_10063"&gt;{{cite web|language=Japanese|publisher= Agency for Cultural Affairs|url=http://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/bemaindetails.asp?register_id=201&amp;item_id=10063|script-title=土偶|trans-title=Dogū|access-date= 29 November 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered in 1986 in [[Chino, Nagano|Chino]], [[Nagano Prefecture]], Japan. It was designated a [[National Treasure (Japan)|National Treasure]] in 1995, the first Jōmon-period artifact to be so designated.&lt;ref name="JACA_201_10063" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en" /&gt;

The ''[[dogū]]'' is an ocher-colored clay statuette {{convert|27|cm|abbr=on}} high and weighing {{convert|2.14|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en" /&gt;  The clay from which it is made has been carefully polished and contains [[mica]].&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en" /&gt; Its shape is thought to resemble a pregnant woman: broad hips, a pronounced gluteal arch, prominent breasts and an enlarged belly.&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en" /&gt; In contrast to the overwhelming majority of the 20,000 ''dogū'' found in Japan, which were fragmented, the Venus of Jōmon is complete and has all its limbs.&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en" /&gt;

== History ==
In 1986, archaeological excavations were organized before the construction of an industrial park in the town of Chino at the site of the former hamlet of Tanabatake, located at the foot of the southern slope of [[Mount Kirigamine]] in the [[Yatsugatake Mountains]], about {{convert|140|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Tokyo.&lt;ref name="JACA_201_10063" /&gt; This {{nihongo|Tanabatake archaeological site|棚畑遺跡|Tanabateke Iseki}} revealed the vestiges of a village of 149 houses, 146 of which date from the middle Jōmon period. The pieces of obsidian discovered at the site indicate that this village was a prosperous trading center. The figurine was found among the burial pits at the center of the excavation site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Japanese|publisher= Chino city, Jōmon project|script-title=棚畑遺跡|trans-title=Tanabatake archaeological site|year=2015|url=http://www.city.chino.lg.jp/www/contents/1448511805635/index.html|access-date=29 November 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first named the ''Tanabatake Venus'' before acquiring its present name.&lt;ref name="CBE_2016_en"&gt;{{cite web|publisher =Chino City Board of Education|title=National Treasure « Dogu » part 1: « Jomon no Venus » (the Venus of Jomon)|year=2016|url=http://www.city.chino.lg.jp/www/contents/1446544612482/index_k.html|website=www.city.chino.lg.jp|access-date= 29 November 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, it was designated an [[Important Cultural Property (Japan)|Important Cultural Property]] before achieving its current status. It is exhibited at the [[Togariishi Museum of Jōmon Archaeology]] in Chino.&lt;ref name="CCBE_2015_en" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15218">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of Disney references in ''Enchanted''}}
This is a '''list of Disney references''' made in the film '''''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'''''. ''Enchanted'' pays tribute to many [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films, both animated and [[live-action]], as well as other works produced by Disney. In an interview, director [[Kevin Lima]] said that there are "thousands"&lt;ref name="sciretta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-enchanted-visual-guide/ |title=The Enchanted Visual Guide |author=Peter Sciretta |date=2008-03-14 |work= |publisher=''Slashfilm'' |accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of specific details, scenes, actions and lines of dialogue that were purposely included as [[allusion]]s to earlier Disney films.&lt;ref name="manhattan"&gt;{{cite news |title='Enchanted' princess steps out of cartoon, into Manhattan |author=Susan Wloszczyna |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-11-22-enchanted-homage-side_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several actors from past Disney films have also made contributions in the film through either voice narration or [[Cameo appearance|on-screen appearances]].

== General ==
General references that allude to more than one Disney film are:

* The storybook opening of ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' is a tribute to the openings of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' and others. It would later be used in ''[[Disney's A Christmas Carol]]'' among others.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;
* Giselle's initial personality is based on multiple [[Disney Princess]]es; director Kevin Lima describes her as "about 80% [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]], with some traits borrowed from [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] and [[Aurora (Disney)|Sleeping Beauty]]... although her spunkiness comes from [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] of "''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''".&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;
* The troll's loincloth consists of remnants of the Disney princesses' dresses, Snow White's rags, Belle's village dress, Aurora's peasant dress, and Cinderella's maid outfit. Also, his earrings are the shells from [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]]'s bikini top.&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;
* The ballroom scene is a homage and a tender reference to the classical ballroom scenes from "Cinderella", " Sleeping Beauty" and "Beauty and the Beast."
* Mary Ilene Caselotti, the name of the news reporter, is a reference to [[Mary Costa]] (the voice of Aurora), [[Ilene Woods]] (the voice of Cinderella) and [[Adriana Caselotti]] (the voice of Snow White).&lt;ref name="kit"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kit |first1=Borys | last2=Giardina | first2=Carolyn | title='Enchanted' brings back old familiar feelings | newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=November 21, 2007 | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7a59816873ebe91a592908fbde36af88  | accessdate=2008-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The final [[Stage combat|fight scene]] at the top of [[Woolworth Building]] is an homage to similar climaxes in ''Sleeping Beauty'', ''The Little Mermaid'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;

== ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' ==
Specific references made to ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' include:

* Narissa disguises herself as a hag, just as the Evil Queen does.&lt;ref name="enchanted1"&gt;{{cite news |title='Enchanted' princess steps out of cartoon, into Manhattan |author=Susan Wloszczyna |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-11-14-enchanted_N.htm |newspaper=USA Today |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Narissa also poisons Giselle with an apple, which rolls away after Giselle falls much like it does when Snow White eats the poison apple.
* Giselle mistakes a [[Dwarfism|little person]] in [[New York City]] for the dwarf Grumpy.&lt;ref name="2007c"&gt;{{Citation | last=Wloszczyna | first=Susan | title=New Disney princess Giselle has an enchanting royal lineage | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=November 22, 2007c  | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-11-22-enchanted-homage_N.htm | accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Happy Working Song]]" is an homage to "[[Whistle While You Work]]".&lt;ref name="quint"&gt;{{Citation | last=Quint| first= | title=Quint dreams about Disney princesses with ENCHANTED director Kevin Lima | newspaper=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=December 14, 2007 | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35069 | accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prince Edward refers to the hotel television as a Magic Mirror.&lt;ref name="Hidden Disney in 'Enchanted'"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Disney in 'Enchanted'|url=http://the-moviebuff.blogspot.com/2008/01/hidden-disney-in-enchanted.html|work=The MovieBuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giselle cleans up Robert's apartment with the help of animals, similarly to how Snow White did it. 
* When Nathaniel hands Giselle the poisoned apple, the caramel covering it makes the same skull pattern seen on the poisoned apple in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''.
*Narissa is both an evil queen and a stepmother, just like the villain of ''Snow White''.
*Giselle looks through a pair of blue gems while constructing her dream man. One of the Seven Dwarfs in Snow White, Dopey, can be seen looking through a pair of gems as well.
* The law firm that Robert appears to work for is named after the composers of the music from [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)#Music|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']]: [[Frank Churchill]], [[Leigh Harline]], and [[Paul J. Smith (composer)|Paul J. Smith]].

== ''Cinderella'' ==
Specific references made to ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' include:
* Giselle's carriage looks similar to Cinderella's pumpkin carriage.&lt;ref name="Hidden Disney in 'Enchanted'"/&gt; 
* Giselle and Morgan mention fairy godmothers and their magic before midnight, just before they go out shopping.
* Robert mistakes Edward's name as 'Charming'- a reference to Prince Charming from ''Cinderella''.
* Giselle uses Robert's curtains and Morgan's rug to make her dresses, a reference to the dress that Cinderella's mice friends make for her from things that her stepsisters weren't using.&lt;ref name="2007c" /&gt;
* Giselle takes off her heels while pulling the sword out of the floor, going after the dragon. One slipper gets left behind and Nancy tries it on after encouragement from Prince Edward and it fits; - an obvious reference to Cinderella losing her slipper while escaping the castle. Also, the Prince found Cinderella, his true love by using the slipper on her foot, much like how Prince Edward found his true love by using Giselle's slipper on Nancy's foot.
* At the end of the film, in Giselle's shop, we see a mouse in a pink shoe being used to carry thread. This is similar to the scene in Cinderella where the mice are making Cinderella's pink ball gown.
* Nancy's last name is Tremaine, a reference to the surname of Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters.
* The effect of the poisoned apple and the effect of 'true love's kiss' is said to be vanished before midnight, that is, before the clock strikes twelve- a simple yet obvious reference of the magic of the Fairy Godmother which lasted till midnight.
* During the song "Happy Working Song", there is a scene where Giselle scrubs the floor and bubbles float everywhere and reflect her, just like Cinderella during the song "Sing Sweet Nightingale".

== ''The Little Mermaid'' ==
Specific references made to ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' include:

* [[Jodi Benson]] plays Robert's secretary, Sam; Benson voiced [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] in ''The Little Mermaid''.&lt;ref name="adler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1574092/enchanted-disney-spoofs-can-spot-them.jhtml |title='Enchanted' Disney Spoofs: Past Princesses, Familiar Restaurants, Cleaning Cockroaches |author=Shawn Adler |date=2007-11-13 |work= |publisher=''MTV.com'' |accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giselle sings to her dream prince, just as Ariel does with the statue of Eric.&lt;ref name="quint" /&gt;
* The Troll's earrings are made of the shell bra Ariel wears.&lt;ref name="manhattan" /&gt;
* As Giselle studies the fish tank at Robert's office, an instrumental version of "[[Part of Your World]]" is played in the background.&lt;ref name="2007c" /&gt;
* "[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]" is an homage to "[[Under the Sea]]" and "[[Kiss the Girl]]" through its calypso beat.&lt;ref name="2007c" /&gt;
* Narissa's lair is similar to [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]]'s lair.
* When Giselle leaves the shower, the birds give her a beige towel. The way the towel lies down on her when she accidentally falls on Robert during Nancy's visit is reminiscent of Ariel's attire mainly composed of beige cloth tied up by ropes.

== ''Mary Poppins'' ==
Specific references made to ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' include:

* The woman selling birdseed in the park says, "Feed the birds," like the Old Birdwoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Dinsey in 'Enchanted'|url=http://the-moviebuff.blogspot.com/2008/01/hidden-disney-in-enchanted.html|work=The MovieBuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The dancers in "That's How You Know" also played the chimney sweepers.
* Robert is working a divorce case for a woman with the surname of Banks.

== Other ==
References made to other Disney films and characters include: 
* Robert Phillip's personality shares traits with the strict George Banks from ''Mary Poppins'' and cynical Eddie Valiant from ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
* [[Judy Kuhn]] makes a cameo appearance as one of the residents in Robert's building (credited as "Pregnant Woman with Kids"); Kuhn provided the singing voice of [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]].&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite news |title='Enchanted' casts a familiar spell |author=Susan King |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/29/entertainment/et-enchanted29 |newspaper=''Los Angeles Times'' |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jodi Benson]] plays Robert's secretary, Sam; Benson provided the speaking and singing voice for [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]] in [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]], and voiced various Barbie dolls in the ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' series and Weebo from ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]''.&lt;ref name="adler"/&gt;
* The troll, while being flung into the next kingdom, does the [[Goofy holler]], heard in many other Disney films and shorts; this is a reference to [[Goofy]].&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/enchanted/ |title=Hidden Disney |author= |date=2007-11-15 |work= |publisher=''Empire'' |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The bus driver's hair is shaped like the ears of [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref name="sciretta" /&gt;
* Television clips watched by Prince Edward and Nathaniel in their hotel room&amp;nbsp;– according to director Kevin Lima, "Everything on the television comes from a Disney film. Every image: Disney's ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''; there's an image of Mortimer Snerd, a ventriloquist's dummy that comes from ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''. There's a lot of dialogue that plays in the background that is all Disney referenced as well. The Spanish dialogues were from the Latin American version of ''[[Mickey and the Beanstalk]]'', specifically the part where Mickey tries to convince the giant into turning into a fly."
* Pip's personality is very similar to that of Timon from ''[[The Lion King]]''.
* Bella Notte, the Italian restaurant where Giselle, Robert and Morgan eat, is a tribute to the song from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.&lt;ref name="kit" /&gt;
* Giselle pulls Edward's sword from the ballroom floor; this is a reference to ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;
* Narissa turns into a dragon, just like [[Maleficent]] in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref name="Hidden Disney in 'Enchanted'"/&gt; 
* When Edward flips through the channels on the TV, references are made to ''Robin Hood'', ''[[Dumbo]]'' (the fanfare from "Pink Elephants on Parade" is heard), and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (the soap opera has [[Paige O'Hara]], voice of [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]], playing a woman named Angela, a reference to [[Angela Lansbury]], voice of Mrs. Potts, arguing with a man named Jerry, a reference to [[Jerry Orbach]], voice of Lumiere).&lt;ref name="Hidden Disney in 'Enchanted'"/&gt; 
* While shopping, Giselle and Morgan pass a shop called [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]], a possible reference to the character of the same name from the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]].
* Robert and Morgan's last name is Philip, a reference to the prince from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.
* Giselle is initially upside down when she falls through the fountain and lands upright in the manhole, a reference to the scene in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' where [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] falls down the rabbit hole and lands upside down in [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]].
* Narissa's appearance in the soup pot when talking to Nathaniel is reference to the [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], ''[[Return to Halloweentown]]'', when [[Debbie Reynolds]]' character, [[List of Halloweentown series characters#Aggie Cromwell the 3rd|Agetha Cromwell]], is talking to her daughter, [[List of Halloweentown series characters#Gwen Piper|Gwen Piper]], in the same type of soup pot at the beginning of the ''Halloweentown'' film.
* While singing "That's How You Know," Giselle runs up a knoll in a similar fashion to Belle as she sings [[Belle (Disney song)|her theme]] in ''Beauty and the Beast''. It is also visually similar to an iconic scene in ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', performed by Julie Andrews.
* Morgan owns a doll of Belle from ''Beauty and the Beast'' and a ''Cinderella'' storybook.
* While Giselle constructs her Dream Man, a rose with a glass cover just like the one featured in ''Beauty and the Beast'' can be seen.
* Though not yet a princess upon the release of this film, actress [[Idina Menzel]], who portrays Nancy Tremaine, would later voice Elsa, the titular character of the 3D Disney Princess computer-animated musical feature ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.

[[File:Luncheon in the Studio - Manet.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Édouard Manet]], ''Luncheon in the Studio'' (1868). Oil on canvas; 118 × 154 cm. [[Neue Pinakothek]], Munich]]

'''''Luncheon in the Studio''''' (or '''''The Luncheon''''') is an 1868 oil painting by [[Édouard Manet]]. Partially a portrait of 16-year-old  Léon Leenhoff — the son of [[Suzanne Manet|Suzanne Leenhoff]] before her 1863 marriage to Manet, and possibly the son of Manet or Manet's father Auguste — it is also an enigmatic work that has received limited attention within Manet's oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 107; Stalnaker, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Nan Stalnaker notes that "despite continued questions about its meaning, the work is acknowledged to be brilliantly painted and a major Manet work".

== Description ==

In the summer of 1868 Manet traveled to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] for his summer vacation, where he painted  ''Luncheon in the Studio'' and other works. ''Luncheon'' was posed in the dining room of Manet's rented house.

Leenhoff is the focus of the painting, with his back to the other two people, who have at various points been identified as his mother and Manet. These identifications are now seen as incorrect;  the man seated at the table, smoking a cigar and enjoying a coffee and a ''digestif'', is anonymous—although he bears a resemblance to Manet (his friend, the painter Auguste Rousselin has also been suggested). The woman gazing toward the viewer is a servant. Given the uncertain status of Leenhoff's paternity, Meyers proposes that the two figures may nevertheless represent Suzanne and Édouard symbolically, specifically "their belated recognition and acceptance of Auguste [Manet]'s son".&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In an otherwise muted color scheme, the yellow in Leenhoff's tie, pants, and straw hat connect with the lemon on the table. The armour that appears incongruently in the bottom-left corner recalls its symbolism and collectibility before and during the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], when it was also the subject of [[still life]]s. The table holds more conventional subjects of the genre, including a peeled lemon, oysters, a [[Delft]] sugar bowl, and a knife that protrudes off the table.&lt;ref name="Brombert"/&gt; In this way Manet represents both the "romantic" and "naturalistic" modes of his art, according to Collins, who also notes, given the presence of the man in the background, that smoking was popular among "young romantics".&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early reception ==

[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Manet's ''[[The Balcony (painting)|The Balcony]]'' and ''Luncheon in the Studio'' were exhibited in the same year. Both were criticized. Leenhoff also appears in this painting, in the dark background.]]

The painting was exhibited in the 1869 [[Paris Salon]] along with Manet's ''[[The Balcony (painting)|The Balcony]]'', another work that lacked a simple [[hierarchy of genres|genre affiliation]], and in which at least one of the figures seems to confront the viewer as if challenging the "[[fourth wall]]".&lt;ref name="f298"&gt;Fried, 298–99&lt;/ref&gt; Both pieces were found wanting by art critics of the day; by this time a common criticism of Manet was that his goal was to "attract attention at any price".&lt;ref name="f298"/&gt; The reviewer [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] criticized the two paintings in a quote that well reflects the conventional expectations of a painting in this period, just before the further turbulence that [[Impressionism]] brought upon art:

&lt;blockquote&gt; What's the source of [Manet's] sterility? It's that while basing his art on nature, he neglects to make its aim the interpretation of life. He borrows his subjects from poets or takes them from his imagination; he isn't concerned to discover them in living usages. Whence, in his positions, much of their arbitrariness. In the ''Luncheon'', for example, I see on a table where coffee is served a half-peeled lemon and fresh oysters, but these objects don't go together. Why have they been put there then? I know very well why. Because Manet has to the highest extent a feeling for colored patches, because he excels in representing that which is inanimate, and feeling superior in his still lifes, he is naturally inclined to paint them whenever possible... And just as Manet brings together, solely for the pleasure of striking the eyes, still-life elements that belong apart, he also distributes his personages haphazardly, without anything necessary and forced in their composition. Whence the uncertainty and often the obscurity of his thought. What is the young man doing in the ''Luncheon'', seated in the foreground and seeming to look out at the public? True, he is well painted, brushed by a vigorous hand; but where is he? In the dining room? In that case, having his back to the table, he has the wall between him and us, and his position no longer makes any sense... [A] feeling for functions, for appropriateness, is indispensable... Like the personages in a play, it's necessary that every figure in a painting is in its proper plane, fulfills its role, and thereby contributes to the expression of the general idea. Nothing arbitrary and nothing superfluous, that is the law of all artistic composition.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fried, 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another critic, Marius Chaumelin, echoed this sentiment (speaking of both paintings): "The personages... are not at all handsome [except for the seated woman in ''The Balcony'', Berthe Morisot], their faces having something morose and disagreeable about them, like the faces of persons who pose, and in fact all these figures have the air of saying to us: Look at me!... Thus, no expression, no feeling, no composition." He spoke of "types without character, scenes devoid of all interest" and said disparagingly (yet insightfully from the point of view of modern criticism) that "Manet had made the portrait of a ''Balcony'' and a ''Luncheon''".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fried, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible influences ==
[[File:Edgar Degas - Achille De Gas in the Uniform of a Cadet.jpg|thumb|Edgar Degas, ''Achille De Gas in the Uniform of a Cadet'' (1855)]]

Meyers finds the depiction of Leenhoff similar in some respects to an 1855 portrait by [[Edgar Degas]] of his brother, ''Achille De Gas in the Uniform of a Cadet''. They share the leaning pose, the presence of swords, and facial characteristics. He further suggests that, by borrowing from the Degas work, Manet is hinting that Leenhoff is also his brother (not, as was assumed by all, his son).&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Fried sees the influence of the genre scenes of [[Vermeer]], who had recently been "rediscovered" and popularized in France by [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]]. As in Vermeer, the scene captures "arrested action" and involves a servant.&lt;ref name="Brombert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brombert|first=Beth Archer|year=1994|title=The Man with the Sword: Edouard Manet's Double-Edged Works|journal=Nineteenth-Century French Studies|volume=22|issue=3/4|pages=487–504|jstor=23537147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of still life on the table "allude unmistakably" to [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]'s still life ''[[:commons:File:Jean Siméon Chardin - The Ray - WGA04738.jpg|La Raie depouillee]]'' (1728); note the oysters and the knife handle jutting off the table, which with the lemon and Delft sugar bowl also recall Dutch still life.&lt;ref name="Brombert"/&gt;  Fried mentions that Manet's painting has "possible" allusions to two French paintings from before the turn of the century: [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Andromache Mourning Hector]]'' (1783; note the armour in the bottom-left corner) and [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]'s ''[[:commons:File:The Return of Marcus Sextus 1799 Pierre-Narcisse Guérin.jpg|The Return of Marcus Sextus]]'' (1799).&lt;ref&gt;Fried, 105&lt;/ref&gt; The black cat on the chair is very likely a reference to [[Baudelaire]], who had died the previous year and was highly identified with cats—calling himself "the poet of cats" in 1853. Collins explains, "Both Baudelaire and Manet were part of a circle of men devoted to the cat as embodiment of their own thoughtful, feminine, and spiritual essence."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; A black cat also appears in Manet's famous ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863).

The painting is discussed in [[Ross King (author)|Ross King]]'s ''The Judgment of Paris'', where King notes: "In the bottom left of the painting is a medieval helmet and a pair of swords. In many respects it was, like ''[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]'', and ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', a defiant reworking of artistic tradition... the signatures of masculine bravery became cast-off props in a provincial dining-room, sharing the same dignity and distinction—no more, no less—as the potted plants, corked bottles and coffee urn."&lt;ref&gt;King, Ross (2006).

'''''Mother______! Mother______!''''' is a 1980 album by [[Clark Terry]] featuring [[Zoot Sims]], of a jazz symphony composed by Charles Schwartz. Terry and Sims are accompanied on the album by an octet, the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble and the soprano Joan Heller.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mother-!-mother-!-mw0000267776|label=Mother______!

==Reception==
{{Album ratings
|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]
|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;
}}
Ken Dryden reviewed the album for [[Allmusic]] and wrote that "Although Terry is in great form, the music will be rather challenging for most fans of Terry's jazz recordings to enjoy, and Heller's vocals prove to be more of a distraction than a complementary factor. The front cover is unusually bland for Pablo, filled with the composer's liner notes instead of photos from the studio session. ...this record is worth picking up if found at a reasonable price by serious fans of Clark Terry, but the typical jazz listener can safely bypass this release."&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;

'''Organizational space''' describes the influence of the spatial environment on the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of humans in and around [[organizations]]. It is an area of scientific research in which [[interdisciplinarity]] is a central perspective. It draws from [[management]], [[organization]] and [[architecture]] (Dale and [[Gibson Burrell|Burrell]], 2008) added with knowledge from, for instance, [[environmental psychology]] (Evans and Mitchell, 1998), [[social medicine]] (Macintyre et al., 2002), or [[spatial science]] (Festinger et al., 1950). In essence, it may be regarded as a special field of expertise of [[organization studies]] and [[change management (people)|change management]] applied to architecture. The knowledge area is related to [[evidence-based design]] in which the influence of the spatial environment on patient's [[health]], [[healing]], and [[customer satisfaction]] are being researched in [[health care]]. It is also related to practice-based areas of management such as [[facility management]] which is primarily devoted to the maintenance and care of commercial or institutional buildings and to [[property management]] in which the operation of [[real estate]] is central. Sometimes it is also referred to as [[organizational architecture]]. The scientific field of organizational space must be distinguished from [[social architecture]] in which the development of [[information and communication technologies]] is central and also different from [[space science]] which is concerned with the study of the [[universe]].

== Spatial, physical and built environment ==
This research strand distinguishes three different [[Environment (systems)|environments]]: the spatial environment from the [[physical environment]] and the [[built environment]]. 
* Spatial environment: the total context in which [[human]]s in and around [[organization]]s function.
* Physical environment: all [[Tangible property|tangible]] physical [[Entity|entities]] in and around organizations.
* Built environment: that what is commonly understood as [[architecture]] and that what is permanently fixed to it.

== Organizational-spatial cycle of change ==
The coherence between the organization and its spatial environment may be regarded as an interwoven [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] cyclical [[flux]] from contingencies, intermediates, performances to interventions (Mobach, 2009). The [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] are the [[organizations|organizational]], [[architecture|architectural]], [[Technology|technological]], and [[Natural environment|natural]] conditions under which organization function. In the end they influence the performance of an organization, but first they mix in the [[Mediation (statistics)|intermediates]]. In this way humans in and around organizations will, for instance, notice these contingencies and will give them meaning (Clegg and Kornberger, 2006; Van Marrewijk and Yanow, 2010). Moreover, the contingencies will also influence [[social network|social contact]] (Becker, 1981; Steele, 1973) and the degree to which a spatial environment can be functional (Sharles, 1923). Subsequently, the intermediates influence different [[Performance management|performances]], for instance, the [[health]], the [[mind]], and the [[behavior]] of people in and around [[organizations]]. The spatial environment can cause [[illness]], such as with the [[sick building syndrome]] (EPA, 1991), but it can also positively influence the vitality of people or the recovery after an operation (Ulrich, 1984). The performances can provoke managerial intervention. In turn, these interventions will change the contingencies, and by doing so, change the elements, relations, and properties of the conditions under which people function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2079">A '''''répétiteur''''' (from [[French language|French]] [[verb]] ''répéter'' meaning "to repeat, to go over, to learn, to [[rehearsal|rehearse]]"&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;) is an accompanist, tutor or coach of ballet dancers or opera dancers.

== Opera ==
In [[opera]], a ''répétiteur'' is the person responsible for coaching singers and playing the [[piano]] for music and production rehearsals.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50203075?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=repetiteur&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary], Oxford University Press, accessed 27 July 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coaching solo singers or choir members, the ''répétiteur'' will take on a number of the roles of a [[vocal coach]]: advising singers on how to improve their pitch and pronunciation, and correcting note or phrasing errors.

''Répétiteurs'' are skilled musicians who have strong [[sight-reading]] and score reading skills. In addition to being able to sight read piano parts, a ''répétiteur'' can play on the piano an orchestral score reducing it in real-time ([[orchestral reduction]]), by reading from a large open score of all of the instruments and voice parts. ''Répétiteurs'' are also skilled in following the directions of a conductor, in terms of changing the tempo, pausing, or adding other nuances.

== Ballet ==
In [[ballet]], a ''répétiteur'' teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; Several late 20th-century choreographers, such as [[George Balanchine#External links|George Balanchine]], [[Jerome Robbins#External links|Jerome Robbins]] and [[Twyla Tharp]], have established trusts and appointed conservators—hand-picked dancers who have intimate knowledge of particular ballets—as ''répétiteurs'' of their works.

'''''Saints Jerome and Mary Magdalen''''' are two sculptures by the Italian artist [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]. They sit in the [[Siena_Cathedral#The_Chigi_Chapel|Chigi Chapel]] of Siena Cathedral. The statues were commissioned as part of the chapel by the then pope Alexander VII (Fabio Chigi).&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Baldinucci, "Vita del cavaliere Gio: Lorenzo Bernini", 1682 [https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=1hMFAAAAYAAJ&amp;num=11&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA39 p.39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began on the sculptures in 1661 and they were delivered from Rome to Siena in 1663. Bernini was paid 2,128 scudi for his work, although he probably received considerable assistance in their creation.&lt;ref name = "wittkower"&gt;Rudolf Wittkower, ''Bernini, the Sculptor of the Roman Baroque'', 1997 (4th ed.), p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the chapel, there are a further two sculptures by artists from Bernini's workshop - a [[Catherine of Siena|St Catherine of Siena]] by [[Ercole Ferrata]] and a [[St Bernard of Siena]] by [[Antonio Raggi]]. The chapel as a whole was designed by Bernini.&lt;ref name = "wittkower" /&gt;

Scholars have emphasised the mystical experience being undergone by the figures. Rudolf Wittkower documents the "intensification of the visionary quality" in the statues, both figures engaged not in the physical world around them, but absorbed in their own spiritual spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Wittkower, ''Bernini, the Sculptor of the Roman Baroque'', 1997 (4th ed.), p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Hibbard continues this line of argument, demonstrating how the figures break out of the niches which are supposed to contain them—further evidence of how Jerome and Mary Magdalen are not constrained by the earthly world but responding to something higher.&lt;ref name = "hibbard"&gt;Howard Hibbard, "Bernini", 1990 (2nd ed.), pps. 191-5&lt;/ref&gt;

A preparatory drawing for the Mary Magdalen exists at the Leizpig Museum of Fine Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/08501/Athena_Update_ProvidedCHO_Bildarchiv_Foto_Marburg_obj_00032767_Z_19_466.html|title=Die Magdalena in Siena, Folio recto|author=Bernini, Giovanni Lorenzo (Zeichner)|accessdate=2012-06-23 |publisher=Europeana}}&lt;/ref&gt; while there is preparatory sculpture of Jerome's head in the [http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collection/detail.dot?objectid=1937.77 Fogg Art Museum]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of Harvard University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11587">The '''Schoenflies''' (or '''Schönflies''') '''notation''', named after the [[Germans|German]] mathematician [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe [[point group]]s. This notation is used in [[spectroscopy]]. The other convention is the [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], also known as the international notation. A point group in the Schoenflies convention is completely adequate to describe the symmetry of a molecule; this is sufficient for spectroscopy. The Hermann–Mauguin notation is able to describe the [[space group]] of a crystal lattice, while the Schoenflies notation isn't. Thus the Hermann–Mauguin notation is used in [[crystallography]].

==Symmetry elements==
Symmetry elements are denoted by '''i''' for centers of inversion, '''C''' for proper rotation axes, '''σ''' for mirror planes, and '''S''' for improper rotation axes ([[rotation-reflection axes]]). '''C''' and '''S''' are usually followed by a subscript number (abstractly denoted '''n''') denoting the order of rotation possible.

By convention, the axis of proper rotation of greatest order is defined as the principal axis. All other symmetry elements are described in relation to it.  A vertical mirror plane (containing the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'''; a horizontal mirror plane (perpendicular to the principal axis) is denoted '''σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Point groups==
In three dimensions, there are an infinite number of point groups, but all of them can be classified by several families. 

*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[cyclic group|cyclic]]) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis. 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (''horizontal plane''). 
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the addition of ''n'' mirror planes containing the axis of rotation (''vertical planes''). 
*''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for ''Spiegel'', German for [[mirror]]) contains only a 2''n''-fold [[rotation-reflection axis]]. The index should be even because when ''n'' is odd an ''n''-fold rotation-reflection axis is equivalent to a combination of an ''n''-fold rotation axis and a perpendicular plane, hence ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' for odd ''n''.
*''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' has only a [[Improper rotation|rotoinversion axis]]. These symbols are redundant, because any rotoinversion axis can be expressed as rotation-reflection axis, hence for odd ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'', and for even ''n'' ''C&lt;sub&gt;2ni&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;''. Only ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is conventionally used, but in some texts you can see symbols like ''C&lt;sub&gt;3i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;5i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
*''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (for [[dihedral group|dihedral]], or two-sided) has an ''n''-fold rotation axis plus ''n'' twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. 
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nh&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition, a horizontal mirror plane and, as a consequence, also ''n'' vertical mirror planes each containing the ''n''-fold axis and one of the twofold axes.
:*''D&lt;sub&gt;nd&lt;/sub&gt;'' has, in addition to the elements of ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''n'' vertical mirror planes which pass between twofold axes (''diagonal planes'').
* ''T'' (the chiral [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of a tetrahedron (three 2-fold axes and four 3-fold axes). 
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes diagonal mirror planes (each diagonal plane contains only one twofold axis and passes between two other twofold axes, as in ''D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;''). This addition of diagonal planes results in three improper rotation operations '''S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.
:*''T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes three horizontal mirror planes. Each plane contains two twofold axes and is perpendicular to the third twofold axis, which results in inversion center '''i'''.
* ''O'' (the chiral [[octahedron|octahedral]] group) has the rotation axes of an octahedron or [[cube]] (three 4-fold axes, four 3-fold axes, and six diagonal 2-fold axes).
:*''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and, as a consequence, vertical mirror planes. It contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
* ''I'' (the chiral [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] group) indicates that the group has the rotation axes of an icosahedron or [[dodecahedron]] (six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and 15 2-fold axes).
:*''I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' includes horizontal mirror planes and contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
&lt;!-- I think, it shouldn't be here: 
It is important to note that the 'plane' in the definition of the rotation-reflection (alternating) axis of symmetry is '''not necessarily''' a mirror plane of the group in which the axis exists.  The ''S'' groups, for example, have no mirror planes. 
May be it should go to Improper rotation page? --&gt;
All groups that do not contain several higher-order axes (order 3 or more) can be arranged in a table, as shown below; symbols marked in red should not be used.

In crystallography, due to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], ''n'' is restricted to the values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The noncrystallographic groups are shown with grayed backgrounds. ''D''&lt;sub&gt;4''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;6''d''&lt;/sub&gt; are also forbidden because they contain [[improper rotation]]s with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus ''T'', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''O'' and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; constitute 32 [[crystallographic point groups]].  

Groups with ''n = ∞'' are called limit groups or [[Curie group]]s. There are two more limit groups, not listed in the table: ''K'' (for ''Kugel'', German for ball, sphere), the group of all rotations in 3-dimensional space; and ''K&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', the group of all rotations and reflections. In mathematics and theoretical physics they are known respectively as the ''[[special orthogonal group]]'' and the ''[[orthogonal group]]'' in three-dimensional space, with the symbols SO(3) and O(3).

== Space groups ==
The [[List of space groups#List|space groups]] with given point group are numbered  by 1, 2, 3, ...  (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the corresponding point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have Schönflies symbols ''C''{{sup sub|1|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|2|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|3|2}}. 

While in case of point groups, Schönflies symbol defines the symmetry elements of group unambiguously, the additional superscript for space group doesn't have any information about translational symmetry of space group (lattice centering, translational components of axes and planes), hence one needs to refer to special tables, containing information about correspondence between Schönflies and [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]. Such table is given in [[List of space groups]] page.

{{Literature}}

A '''short story collection''' is a book of [[short story|short stories]] and/or [[novella]]s by a single author, as distinguished from an [[anthology]] of fiction, which would contain work by several authors (e.g., ''[[Les Soirées de Médan]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/17/the-10-best-short-story-collections Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://electricliterature.com/electric-literatures-25-best-story-collections-of-2014/ Electric Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/the-best-short-story-collections-from-childish-gabbling-to-jaded-nihilism/ The Spectator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/books/a-good-fit-for-small-screens-short-stories-are-selling.html?_r=0 The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The stories in a collection may or may not share a [[theme (literature)|theme]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], or [[fictional character|characters]] with one another. Short story collections may also include works of [[poetry]] and notes by the author.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3583">'''The Society of Layerists in [[Multimedia|Multi-Media]]''' (SLMM) is a group of artists, centred in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], United States, and formed in 1982. It describes itself as a network for artists and other persons interested in a [[holistic]] perspective. The Society has members at, and affiliations with, [[Michigan Technological University|Michigan Tech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Tech arts faculty|url=http://www.fa.mtu.edu/~mabeckwi/resume.htm|accessdate=18 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606110841/http://www.fa.mtu.edu/~mabeckwi/resume.htm|archivedate=6 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layering==
The society was formed to look at the concept it refers to as "Layering" on a deeper level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holistic approach/Society of Layerists in Multi-Media shares philosophy, not medium|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5964781.html|publisher=Highbeam|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=1 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society describes layering, in the context it uses the word, as something other than a label for a particular [[Style in art|style]] or [[medium (art)|medium]]: it defines Layering as a way of making [[art]] in order to express ultimate connectedness, or a way to think about creating art as a synthesis of ideas from many sources. These include the sciences, [[philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], [[memory|memories]], [[synchronicities|synchronicities]], and the [[imagination]]. The society suggests that a sense something "other" than the visible inhabits a Layered work, and that a Layered work is not distinguished by the technique so much as by "the mind of the artist who makes it"; that the Layering is an [[Ephemerality|evanescent]], as well as a tangible, [[metaphor]] that "grows like moss from living and learning".

Mary Carroll Nelson, founder of SLMM, observes that "In layered art, many events connect at a single point in space; and many points in space are linked at a single moment in time." Alexander Nepote, SLMM’s late [[mentor]], expressed an idea that is relevant to Layering: "[[Energy]] that connects everything is a [[cosmic web]]— this includes information from the [[collective unconscious]], the metaphysical as well as the physical."

The purpose of SLMM is to offer creative artists a holistic way to relate to one another, as differentiated from the [[academia|academic]] structure of professional artists’ associations based on a single medium, such as [[watercolor]], [[pastel]], or [[sculpture]]. The network is meant to act as a leavening in a society whose values are based on a system of separation through competition, [[careerism]], and [[hierarchy]]. SLMM is a society of equals designed to encourage creative expression and dynamic growth.

The society reports that many members follow a personal path of [[aesthetics]] combined with an active interest in wholeness. All new members must join first as Associates. Spouses and significant others have also joined as Associates. Associate Membership is an honored state, and a number of artists remain as Associate Members by choice. Those applying for full membership must be Associate Members in good standing and then go through an application process.

[[Image:Table-book, Lawes.jpg|thumb|right|A table-book printing from [[Henry Lawes]]' ''The treasury of musick: containing ayres and dialogues to sing to the theorbo-lute or basse-viol.'', 1669.]]
A '''table-book''' is a [[manuscript]] or printed book which is arranged so that all the parts of a piece of music can be read from it while seated around a table. They were made in the 16th and 17th century for both instrumental and vocal pieces. They are an extension of the idea of Choir books, in which all parts are displayed on one page, in contrast with [[partbook]]s, which have a different book for each part (one book for all the soprano parts, another for all the altos, etc.) and each performer has their own book. 

The first example of such a book is probably ''Le parangon des chansons'' (1538) by [[Jacques Moderne]] of [[Lyon]]. There are far more English than Continental examples of this type of book. English sources contain many lute pieces and works by [[John Dowland]], including his ''[[Lachrimae]]''. 

The books began displaying duets, and later quartets. Later systems of displaying parts worked for up to six performers, and in extreme cases as many as 12. 
[[Image:Tablebook.jpg|thumb|right|A more involved example, showing four parts and multiple verses]]

The publisher [[Peter Short (printer)|Peter Short]] published 30 [[lute song]] books in the table-book format, many of them containing Dowland's music, beginning in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~mlo26/printers.html Drexel.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Classical architecture]] a '''term''' or '''terminal figure''' (plural: '''terms''' or '''termini''') is a human head and bust that continues as a square  tapering pillar-like form.

The name derives from [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the Roman god of boundaries and boundary markers. If the bust is of [[Hermes]] as protector of boundaries in ancient Greek culture, with male genitals interrupting the plain base at the appropriate height, it may be called a '''[[herma]]''' or '''herm'''.  The crime of [[Alcibiades]] and his drinking-mates, for which [[Socrates]] eventually indirectly paid with his life, was the desecration of herm figures through Athens in the dead of night.

At the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the Lady of Ephesus, whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, was a many-breasted goddess encased in a tapering term, from which her feet protruded. (See illustration at [[Temple of Artemis]]).

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European [[Renaissance]] and the succeeding [[Classicism|Classical styles]], term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[faun]]s and [[Bacchante]]s especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called [[Antwerp Mannerism]]. Engravings disseminated the style through Germany and England.

Term figures as table supports or employed as candlestands (French ''guéridon'') were characteristic of the Late Baroque Louis XIV style in France, the Low Countries and England, revived in the neo-Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] and employed again in the French Empire style of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetantiquegazette.com/furniture/1726_gueridon_definition/|title=Gueridon – definition|publisher=Internet Antique Gazette|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Guitar Player''''' is a circa 1672&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; painting by [[Jan Vermeer]], on display in [[Kenwood House]], [[London]] as part of the [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh#Art collector|Iveagh Bequest]].  In 2012 Kenwood closed for renovations until autumn 2013, and the painting was on display in the [[National Gallery]] for this period, next to their own two Vermeers.&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-the-guitar-player |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426073213/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-the-guitar-player |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to Kenwood House in late December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/vermeer-guitar-player-art-kenwood-house |title=What Vermeer's guitar player taught me about the joy of art &amp;#124; Simon Jenkins &amp;#124; Opinion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On February 23, 1974, the painting was stolen from Kenwood House and held for a ransom of over $1 million (US) in food to be distributed on the Caribbean island of [[Grenada]], or else the painting would be destroyed by those who had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717151931/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oKdbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=809,5122199&amp;dq=grenada+vermeer&amp;hl=en ]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a small strip of the painting was sent to ''The Times'' of London along with a demand that the Irish Republican sisters [[Marian Price|Marian]] and [[Dolours Price]] be allowed to serve their prison sentences near their homes in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_02.html#.WTIEXBIrLHc |title=Vermeer Thefts: The Guitar Player |website=Essentialvermeer.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recovered by [[Scotland Yard]] in the cemetery of [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]], in London's financial district, on May 7, 1974. Although the painting showed signs of dampness, it was otherwise undamaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728163846/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VW5kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vn0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1138,3283197&amp;dq=vermeer&amp;hl=en] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Patterson began writing ''The Quants'' in 2008. He was first exposed to the [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] [[investment strategies]] while covering the [[financial industry]] for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Greg|title=The Quants: Q&amp;A With Scott Patterson|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/quants-scott-patterson-fat-tails-todd/4/13/2010/id/27748|publisher=Minyanville|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he became more acquainted with the players involved, he found that many of the most successful quants knew each other and carried similar eccentricities.&lt;ref name=min/&gt; Realizing this was a world that the average investor knew little of, Patterson wrote the book to shed light on the strategies, players, and related risks of such trading strategies.&lt;ref name=min/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The introduction to ''The Quants'' describes the real-life, annual, high-stakes [[poker]] match between Wall Street's hedge fund managers, comparing their trading styles to their poker strategies.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Scott|title=How Math Whizzes Helped Sink the Economy]|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=quants-book|publisher=Scientific American|date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on, among other things, the 2007 [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and how it helped trigger a sudden and massive unwind of complex, highly leveraged quantitative strategies. The book also delves into critical short-comings of many quantitative strategies, such as their tendency to lead to crowded trades and their underestimation of the likelihood of chaotic, volatile moves in the markets.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|last=Sender|first=Henny|title=Wall St maths geniuses whose models did not add up|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d0fbfad4-16ad-11df-aa09-00144feab49a.html#axzz223gU2rnb|publisher=Financial Times|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also delves into the background of the various vanguards of quantitative analysis. It tells the history  of ''Beat the Market'' &amp; ''Beat the Dealer'' author [[Edward O.

[[Image:Pavel Filonov Faces.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pavel Filonov]], ''Faces on an [[Icon]] (Countenances)'', 1940, oil on paper, 64x56 cm, [[Russian Museum]].]] 

'''Universal Flowering''' (''Mirovoi rastsvet'') is the name given by [[Pavel Filonov]] to his system of analytical art.  The system arose from [[Cubo-futurism|cubo-futurist]] experiments and works that he undertook from 1913-1915.  It is characterized by very dense, minutely facetted, and relatively flat surfaces created by working from the particular to the general, using the smallest of brushes and the sharpest of pencils.  The images have both [[Cubism]]'s multiple vantage points and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]'s representation of a figure over time. A number of the paintings, while having a given orientation, are painted as though they could be oriented in a variety of ways.  Filonov's philosophy was originally formalized in written form in 1915, which was revised and published as ''The Declaration of Universal Flowering'' in 1923 when Filonov was a professor at the (then) [[Petrograd]] [[St.Petersburg Academy of arts|Academy of Arts]].  Filonov's main theoretical work ''The Ideology of Analytical Art'' (''Ideologia analiticheskogo iskusstva'') was published in 1930.

'''''Women in Music''''' was an [[United States|American]] newsletter founded in July 1935 by its publisher and editor, [[Frédérique Petrides]], then the conductor of the [[Orchestrette Classique]] &amp;ndash; an orchestra based in New York made-up of all women musicians. The publication ran until December 1940. The thirty-seven [[Extant literature|extant issues]] were reprinted in the 1991 book by Jan Bell Groh, ''Evening the Score: Women in Music and the Legacy of Frédérique Petrides''. The newsletter title ''Women in Music'' was coined in 1935 by Petrides's husband, journalist, [[West Side Orchestral Concerts#Publicist and manager, Peter Petrides|Peter Petrides]] to encapsulate the gist of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;Groh (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Frédérique Petrides Papers''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
''Women in Music'' was founded in the summer of 1935 for the purpose of enlightening the public with little-known historical facts and current developments pertaining to women conductors, composers, instrumentalists, singers and women-led orchestras. Its scope was not limited to contemporary musicians &amp;ndash; it chronicled the activities of women musicians from [[Ancient Egypt]]ian times to the then present.

The publication was sent free-of-charge to newspaper and magazine editors, libraries, music schools, institutions, and individuals in New York and elsewhere. The publication had a circulation of over 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;LePage (1983), pp.&amp;nbsp;203&amp;ndash;204&lt;/ref&gt;

Major print media, including music journals, general magazines, and newspapers have cited ''Women in Music'' as a prime source for opinions, facts, and quotes. Some of the newspapers include ''[[The New York Times]]; [[The New York Sun]]; [[New York World-Telegram]]; [[New York Daily News]]; [[New York Post]]; [[The Baltimore Sun]]; [[Chicago Tribune]]; [[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union]]; [[Los Angeles Times]]; [[Press-Telegram]]; [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and publications that drew articles from ''[[Everybody's Weekly]]'' syndication.&lt;ref&gt;Groh (1991), p.&amp;nbsp;121&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The ''Women in Music'' newsletters are the primary source for research done by musicologists on women in music." &amp;mdash; Adrienne Fried Block, PhD (1921–2009), musicologist and choral director&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/author/fried-block Musicologist and choral director Adrienne Block, PhD], ''{{linktext|née}}'' Fried (1921–2009) (1992); Petrides family letters and papers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
