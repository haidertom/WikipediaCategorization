The '''album-equivalent unit''' is a measurement unit in [[music industry]] to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one [[album]] copy.&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"/&gt; This consumption includes [[streaming media|streaming]] and [[music download|song downloads]] in addition to traditional [[album sales]]. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-[[2010s]] as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the only albums that [[Music_recording_certification|went platinum]] in the United States in 2014 were the ''[[Frozen (soundtrack)|Frozen]]'' soundtrack and [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the "best-selling albums" ranking into the "most popular albums" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7393605/drakes-views-no-1-fifth-week-billboard-200|title=Drake's 'Views' Rules at No. 1 for Fifth Week on Billboard 200 Chart|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=Billboard|date=May 22, 2016|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/global-artist-chart.php|title=Global Recording Artist of the Year|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses on record charts==
=== United States ===
Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called [[Top Album Sales]], that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data.&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Trust|title=Billboard 200 Makeover: Album Chart to Incorporate Streams &amp; Track Sales|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2014-11-20|accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Swift's ''1989'' was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales).&lt;ref name="pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6334866/taylor-swift-1989-returns-no-1-billboard-200 |title=Taylor Swift's '1989' Returns to No. 1 on Revamped Billboard 200|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/589-why-is-taylor-swift-still-1-interpreting-the-revamped-billboard-200-album-chart/ |title=Why Is Taylor Swift Still #1?|work=pitchfork.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 8, 2015 issue, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 53 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 53]]'' became the first album in history to miss the top position of the ''Billboard'' 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/28306/20150212/now-53-outsells-taylor-swift-becomes-first-record-top-albums-kid-ink.htm|title=Now 53 Outsells Taylor Swift, Becomes First Record to Top Albums Chart but Not Billboard 200; Kid Ink Cracks Top 10|first=Ryan|last=Book|date=February 12, 2015|work=The Music Times|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/arts/music/drake-scorpion-streams-billboard-chart.html|title=The Music Industry’s Math Changes, but the Outcome Doesn’t: Drake Is No. 1|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=July 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Official Charts Company]] has included streaming into the [[UK Albums Chart]] since March 2015.&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487512/sam-smiths-in-the-lonely-hour-tops-historic-uk-albums-chart |title=Sam Smith's 'In the Lonely Hour' Tops Historic U.K. Albums Chart|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful [[single (music)|singles]]. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-s-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__8012/ |title=Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for first time|work=officialcharts.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]'' was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales.&lt;ref name="Sam"/&gt; By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/drakes-official-top-40-most-streamed-songs__21625/|title=Drake's Official Top 40 most streamed songs|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, [[German Albums Chart]] is used to ranking the albums based on weekly [[revenue]], instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160201142531/http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 1, 2016|publisher=Musikmarkt.de|language=German|title=Deutsche Album-Charts integrieren Premium-Streaming|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deutsche-Album-Charts-jetzt-auch-mit-Streaming-Zahlen-3089360.html|title=Deutsche Album-Charts jetzt auch mit Streaming-Zahlen|first=Volker|last=Briegleb|date=February 1, 2016|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes.com]], Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/08/17/how-longer-albums-and-streaming-giants-are-manipulating-the-charts/2/#69d2965051b3|title=How Longer Albums And Streaming Giants Are Manipulating The Charts|publisher=Forbes|date=2017-08-17|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Josephs from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said: "If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album "sales"—as listeners check the album out." He also criticized [[Chris Brown]]'s album ''[[Heartbreak on a Full Moon]]'' which contains over 40 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/|title=Why Does Chris Brown’s New Album Have 40 Songs?|date=2017-05-02|publisher=Spin|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1957, the American Society of African Culture (AMSAC) was officially founded by five African American intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;The founders were political scientist and civil rights activist John A. Davis, historian and social scientist Horace Mann Bond (1904-1972), professor of French and future American ambassador Will Mercer Cook (1903-1987), philosopher William T. Fontaine (1909-1968) and James Ivy, editor of the NAACP's ''Crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt; During its heyday in the early 1960s, AMSAC had around four hundred members. One of the main goals of the organisation was to expose African Americans to their African heritage. This aim was pursued through organising exhibitions, lectures, music performances, and conferences in the United States (primarily New York) and Africa (occasionally). AMSAC sponsored a two-day [[festival]] in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] in December 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=African-American Cultural Exchange|journal=Ebony|date=March 1962|volume=17|issue=5|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1967, AMSAC's membership sharply declined after it was named as one of the organisations that was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Cooke, ‘More Organisations Find They Are On CIA's Fund List, ''The Guardian'', 18 February 1967, p. 9; Neil Sheehan, ‘5 New Groups Tied To C.I.A.

'''Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art''' (ACCEA) is a contemporary art institution  active in [[Yerevan]], capital of [[Armenia]]. The Armenian acronym of ACCEA is “NPAK”. In [[Armenia]]n the name is: Նորարար Փորձառական Արվեստի Կենտրոն «ՆՓԱԿ».

==Introduction==
ACCEA/NPAK was founded in 1992 by [[Sonia Balassanian]] (a New York-based artist and poet of Armenian descent) just after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and creation of Newly Independent State (NIS) of Republic of [[Armenia]].

The organization was co-founded by [[Edward Balassanian]], Ph.D., an architect and urban planner, also of Armenian descent.

The date of formal incorporation of ACCEA/NPAK as a non-profit foundation in [[Armenia]] was 1994.  The organization is also registered as a non-profit 501(c)3 organization in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States|U.S.]].

==Subject==

*ACCEA/NPAK motto is “Quest for new frontiers”. 
*Its mission is introduction of international contemporary art in [[Armenia]], discovering and encouragement of Armenian contemporary art and promotion of its presence on the international art scene. 
*ACCEA/NPAK is the only center for contemporary experimental art in the Southern Caucasus, showing “cutting-edge” art of painting, sculpture, installation, video and performing arts.

==Notability==
*Virtually all of the contemporary artist and curators of [[Armenia]] have been either discovered or developed in the Center, and have been introduced and promoted on the international arena.
*ACCEA/NPAK organized historically first official participation of Armenia at [[Venice Biennale]] of Art in 1995. The effort was continued without interruption until 2009 (8 consecutive times), after which the [[Ministry of Culture of Armenia]] took over the effort.

==Official Pavilion of the Republic of Armenia  at Venice Biennale==
In 1995, by the initiative and direction of the Balassanian couple, historically for the first time, Republic of Armenia was represented at the international fine arts exhibition of Venice Biennale. They continued organizing the Armenian Pavilions at Venice Biennale without interruption until 2009 (8 consecutive times).  Armenian Pavilions at Venice Biennale have been realized exclusively by donations collected from the Armenian Diaspora.

*Active departments of the Center in 2011 are Department of Fine Arts (Painting, sculpture, installation video arts, etc.), Department of Theater, Cinema and Video, and Department of Architecture. 
*In the past, from time-to-time active departments of the Center have been departments of music (experimental and rock) and literature. 
*Since April 1996 ACCEA/NPAK has been operating at a 1,823 m2 (19,450 square foot) space provided by the Government of [[Armenia]]. The venue is located at the heart of [[Yerevan]] in walking distance from the Republic Square, where the Prime Minister’s office, several ministries and the National Museum of History and National Gallery of Paintings are located.

==Activities  of ACCEA/NPAK==
Main objectives of ACCEA/NPAK have been, and continue to be, encouraging and assisting free and uninhibited expression, and opening “new horizons” in arts and artistic expression of Armenian artists, as well as discovery of new and young artistic talents and providing them opportunity of presenting their work. This is the main objective of annual festival of alternative art organized by ACCEA/NPAK. At the center active parts are played by “The Project Room”, where artists present new and experimental projects, and the “Open Studio”, which has been initiated in 2011. Here individual artist creates a single work during a limited period, showing the creative process as well as the end result at the end of the period.&lt;br/&gt;
As an indicator of successes of the center suffice it to state that while in 1992-1994 period it started with one group exhibition per year, during 2001 through 2010 period the number of individual and group exhibitions have fluctuated between 10 and 20 per year.&lt;br/&gt; 
During the last decade parallel with exhibitions the center has organized two international festivals of experimental theater and video (short and feature films) per year.&lt;br/&gt; 
In appreciation of cultural services provided to the Armenian contemporary art in early 2002, Government of Republic of Armenia issued a decree by which the space occupied by ACCEA/NPAK was provided to it for indefinite period free of charge.&lt;br/&gt; 
In 2003 by sponsorship of late writer and architect Rouben H. Avanessian (Pen-name: R. Ben) ACCEA/NPAK initiated erection of quadruple-scale bronze cast of forefather of Armenian Contemporary art Yervand Kotchar’s “Melancholy” sculpture in Yerevan, in front of the entrance of the center. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in social  and cultural life of the Capital of Armenia.

==Educational Activities==
On the informal level of education ACCEA/NPAK as a rule always publishes booklets and sometimes extensive catalogues for exhibitions, which contain texts by curators describing the conceptual basis and arguments leading to organization of events and exhibitions. Sometimes the publications include artist’s statement. The body of these publications form an informal public education initiative for introducing and promoting contemporary concepts of art.

ACCEA/NPAK is in the process of initiating [[Independent Study Program]] (ISP) based on the model of [[New York’s Whitney Museum]] ISP, where newly graduated artists get opportunity to meet experienced masters in the arts and culture and enrich their insight and global appreciation of art.

[[File:Tom Thomson at Lake Scugog.jpg|thumb|Tom Thomson photographed by T. H. Marten on [[Lake Scugog]], 1910.]]

'''Tom Thomson''' (1877–1917) was a Canadian painter from the beginning of the 20th century. Beginning from humble roots, his development as a career painter was meteoric, only pursuing it seriously in the final years of his life. He became one of the foremost figures in [[Canadian art]], leaving behind around 400 small oil sketches and around fifty larger works on canvas.

Beginning his career in 1902 as a graphic designer, he only began to paint seriously in 1912 at the age of 35. His skills developed as he ventured through [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], sketching scenes that interested him. His creative peak came from 1914 until his [[Death and legacy of Tom Thomson|untimely death in 1917]]. His art style progressed from sombre, grey scenes into brilliantly coloured exposés, characterized by rapid and thickly applied brushstrokes. His later works presage the advances seen by the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement.

The artwork of Thomson is typically divided into two bodies: the first is made up of the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around fifty larger works on canvas.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The smaller sketches were typically done in the style of [[en plein air]] in "the North," primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 59–60]}} The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in [[Rosedale, Toronto]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}}{{sfnb|Brown|1998|pp=151, 158}} Although he sold few of the larger paintings during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at [[Wembley]] in London, that eventually brought international attention to his work,{{sfnb|Dejardin|2011}} though the more plentiful sketches have typically been thought of as the core of his work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 60]}}

He considered most of his sketches to be complete works in themselves and not studies for larger works, since in the transition to a larger canvas the works lose their characteristic intimacy.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#canvases-versus-oil-sketches 60]}} Still, a dozen or so of the major canvases were directly derived from smaller sketches. Indeed, paintings like ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'', ''[[Spring Ice]]'', ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' were only later expanded into larger oil paintings.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} While the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Because of this, they display an "inherent formality," with the transition from small to large requiring a reinvention or elaboration of the original details.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–82}} In this transition he often exaggerated hillsides or other landscape features to give the final picture greater depth.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=110}} Comparing sketches with their respective canvases allows one to see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=182}}{{sfnb|Murray|2006|p=92}}

===Materials===
In 1914 Thomson made himself a sketch box to hold 8½ × 10½ inch (21.6 × 26.7&amp;nbsp;cm) panels.{{sfnb|Davies|c. 1930}} The lower half of the box served as a palette, while the upper half served as a support for canvas or wood panels. Slots made room for three paintings to be carried at any given time, keeping them apart so wet paint did not smear or flatten.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} Thomson utilized different materials throughout his career, providing a method for dating paintings.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} For example, the wood panels he used in 1914 developed vertical cracks.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}}{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} He had only occasionally used hard wood-pulp board in 1914, but consistently began using it in 1915.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} In the spring and fall of 1915 he used [[Terra cotta (color)|terra cotta-coloured]] and [[Carnation (painting)|carnation]]-coloured paint as [[Paint sealant|sealers]], but by 1916 he had switched to [[ochre]] paint.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}} In the spring of 1917 he disassembled and cut up wood [[crate]]s to make into 5 × 7 inch (12.7 × 17.8&amp;nbsp;cm) panels for sketching,{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=25}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1917a}} smaller than those he normally painted on and requiring tighter handling.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|pp=141–42}} Fragments of brand names (e.g. Gold Medal Purity Flour, California Oranges) are stamped on the back of some,{{sfnb|Murray|1994|p=7}} such as ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Birches Spring 1917.jpg|Birches]]'' and ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Ice Covered Lake.jpg|An Ice Covered Lake]]''.{{sfnb|Murray|1998|p=85}} During the same spring he reused around one-third of his sketches, either because he was not satisfied with them or because he was short on painting materials.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=116}}

In 2000, a study was conducted to understand the materials and working method of Thomson.{{sfnb|Corbeil|Moffatt|Sirois|Legate|2000}} In 2002–03, before a travelling exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario, the [[Canadian Conservation Institute]] utilized [[Infrared photography|infrared]] and X-ray photography, [[spectroscopy]] and micro-sampling of pigments to further analyze many of Thomson's paintings.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=145}} Sandra Webster-Cook and Anne Ruggles described in their research how Thomson applied differently coloured [[Primer (paint)|primers]] in various parts of his paintings to give them subtle yet important qualities.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|pp=145–46}}

===Photography===

Probably a view of the mill-yard of the abandoned Gilmour Lumber Company at [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]. The man seated on the stump is thought to be Tom Wattie, an [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] ranger.]]

Thomson occasionally used photography to capture things that gained his interest, such as fish he caught, images of his friends or the landscape. He does not seem to have used any of his photographs for producing art, with none of the extant photos corresponding to any of his paintings.{{sfnb|Reid|1971}} He instead preferred to capture images with small oil sketches, and nearly all of the works he produced are among these small sketches.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=215}} David Silcox however has speculated that ''[[Drowned Land]]'' (and perhaps other paintings) may have been painted with a photograph as a memory aid given their "uncanny precision."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#photography 63]}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's photographs, refer to {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Addison|Harwood|1969}}|{{harvp|Reid|1971}}|{{harvp|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues#photography 62–63]}}|{{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=214–15}}}}}}

In 1912 while travelling up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] in the [[Mississagi Provincial Park|Mississagi]] area with William Broadhead, Thomson lost at least a dozen rolls of film (claiming in a letter that he lost 14 dozen) along with many more sketches after their canoe experienced several spills.{{sfnb|Thomson|1912}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002a|p=297}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#gathering-momentum 15]}} He had intended to bring the images back to Grip Limited and use them in his commercial work.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=215}}

[[Tom Thomson]]'s first foray into art came in 1901 with his education at Canada Business College in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]]. It was there that he developed rudimentary penmanship abilities.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}} By 1902, he had been hired in [[Seattle]] at the design firm Maring &amp; Ladd, working as a pen artist, [[Drafter|draftsman]] and [[Etching|etcher]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} His main work there consisted in producing business cards, brochures and posters, as well as [[CMYK color model|three-colour printing]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Having previously learned [[calligraphy]], he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#early-adult-years 7]}} Thomson may have also worked as a freelance commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work to confirm these suspicions.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=51}} He was greatly influenced by the black and white illustrations he saw in magazines,{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|pp=47–63}} something especially apparent in his {{circa|lk=no|1903}} sketch, ''Study of a Woman's Head'', which draws inspiration from the "[[Gibson Girl]]" of American illustrator [[Charles Dana Gibson]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68]}} Thomson's younger brother Ralph wrote about Thomson during this period:

{{quote|[I had] a wonderful opportunity to observe his progress as a commercial artist and designer. He very often worked all night long while I watched him try one idea after another. The ones that did not meet with his approval he would either throw in the waste basket, burn up or smear with cigar ashes or the ends of burned matches. Others he would keep for a day or two but they would invariably meet the same fate. At that time he worked in pen and ink, water color and black and white wash. He was continually looking over the various magazines and giving the advertisements a great deal of study, principally from the standpoint of decoration. It was a regular game with him to pick the best of them, change the entire design to suit his own ideas, and then compare their respective merits.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=51}}{{sfnb|Thomson|1946}}}}

After returning to Toronto, Thomson joined the artistic design firm [[Grip Ltd.]] in either 1908 or 1909.{{efn|group=note|Sources disagree on the approximate time of Thomson being hired. Grip supervisor Albert H. Robson wrote in 1932 that he was hired in 1907,{{sfnb|Robson|1932|p=138}} but by 1937 Robson was instead writing that he was hired in 1908.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=5}} Robert Stacey has suggested December 1908.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}} David Silcox has suggested the beginning of 1909.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} Art historian [[Joan Murray (art historian)|Joan Murray]] has suggested December 1908 or January 1909.{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=310}} In curator Charles Hill's investigation, he noted that Thomson is listed in the ''Toronto City Directory'' for 1906–09 as working with Legg Bros. Photo Engravers, in 1910 merely as an artist living at 99 Gerrard E., and in 1911 as being at Grip Ltd. Hill supposes that this means Thomson likely began at Grip in late 1909, after the information for the 1910 directory was collected.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 113 n. 16}}}} The firm specialized in design and lettering work.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=113}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=50}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#graphic-design-in-toronto 9]}} Grip was the leading graphic design company in the country and introduced [[Art Nouveau]], [[Steel engraving|metal engraving]] and the [[CMYK color model|four-colour process]] to Canada.{{sfnb|King|2010|p=14}} Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that when he first hired Thomson, "his samples consisted mostly of lettering and decorative designs applied to booklet covers and some labels."{{sfnb|Robson|1932|p=138}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=3}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Advertising or Calendar drawing.jpg|thumb|''Advertising or calendar drawing'', Fall-winter 1912. Location unknown]]

The techniques he learned regarding Art Nouveau became apparent in many of his later works,{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=94, 210}}{{sfnb|Reid|2002|pp=65–83}} including paintings like ''Northern River''; ''[[:File:Tom Thomson Decorative Landscape, Birches.jpg|Decorative Landscape, Birches]]''; ''Spring Ice'' and ''The West Wind''.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=59–60}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} Of particular note are the sinuous forms typical within the art style,{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/the-west-wind 47], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}} seen in the "S-curves" of the trees which have their origins in Thomson's work as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}} Fellow artist [[A. Y. Jackson]] affirmed the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]'s tendency towards using Art Nouveau styles within their work, writing that, "We (the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson) treated our subjects with the freedom of designers. We tried to emphasize colour, line and pattern."{{sfnb|McKay|2011|p=185}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#commercial-art 71]}}

The senior artist at Grip, [[J. E. H. MacDonald]], encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills.{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=1}} MacDonald had perhaps the largest influence on Thomson's career as a painter; he enticed Thomson away from the commercial field and brought him towards painting through not only the encouraged weekend outdoor sketching, but through painting trips on holidays and introducing him to his fellow artists.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=117}} MacDonald himself credited William Broadhead with Thomson's emergence as a painter, writing in a letter to [[Arthur Lismer]] that "My memories in connection with Tom seem to begin with B[roadhead]."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}} In a draft of an article, [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] similarly credited Broadhead with Thomson's emergence.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Mortimer-Lamb|1919}} Lismer took exception to their claims, instead crediting MacDonald.{{sfnb|Lismer|1919}} A. Y. Jackson also expressed that Thomson's major development came after his ventures to Algonquin Park, rather than his time as a graphic designer.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1924}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1933}} Lismer later wrote, {{quote|[J. E. H.] MacDonald was the most important influence on Tom Thomson at this stage. These young artists (MacDonald, [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]], Tom McLean, Frederick Varley, Franklin Carmichael and Lismer) worked hard all week and sketched on Saturdays and Sundays. On Monday it was MacDonald in his corner seat who gave his opinion on sketches and offered philosophical encouragement. He was already recognized as a Canadian artist. Thomson in 1911 had not tried his hand at sketching out of doors. Perhaps it was that hitherto he did not feel he could do anything with the medium of oil painting, or... he was not ready to emerge. It was in the summer and fall 1911 that Thomson first emerged as a sketcher. His first efforts were primitive. They had a child[-like] quality, but like a child's work, with good quality and character. It was in the country around Toronto, on the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]], in the bush near [[York Mills]] and on excursions into the country around [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] and [[Lake Scugog|L&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;ake&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Scugog]] where he and others went fishing that Thomson first painted.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=115}}{{sfnb|Lismer|c. 1942}}}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired his first sketching equipment,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}} but spent most of his trip fishing,{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|pp=25–26}} save for "a few notes, skylines and colour effects."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=118}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1931}} Dating sketches to this trip has sometimes proved difficult.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}} One exception is the sketch ''Smoke Lake, Algonquin Park'', easily dated because Thomson gave it to Bud Callighen around the time of their first meeting.{{sfnb|Northway|1970|p=6}}{{sfnb|Addison|1974|p=75}}{{sfnb|Davies|1935|pp=35–36}} Charles Hill has also included the "somewhat awkward" ''Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park'' as likely being made during the trip.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}} Robson identified ''Drowned Land'' as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=6}} Also dated to this time are ''The Canoe'' and ''A Northern Lake'' (1912).{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In fall 1912 Thomson left Grip Ltd. to join another design firm, Rous &amp; Mann.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=58}}{{sfnb|Klages|2016|p=23}} Leonard Rossell went on to write, "Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies... Tom Thomson, so far as a I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park."{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=57–58}}{{sfnb|Rossell|c. 1951|p=3}}

In October 1912 Thomson was first introduced to Dr. [[James MacCallum]], a frequent visitor of the [[Ontario Society of Artists]]' (OSA) exhibitions and [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=375}} MacCallum convinced Thomson to leave his position at Rous and Mann and commit to a career in painting.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} [[Lawren Harris]] later recalled Thomson's major developments around this time:

{{quote|Thomson began to develop. His work commenced to emerge into the clear Canadian daylight. His work had been tight and sombre, almost a grey monotone in colour. [[A. Y. Jackson|&lt;nowiki&gt;[A. Y.]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Jackson]]'s sparkling, vibrant, rich colour opened his eyes, as it did the eyes of the rest of us, and Tom saw the Canadian landscape as he had never seen it before. It amounted to a revelation. From then on nothing could hold him.{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=212}}{{sfnb|Harris|1964}}{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}}}

MacCallum offered to cover Thomson's expenses for a year on the promise that he fully commited himself to painting,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=21}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 11]}} an offer Thomson eventually accepted after some initial hesitance.{{sfnb|Jackson|1933}} MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their "truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places." He further wrote that Thomson's paintings were "dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects."{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=376}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Birches.jpg|thumb|''Birches'', Fall 1913. [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]], [[University of Toronto]], Toronto]]

Thomson's ventures to the wilderness of Ontario were major sources of inspiration in his art, writing in a letter to MacCallum that the beauty of Algonquin Park was indescribable.{{sfnb|Thomson|1914}} His early works, such as ''Northern Lake'' (1912–13) and ''Evening'' were not outstanding technically, yet they illustrate a particular talent for composition and colour handling.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#thomsons-early-paintings 11]}} The sale of the former to the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario Government]] in March 1913 for $250 ({{Inflation|CA|250|1914|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=[[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]}}) allowed him to spend more time in the summer and fall of 1913 sketching.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#painting-full-time 12]}}{{sfnb|Stacey|2002|p=60}} MacCallum described the painting as a "picture [of] one of the small northern lakes swept by a north west wind; a squall just passing from the far shore, the water crisp, sparkingly blue &amp; broken into short, white-caps—a picture full of light, life and vigour."{{sfnb|MacCallum|1918|p=376}} Thomson's sketches from 1913 are often grey, but display greater colour handling than that seen in the earlier sketch of ''Northern Lake''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#thomsons-early-paintings 11]}} Most of these sketches are simple with a far off shore.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}} Canvases like ''Morning Cloud'' and ''Moonlight'' use broken brushwork, a technique he likely learned from MacDonald and Jackson.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=123}}

====Colour and experimentation (1914–15)====

Thomson often experienced self-doubt, with A. Y. Jackson recalling that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration,{{sfnb|Davies|1935|pp=74–75}}{{sfnb|Jackson|1958|p=31}} and was "so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches."{{sfnb|Jackson|1917}} While his work from this period still displays "a certain awkwardness," Thomson surpassed his colleagues Jackson and Lismer in his brilliance of colour.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=127}} In a letter to MacCallum, Jackson wrote,

{{quote|Tom seems quite enthusiastic and I expect is quite an inspiring man to work with. You need a man with you who tries to do the impossible. To do what you know is easily within your powers never has given rise to a great school of art or anything else.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=34}}}}

The sketches produced in 1915 display his increasing tendency towards experimentation and his sensitivity to colour,{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=133}} experimenting with texture and colour in ways that his earlier subdued and precise work had avoided.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=127}} Beyond his work as a colourist, he developed a technique of presenting contradictory ideas that were simultaneously resolved within the same image. Typically he accomplished this by using the techniques of both [[Tonalism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]], later achieving it by joining decorative patterns with bold handling.{{sfnb|Murray|1999|p=70}} Jackson wrote regarding this period of Thomson's work, "No longer handicapped by literal representation, he was transposing, eliminating, designing, experimenting, finding happy colour motives amid tangle and confusion and [reveling] in paint. The amount of work he did was incredible."{{sfnb|Jackson|1919}}

Over the 1915–16 winter in Toronto, Thomson produced several canvases, including ''In the Northland''; ''The Birch Grove, Autumn''; ''Autumn's Garland''; ''Opulent October'' and ''Spring Ice''. The sketches of his work display a two-dimensionality. Thomson's work from this period—like the works of Harris, Lismer and MacDonald—became more decorative. The colour is heightened, with spaces flattened and forms arranged into vertical bands. The branches and trunks of trees are more stylized in nature.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the large number of snow studies he produced at this time.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=137}} He produced many sketches which varied in composition, though they all had vivid colour and were applied thickly.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 16]}} Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career,{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=20}} writing in a letter that he "got quite a lot done."{{sfnb|Thomson|1917b}} It was during this time that he produced many of what became his most famous works, including ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' and ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]''.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#at-full-speed 17]}}

In the last two years of his life especially, Thomson was particularly skilled in observing atmospheric phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, wind and light.{{sfnb|Silcox|2018|p=181}} Work from this period—such as ''The Rapids''—demonstrate his adeptness at controlling colour and are painted with a particular "crispness and freshness."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=141}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17]}} Other paintings—such as ''Path Behind Mowat Lodge'' and ''Tea Lake Dam''—illustrate his bold and expressive brushstrokes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17–18]}} The scale of Thomson's later canvases foreshadow the Algoma canvases the members of the Group of Seven painted after the war.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=139}} [[Art history|Art historians]] David Silcox and [[Harold Town]] have described this period of Thomson's art as moving in the direction of [[abstract art|abstraction]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#final-spring 17–18], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 44], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 52], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-group-of-seven 57], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#the-canadian-documentary-tradition 62], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#an-idiosyncratic-palette 73]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}}{{efn|group=note|For more regarding Thomson's later abstract tendencies, refer to: {{bulleted list|{{harvp|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43–44]}}|{{harvp|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=148–49}}|{{section link|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Approaching abstraction}}}}}}

===Approaching abstraction===
{{Quote box|width=20em|align=right|quote="At the time of his death a perturbed Thomson was poised at the crevasse between [[figurative art|figurative]] and [[abstract art|non-figurative art]]. Whether he would have survived the jump is a matter of conjecture; that he would have jumped is, to me at least, a certainty."|source=—[[Harold Town]]{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 51]}}}}

Thomson was prolific in the number of sketches he produced—over four hundred across his entire career—providing an opportunity to observe the trends and progression of his style. Starting as a landscape painter, he drew away from typical landscape convention and began to experiment with more excited brushstrokes, clashing paint and more vibrant colours.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43]}} For artist and Thomson biographer Harold Town, the brevity of Thomson's career hinted at an artistic evolution never fully realized. He cites the 1916 oil painting ''Unfinished Sketch'' as "the first completely abstract work in Canadian art," a painting that, whether or not it was intended as a purely non-objective work, presages the innovations of [[abstract expressionism]].{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=148–49}} Town describes the contents of the painting as being a sky that expresses the frustration Thompson must have experienced in adding paint to the small areas between trees, rocks and thickets.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}} He similarly describes ''Late Autumn'' as being another "impatient study" that led to abstract experiment. Of particular importance are the areas between the branches, which are "brusquely smacked into place," as well as a similar foreground to that of ''Unfinished Sketch''.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=148}}

[[File:Thomson Unfinished Sketch.jpg|thumb|''Unfinished Sketch'', Fall 1916. Private collection{{efn|group=note|The painting is on the reverse of ''Algonquin Hillside, Snow''.}}]]
David Silcox has pointed to ''Cranberry Marsh'' as indicating Thomson's move towards abstraction.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/cranberry-marsh 43–44], [https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/style-and-technique/#diverse-influences 68]}} He has also viewed ''After the Storm'', likely one of Thomson's last paintings, as an indication that Thomson was already responding to the changes happening in Western art, even if he didn't exactly know where it would lead.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 51–52]}} Examining the painting more closely, the landscape itself dissolves into bare strokes and pure abstraction.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/after-the-storm 52]}}

[[Art history|Art historian]] [[Joan Murray (art historian)|Joan Murray]] has expressed reluctance to describe Thomson's sketches as "abstract," given that some of them may have likely been intended as "colour notes for use in the studio," and because some of the sketches were unfinished.{{sfnb|Murray|2015|loc="From the Studio Building to Algonquin Park and Home Again"}}

A '''book town''' is a town or village with a large number of [[used book]] or antiquarian [[Used bookstore|book stores]]. These [[Bookselling|stores]], as well as [[literary festival]]s, attract [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] tourists. A number of the book towns are members of the International Organisation of Book Towns.

'''''Charing Cross Bridge''''' is a series of [[oil painting]]s by [[France|French]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. Painted in between 1899 and 1904, they depict a misty, [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] [[Charing Cross Bridge]] in London.

==Historical information==
During the years between 1899 and 1905, Monet travelled to London to capture its sights from the fifth-floor balcony of the [[Savoy Hotel]]. Monet was captivated by the [[pea soup fog|London fog]], a notable atmospheric effect made markedly worse by the heavy pollution of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He painted the [[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|Houses of Parliament]], [[Waterloo Bridge]], and Charing Cross Bridge over and over, as he had earlier done with [[Haystacks (Monet)|haystacks]] and [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]], dashing off paintings to capture fleeting atmospheric effects. He was extremely prolific, beginning nearly 100 paintings in London.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven of the canvases were of Charing Cross Bridge, only twelve of which he finished in London; the rest he took back to his [[Giverny]] studio for completion.&lt;ref name=thyssen/&gt;

==Locations==
The ''Charing Cross Bridge'' paintings are scattered in collections all around the world. The unfinished canvas held by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] was once derided by [[Terry Teachout]] in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as second-rate, proof that "even a master can have his off days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMA has "second-rate art"?|url=http://eyeonindianapolis.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html|publisher=Eye on Indianapolis|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions are at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge, London, 1901|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/16544|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge|url=http://www.artbma.org/annualreport/2009/leadership/monet.html|publisher=[[Baltimore Museum of Art]]|accessdate=29 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107200220/http://www.artbma.org/annualreport/2009/leadership/monet.html|archivedate=7 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charing Cross Bridge (overcast day), 1900|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/charing-cross-bridge-overcast-day-1900-34284|publisher=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Harvard Museum of Fine Art, the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Monet, Charing Cross Bridge, Fog|url=http://www.ago.net/claude-monet-charing-cross-bridge-fog|publisher=[[Art Gallery of Ontario]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]&lt;ref name=thyssen&gt;{{cite web|title=Claude Monet Charing Cross Bridge 1899|url=http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/677|publisher=[[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Madrid]].

'''''Chop Suey''''' (1929) is a painting by [[Edward Hopper]]. The foreground of the work portrays two women in conversation at a restaurant. In November 2018, it was sold at a record price for the artist's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/arts/design/hopper-painting-christies-auction.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage|title=Hopper Painting Sells for Record $91.9 Million at Christie's|publisher=|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCSale"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46205604 |title=Hopper's Chop Suey in record-breaking $92m sale |work=BBC News |accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject== 
The scene depicts two women at a table in a restaurant with another couple in the background. The only features being shown in particular detail are the painted woman’s face, the coat hanging above her, her companion’s back [to the viewer], the features of the couple in the background, the tea pot on the table, the masked lower window panel, and the restaurant sign outside. These are all features that would bring a sensory element (besides sight) to the memory painted. The buzzing noise of the outside light, the voices of the people in the background, the texture of the coat, the taste of the tea and smell of the cigarette smoke (held by the man) and the muddled light from the masked window. 

Edward Hopper’s artwork is known for its realistic scenes that touch themes of isolation and self-being rather than a narrative context. He often described his art as a “transcription [of his] most intimate impressions of nature” meaning he related the process of painting to that of memory.{{sfn|Hopper|1933}} This idea could further be described in another way as when, for example, you draw something from a personal memory, certain details can be remembered but everything outside the primary focus is blank background. Chop Suey captures this concept of memory, making the viewer focus on particular elements of sensory iconography whilst depicting a theme of isolation due to self being.

==Interpretation== 
According to art scholar David Anfam, one "striking detail of ''Chop Suey'' is that its female subject faces her [[doppelgänger]]."{{sfn|Wagstaff|2004|p=39}} Others have pointed out it would not be so unusual for two women to be wearing similar hats, and that it is presumptuous to claim doppelgängers when one  subject's face is not visible to the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

By detailing only the sensory iconography, the painting takes a step back from pure realism, as if by painting the complete memory you are also destroying the fine details that make it actively realistic. Rolf G. Renner, author of “Hopper” states that, “…part of what [Hopper’s] pictures are ‘about’ is that death or decay which all paintings in some sense represent, since they destroy the immediacy of perception through the transformation into an image”.{{sfn|Renner|2002|p=65}}
	
Although the scene of the painting takes place in a social environment there is the sense of loneliness prevalent. The woman in green facing the viewer is sitting with her companion but she does not seem to be interacting with her. As with the couple in the background, the man looks withdrawn from the woman he sits across from. Every human figure is isolated and withdrawn from one another and reserved within themselves. This is portrayed with hidden or obscured faces, retracting a human essence from the figures. This further applies to the woman in detail; even though we get a full view of her face there is a detachment to her because of her stark makeup.

The alabaster skin with the bold rouge and painted lip suggest only the impression of a woman, similar to a doll, it only suggests the appearance of a girl. Normally in context with the style of the era (late 1920s), this could be taken as a trendy and lively style, “the women's tight-fitting sweaters, cloche hats, and made-up faces, which in a previous era would have marked them as sexually available, had become mainstream”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The viewer interprets her to be “spacing out”or listening un-intently rather than making eye contact and interacting with the viewer, as if she is not focused on her surroundings.{{sfn|Updike|2005|p=188}}
	
The composition of Chop Suey further encompasses Hopper’s concept memory as opposed to complete realism. The balance is held across the middle section of the painting with there being more un-detailed areas just above the eye line of sight, these areas are marked with rougher brush marks. The negative/ un-detalied space in the background further add to this because the eye simply passes over them and focuses more on the details presented. These spaces are simple because they are the background features that were not committed to memory. There is “weight” held in the presence of details contained between the figures at the tables all the way to the details in the design of the sign outside, the hanging jacket and the lower window covering. This gives the effect of the viewer seeing the scene and all the important aspects, ignoring the exterior context.  This is described in an article by [[USA Today Magazine]]: “The brief interruption in action, the mask-like face of the protagonist, and the abstract geometries in the windows contribute to the sense that the unfolding narrative is not about these specific actions or this place, but rather about a modern state of being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

With this in mind the viewer can assume the narrative behind this particular memory. In a bibliography by [[Gail Levin (art historian)|Gail Levin]], the location of Chop Suey is described, “…the setting recalled the inexpensive, second floor Chinese restaurant the Hoppers had been frequenting in Columbus Circle”.{{sfn|Levin|1995|p=221}} This might explain the primary focus on the woman (possibly his wife, Jo) and the dullness of the surroundings. If it was a place Edward Hopper had frequently visited then there would be no reason to concentrate on the surroundings, but rather the moment of the scene.

==Sale==
[[Barney A. Ebsworth]] owned the painting and had promised it to the [[Seattle Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1463492/sale-of-edward-hopper-painting-chop-suey-sparks-controversy/|title=The Controversy Behind the $92 Million Sale of an Edward Hopper Painting|first1=Natasha|last1=Frost|website=qz.com|date=2018-11-14|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at his death, ownership transferred to his estate. In November of 2018, the painting sold for $92 million, a new record for a work by the artist.&lt;ref name="BBCSale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/arts/design/hopper-painting-christies-auction.html?emc=edit_th_181114&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=654736121114|title=Hopper Painting Sells for Record $91.9 Million at Christie’s|author=Scott Reyburn|work=The New York Times|date=2018-11-13|accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreations==
A [[bumper (media)|bumper]] played on the cable channel [[Turner Classic Movies]], titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvz1qjVwso8 ''The Sunny Side of Life''], was inspired by ''Chop Suey'' and other Hopper paintings.

The '''Church of the Holy Crucifix''' (or ''church of Saint Francis of Paola'') is a [[Catholic church]] in [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

There is the ''[[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy [[Crucifix]]'', which in 1565 got the benefit of ''[[Fiera Franca]]'' from the [[count of Modica]].&lt;ref name=tra&gt;http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=146&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjoining the church there was the ''Friary of saint [[Francis of Paola]]''.

==Foundation==
It was founded in 1550 in the name of the Most Holy Crucifix by the nobleman [[Pietro Tabone]], grandfather of the poet [[Sebastiano Bagolino]]’s, who was buried in this Church.&lt;ref name=tra/&gt;
In 1542 Tabone, after his request, had a piece of land by the municipality in order to build a [[Chapel]] dedicated to the Most Holy Crucifix, [[patron saint]] of the town at that time.

==History==
The small chapel was built in 1550, without any consent by the [[Bishop of Mazara del Vallo]]; it was approved only two years after its construction.  Tabone had the right to enlarge, pull down and rebuilt it, besides he could nominate the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] and found a [[Confraternity]] of the Most Holy Crucifix.&lt;ref name=parr&gt;"Parrocchia san Francesco di Paola"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1575 there was a terrible [[Plague (disease)|plague]]: the population in Alcamo, about 7,700, was cut in half, according to the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] and a lot of people were buried in the cemetery [[Sant'Ippolito]], in the western suburb. 
As the old hospitals of ''San Vito'' and ''Santo Spirito'' were not sufficient to receive so many plague victims, they set up a new one in the same street of the Chapel.

Owing to their economic difficulties which did not allow to complete the Church, in 1596 the administrators of the Confraternity decided to assign the Church to the [[Order of Minims]] of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1608 the Minims accepted the donation and built the adjoining [[friary]] which they maintained until 1866;  since 1870 it hosted the Royal [[Gimnasium]], and,  after 1870, the [[Civic Hospital]].
[[File:Interni della chiesa di San Francesco di Paola (Alcamo) 02.jpg|thumb|Interior of the church]]

The Minim Fathers distinguished themselves both for their religious activity and for the [[social engagement]] for the quarter;  in 1780 forty-five priests from Alcamo signed a request to king [[Ferdinand III of Sicily|Ferdinand III]] asking not to suppress the friary, as it had happened to other religious orders some years before. The [[cloister]] was not closed, but after the [[Unification of Italy]], [[Vittorio Emanuele II]], [[king of Italy]], abolished all religious orders and their properties were seized. 
Finally in 1926 the Church became a [[parish]], dedicated to [[saint Francis of Paola]].

==Works==

The [[façade]], dated 1695,  has a convex form, a typical characteristic of [[Rococo Style]].
The church is with one [[nave]] and has five altars; in 1750 it was embellished with [[stucco]]es by [[Nicolò Curti]].

Inside it there the following works:
[[File:Statua di San Francesco di Paola (Alcamo) 01.jpg|thumb|Altar of saint Francis of Paola]]
On the high altar: the [[Crucifix]], a [[wooden]] sculpture made in the 19th century, made by [[Francesco Marino]] from [[Trapani]].

On the left side:
* The [[Holy Trinity]] (by an unknown author), with the two [[San Cosma e Damiano|saints Cosma e Damiano]], [[Saint Rosalia]] and [[Saint Francis of Sales]] (1750), first canvas on the right side of the chapel
* [[Our Lady of Fatima]], a recent [[wooden]] statue 
* [[Saint Blaise]], by an unknown author of the 18th century, coming from the [[Church of the Annunciation (Alcamo)|Church of the Annunciation]] 
* The [[Holy Heart of Jesus]] (Sacro Cuore di Gesù), a wooden statue, placed in 1921

On the right side:
* [[Our Lady of Miracles]] (Madonna dei Miracoli), with Saint Francis of Paola and Saint Francis of Sales (1750), made by an unknown author
* [[Saint Francis of Paola]], a [[wooden]] statue, probable work of [[Filippo Quattrocchi]] from [[Gangi, Sicily|Gangi]] (18th century)
* [[Saint Anne]], a wooden statue (end of the 19th century) which has replaced a ruined painting made in 1618 by [[Giuseppe Carrera]]
* The [[Immaculate]], a recent [[plaster cast]] statue
* [[Saint Vitus]], a wooden statue made in 1848
* A [[holy water stoup]], carved in 1606 by [[Giuseppe Foti]]: at the church entrance.
On the nave walls there are four old paintings, by an unknown author and with stucco frames, representing some episodes of Saint Francis of Paola’s life:
* The miracle happened during the building of the friary at [[Paternò Calabro]] ([[province of Cosenza]]) in 1454: two workers had died owing to a [[landslide]] and were resurrected by the Saint (the first on the right).&lt;ref name=parr/&gt;
* The wonderful miracle of the fish made by saint Francis of Paola (the second painting on the right)
* A nobleman's family presents their baby without eyes and mouth; once again saint Francis makes an extraordinary miracle (first painting on the left wall);
* The conversion of the [[King of Naples]], due to the Saint (second painting on the left).
* The founding of the Hebraic Easter ([[book of Exodus]]), on the right wall of the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament;
* The banquet given by [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] to two Angels ([[book of Genesis]]), a painting on the left wall in the same chapel;

In the sacristy:
* The [[Crucifix]] made in mistura, by [[Giovanni Matinati]] (1550)
* [[Saint Lucy]], a 17th-century statue by an unknown author;
* [[Saint Expeditus]], a recent statue

[[File:Thompson laingsnek.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Thompson|Lady Butler]], ''Floreat Etona!'', 1882]]

'''''Floreat Etona!''''' is an 1882 painting by [[Elizabeth Thompson]], Lady Butler.  The title is the motto of [[Eton College]], "may Eton flourish".  The painting depicts an incident in 1881, during the [[First Boer War]].

The work depicts Lieutenant [[Robert Elwes]] of the [[Grenadier Guards]], who was killed at the [[Battle of Laing's Nek]] on 28 January 1881.  The British Army was attempting to force its way through a pass in the [[Drakensberg Mountains]], when Elwes joined a hopeless frontal assault into the teeth of a formidable Boer defence, charging up a hill on horseback.  He reported encouraging another Eton old boy, adjutant of the [[58th Regiment of Foot]], with a shout of "Come along Monck! Floreat Etona! We must be in the front rank!" immediately before he was shot and killed.  Elwes was one of 83 killed and 11 wounded. Monck survived the battle.

The painting shows two mounted British officers in blue patrol jackets, with swords drawn, leading red-coated infantry in a charge towards the viewer. The horse to the right bearing Monck) is stumbling, and the officer to the left (Elwes) shouts encouragement.  A [[Queen's Colour]] is visible in the background - this attack was the last time a British battalion carried its colours into action - and the flat-topped mountain of [[Majuba]] in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]].

The painting measures {{convert|84.4|xx|78.1|cm}}.   It was shown at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1882.  Unusually for Lady Butler, the painting was not a critical success, perhaps because it commemorates a minor and unsuccessful incident in an unregarded war.  Some critics thought the painting was too sentimental.

The painting was sold at Christie's in London in June 2007 for £50,400.

The '''Fresh Fruit Festival''' is a publicly supported&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id={70BDAACC-A2DD-4E6D-8706-1578D5B2002B}|title=Charities Division NY State|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, New York summer arts festival presented by All Out Arts, and featuring the work of [[LGBTQ]] artists as the primary expression of the All Out Arts mission of "Fighting prejudice and homophobia through the arts."  It presents a multi-week main-stage presentation every July, and ancillary events year-round. 

==History==

The Festival was founded by Carol Polcovar in 2002 as a merger of New Village Playwrights and New Village Productions reacted to a current reluctance on the part of major venues to present a truly representative array of LGBT arts. Originally sponsored by All Out Arts, Inc., a 501(c)(3) NY State non-profit since 1991, it shortly became a fully owned D.B.A. of All Out Arts. The Festival includes a wide range of plays, visual arts, dance, and film presentations. Along with the [[Hot! Festival]], it is among the most prominent LGBT-themed festivals in the New York artistic community. Carol Polcovar served as Founding Artistic Director of the festival for its first decade, and upon retirement in 2013 accepted an "Outstanding Achievement" Award for the Fresh Fruit Festival's mission from the Manhattan Borough President's Office.&lt;ref&gt;"I honor your commitment to the arts as a profoundly effective weapon against all forms of prejudice." -May 15, 2013- Gale A. Brewer, Borough President of Manhattan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancillary programs==

The Festival presented the first of several "OUTmusic" programs in New York City, consisting entirely of vocalists, musicians, and composers who were Lesbian, Gay, Bi, or Transgendered. As  Outmusic became an organization, All Out Arts served as their fiscal conduit and aided their becoming a unique organization. Outmusic is now a national foundation, sponsoring National Outmusic Awards since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outmusicawards.com/|title=Outmusic Awards The Biggest Night In LGBT Music &amp; Entertainment|website=Outmusic Awards The Biggest Night In LGBT Music &amp; Entertainment|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Festival presented the first event solely dedicated to and entirely by LGBT Native Americans. Native American elder Kent Lebsock presided over the opening convocation, and the event included members of the Cherokee, Mohawk, Chikasaw, Navajo, Creek , Lakota, Kumeyaay and Cree tribes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tafoya|first1=Patrick|title=Roger Kuhn: A Two-Spirit Evening Proves Two Is Better Than One|journal=Talking Stick - Native Arts Quarterly|date=October 2006|issue=9.4 Oct/Nov/Dec 2006|url=http://amerinda.org/talkingstick/9-4/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival produces an annual winter OUT-wright Program, which facilitates developmental readings by LGBT authors, underwriting the expense of such events, as well as presenting lecture-demonstrations and public panels featuring published LGBT authors and poets.

'''''Frozen''''' is a 2010 American [[thriller film|thriller]]-[[drama film]] written and directed by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] and starring [[Emma Bell]], [[Shawn Ashmore]] and [[Kevin Zegers]].

==Plot==
Childhood friends Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, along with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neil, spend a Sunday afternoon at a New England ski resort on Mount Holliston. They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.

The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.

They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.

After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a [[compound fracture]] on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and [[steel]] support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.

In the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe [[frostbite]]. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.

The next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse. Too occupied with Joe's corpse, they ignore her as she continues down, eventually crawling to a nearby road.

The first car that passes doesn't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver, seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road, stops to assist her. The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital, followed by Parker closing her eyes.

==Reception==

===Critical===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 62% of 91 surveyed critics gave it a positive review, and the average rating was 5.8/10; the site's consensus is: "Writer/director Adam Green has the beginnings of an inventive, frightening yarn in ''Frozen'', but neither the script nor the cast are quite strong enough to truly do it justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012051-frozen|title=Frozen|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Richard Roeper]] called the film "an entertaining, suspense-filled, sometimes wonderfully grotesque little scarefest",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-12DB0F1256971C90.html|title=Three friends face a final deep freeze|last=Roeper|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Roeper|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2010-02-05|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' commented that it "is not written, directed, or acted well enough to be a first-rate thriller".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/frozen-film-review-29199|title=Frozen -- Film Review|last=Greenberg|first=James|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2010-10-14|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' made it a NYT Critics' Pick and wrote, "A minimalist setup delivers maximum fright in ''Frozen'', a nifty little chiller that balances its cold terrain with an unexpectedly warm heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/movies/05frozen.html?partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes&amp;ei=5083&amp;_r=0|title=A Nightmare on a Ski Lift|last=Catsoulis|first=Jeannette|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-02-04|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Don’t be surprised if the movie’s most wince-inducing moments come not from the "disturbing images" (as the MPAA describes the sight of a leg bone sticking six inches out of one character's ski pants) but rather of the bad acting and worse dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/frozen-1117942010/|title=Review: 'Frozen'|last=Debruge|first=Peter|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Sophia O'Hara''' (1846 - 1920) was a [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] watercolour artist.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Helen Sophia O'Hara was born in The Castle [[Portstewart]], [[County Londonderry]], in 1846. She was the daughter of the Reverend James D. O'Hara. Her brother, H.S. O'Hara was the Bishop of Cashel and Emly, and [[Lismore, County Waterford]].&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; She lived with her friend and fellow artist [[Fanny Currey]] at the Mall, Lismore, from 1898 until 1919. It is believed that O'Hara received no formal training and was self-taught.&lt;ref name=MacNally&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacNally|first1=Niamh|title=A Subtle Art|url=http://archive.irishartsreview.com/irisartsrevi2002/pdf/2004/25503087.pdf.bannered.pdf|website=Irish Arts Review|accessdate=23 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724031252/http://archive.irishartsreview.com/irisartsrevi2002/pdf/2004/25503087.pdf.bannered.pdf|archivedate=24 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Waterford in 1920.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt;
 
==Artistic work==
[[File:'DANCING CHILDREN' BY HELEN O'HARA RUA.jpg|left|thumb|Dancing Children by O'Hara]]
O'Hara was a watercolour painter, whose work centred on landscapes and seascapes, as well as flower painting. She exhibited with the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] from 1881 to 1894. She was a member of the [[Royal Ulster Academy|Belfast Art Society]] (BAS), and although she retired in 1895, she was elected vice-president in 1896. Whilst living in Lismore with Currey, O'Hara illustrated a number of Currey's children's books. Her work was exhibited with the [[Society of Women Artists]], the [[Dudley Museum and Art Gallery|Dudley Gallery]], and the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]].&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; She exhibited over 100 artworks, landscapes and seascapes, with the [[Water Colour Society of Ireland]] from 1892 to 1913.&lt;ref name=MacNally /&gt; O'Hara was elected an honorary member of the BAS in 1904 along with [[Mildred Anne Butler]], [[John Lavery]], and [[Frank Spenlove-Spenlove]]. The [[Ulster Museum]] holds a number of her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia A.|title=Three Hundred Years of Irish Watercolours and Drawings|date=1997|publisher=Phoenix Illustrated|location=London|isbn=0753802066|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Immaculate Conception with Saints''''' (also known as ''The Incarnation of Jesus'') is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Piero di Cosimo]], executed between 1485 and 1505.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/inv1890/ Uffizi Gallery (search for inventory number '506')]&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

The painting  was executed for the Tebaldi Chapel in the church of [[Annunziata, Florence|the Annunziata]] of Florence, and was acquired by Cardinal [[Leopoldo de' Medici]]  in 1670. It was moved to the Uffizi in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Fossi, ''Galleria degli Uffizi - Arte storia collezioni'', p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work shows the Virgin in a central and illuminated position, with a dove hovering above her head. She is flanked by the Saints [[John the Apostle|John the Evangelist]], [[Philip Benizi de Damiani|Philip Benizi]], [[Catherine_of_Alexandria|Catherine]] (kneeling on the left), [[Margaret the Virgin|Margaret]] (kneeling on the right), [[Antoninus of Florence|Antoninus]] and [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. In the background is a typical Piero's landscape, with two hills characterized by rock with human and beast appearance, where the other scenes of the ''Adoration of the Magi'', the ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' on the left and the ''Flight to Egypt'' on the right are depicted.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxxi,1}} Beyond the digital aspect, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include [[design]], [[human–computer interaction]], and [[software development]]. While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|1}} Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

While disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders,  &lt;!-- re-read sections in Inmates are running the asylum for citations: When designing to meet the needs and desires of users as opposed to technical stake holders, the results are unequivocally different.... --&gt;interaction design is geared toward satisfying the majority of users.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

== History ==
The term ''interaction design'' was coined by [[Bill Moggridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soa-busmodeling/index.html|title=Integrate business modeling and interaction design|date=8 June 2007|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212063437/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soa-busmodeling/index.html|archivedate=12 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Verplank]] in the mid-1980s, but it took 10 years before other designers the concept started to take hold.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}} To Verplank, it was an adaptation of the computer science term ''user interface design'' for the [[industrial design]] profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billverplank.com/professional.html|title=Bill Verplank - Professional|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123153501/http://www.billverplank.com/professional.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Moggridge, it was an improvement over ''soft-face'', which he had coined in 1984 to refer to the application of industrial design to products containing software.&lt;ref name="DesigningInteractions"&gt;*{{cite book
|last=Moggridge
|first=Bill
|authorlink=Bill Moggridge
|title=Designing Interactions
|publisher=[[MIT Press]]
|year=2007
|isbn=0-262-13474-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Moggridge's book, ''Designing Interactions'' explores a number of prominent examples of interaction design (e.g., the [[input device]], laptop, handheld) and includes interviews with some of its best-known practitioners.--&gt;

The earliest programs in design for interactive technologies were the Visible Language Workshop, started by [[Muriel Cooper]] at MIT in 1975, and the [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] founded at NYU in 1979 by Martin Elton and later headed by Red Burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html|title=Red Burns, ‘Godmother of Silicon Alley,’ Dies at 88|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2013-08-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524195449/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html|archivedate=24 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic program officially named "Interaction Design" was established at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1994 as a Master of Design in Interaction Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.cmu.edu/show_program.php?s%3D2%26t%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130142448/http://www.design.cmu.edu/show_program.php?s=2&amp;t=3 |archivedate=30 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset, the program focused mainly on screen interfaces, before shifting to a greater emphasis on the "big picture" aspects of interaction—people, organizations, culture, service and system.

In 1990, Gillian Crampton Smith founded the Computer-related Design MA at the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London, changed in 2005 to Design Interactions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaction.rca.ac.uk RCA Design Interactions Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710032805/http://www.interaction.rca.ac.uk/ |date=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Anthony Dunne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design-interactions.rca.ac.uk/anthony-dunne RCA Design Interactions About Students Staff &amp; Guests Research Graduating Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205163817/http://www.design-interactions.rca.ac.uk/anthony-dunne |date=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Crampton Smith helped found the [[Interaction Design Institute Ivrea]], a small institute in [[Olivetti|Olivetti's]] hometown in Northern Italy, dedicated solely to interaction design. The institute moved to Milan in October 2005 and merged with [[Domus Academy, Postgraduate School of Design|Domus Academy]]. In 2007, some of the people originally involved with IDII set up the [[Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design]] (CIID). After Ivrea, Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor added the Interaction Design (IxD) track in the Visual and Multimedia Communication at Iuav, University of Venice, Italy, between 2006 and 2014.

In 1998, the [[Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research]] founded [[The Interactive Institute]]—a Swedish research institute in the field of interaction design.

==Methodologies==

===Goal-oriented design===
Goal-oriented design (or Goal-Directed design) "is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the users of a product or service."&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

[[Alan Cooper]] argues in ''The Inmates Are Running the Asylum'' that we need a new approach to solving interactive software-based problems.&lt;ref name="Inmates"&gt;{{cite book |title=Inmates Are Running the Asylum, The: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity |last=Cooper |first=Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Sams Publishing |location= |isbn=0-672-32614-0 |pages=288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The problems with designing computer interfaces are fundamentally different from those that do not include software (e.g., hammers).  Cooper introduces the concept of cognitive friction, which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult to use, and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly, possessing different modes.&lt;ref name="Inmates"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Alternatively, interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service/product provider. User needs may be poorly served by this approach.

===Usability===
Usability answers the question "can someone use this interface?". Jacob Nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|title=Usability 101: Introduction to Usability|author=|date=|website=nngroup.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901213207/https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|archivedate=1 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes how usable the interface is. Shneiderman proposes principles for designing more usable interfaces called "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/courses/360/f04/sessions/schneidermanGoldenRules.html|title=Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design|author=|date=|website=faculty.washington.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109012011/http://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/courses/360/f04/sessions/schneidermanGoldenRules.html|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which are well-known heuristics for creating usable systems.

===Personas===
[[Persona (user experience)|Personas]] are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users.&lt;ref name="Designing for the Digital Age"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Kim|title=Designing for the Digital Age|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-22910-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can understand, remember, and relate to. Personas use storytelling to engage users' social and emotional aspects, which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the recommended design is successful.&lt;ref name="Designing for the Digital Age"/&gt;

===Cognitive dimensions===
The [[cognitive dimensions]] framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Instructions and Descriptions: some cognitive aspects of programming and similar activities |author=T. R. G. Green |author-link=Thomas R.G. Green |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.32.8003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110729130302/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.32.8003 |archivedate=29 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a vocabulary to evaluate and modify design solutions. Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality, rather than an in-depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation, [[user interface]] or programming language design.

Dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it: examples include ''consistency'', ''error-proneness'', ''hard mental operations'', ''viscosity'' and ''premature commitment''. These concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through ''design maneuvers'' that alter the design within a particular dimension.

===Affective interaction design===
Designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses. For instance, products must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones.&lt;ref name="Sharp 2007"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Sharp
|first=Helen
|last2=Rogers
|first2=Yvonne
|last3=Preece
|first3=Jenny
|title=Interaction Design: Beyond Human–Computer Interaction
|edition=2nd
|pages=181–217 [184]
|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]
|year=2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important aspects include motivational, learning, creative, social and persuasive influences. One method that can help convey such aspects is for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help communicate, creating a sense of interactivity. Interface aspects such as fonts, color palettes and graphical layouts can influence acceptance. Studies showed that affective aspects can affect perceptions of usability.&lt;ref name="Sharp 2007"/&gt;

Emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses. These include [[Don Norman]]'s [[emotional design]] model, Patrick Jordan's pleasure model&lt;ref&gt;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/happiness/four_pleasures.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and McCarthy and Wright's Technology as Experience framework.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-experience&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Interaction cost}}

==Five dimensions==
The concept of dimensions of interaction design were introduced in Moggridge's book ''Designing Interactions.'' Crampton Smith wrote that interaction design draws on four existing design languages, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moggridge|first=Bill|title=Designing Interactions|year=2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-13474-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver later proposed a fifth dimension, behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Kevin|title=What Puts the Design in Interaction Design|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/07/what-puts-the-design-in-interaction-design.php|publisher=UX Matters|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115072245/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/07/what-puts-the-design-in-interaction-design.php|archivedate=15 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Words===

This dimension defines interactions: words are the element that users interact with.

===Visual representations===

Visual representations are the elements of an interface that the user perceives; these may include but are not limited to "typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics".

===Physical objects or space===

This dimension defines the objects or space "with which or within which users interact".

===Time===

The time during which the user interacts with the interface. An example of this includes "content that changes over time such as sound, video or animation".

===Behavior===

Behaviour defines and how user respond to the interface.

==Interaction Design Association==
The Interaction Design Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ixda.org/|title=Interaction Design Association – IxDA|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602161020/http://www.ixda.org/|archivedate=2 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2003 to serve the community.

:As interaction designers increasingly deal with [[ubiquitous computing]], [[urban informatics]] and [[urban computing]], the architects' ability to make, place, and create context becomes a point of contact between the disciplines.

;[[User interface design]]
:Like user interface design and [[experience design]], interaction design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time, with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user's experience and not the other way around.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Jo-ha-kyū'''''|序破急}} is a concept of modulation and movement applied in a wide variety of [[Japanese culture|traditional Japanese arts]]. Roughly translated to "beginning, break, rapid", it essentially means that all actions or efforts should begin slowly, speed up, and then end swiftly. This concept is applied to elements of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], to [[kendō]] and other martial arts, to [[dramatic structure]] in the traditional theatre, and to the traditional collaborative linked verse forms [[renga]] and [[renku]] (haikai no renga).

The concept originated in ''[[gagaku]]'' court music, specifically in the ways in which elements of the music could be distinguished and described. Though eventually incorporated into a number of disciplines, it was most famously adapted, and thoroughly analysed and discussed by the great [[Noh]] playwright [[Zeami]],&lt;ref&gt;Zeami. "Teachings on Style and the Flower (''[[Fūshikaden]]'')." from Rimer &amp; Yamazaki. ''On the Art of the Nō Drama''. p20.&lt;/ref&gt; who viewed it as a universal concept applying to the patterns of movement of all things.

==Theatre==
It is perhaps in the theatre that ''jo-ha-kyū'' is used the most extensively, on the most levels. Following the writings of Zeami, all major forms of Japanese traditional drama ([[Noh]], [[kabuki]], and ''[[bunraku|jōruri]]'') utilize the concept of ''jo-ha-kyū'', from the choice and arrangement of plays across a day, to the composition and pacing of acts within a play, down to the individual actions of the actors.

Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Shelley Fenno. "How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''." ''Monumenta Nipponica'', vol 48, issue 1 (Spring 1993). pp58-62&lt;/ref&gt;

This same concept was later adapted into ''jōruri'' and kabuki, where the plays are often arranged into five acts with  ''jo-ha-kyū'' in mind.  [[Takemoto Gidayū]], the great ''jōruri'' chanter, was the first to describe the patterns or logic behind the five acts, which parallel as well the five categories of Noh which would be performed across a day.&lt;ref name=Gerstle&gt;Gerstle, Drew (2001). ''Chikamatsu: Five Late Plays''. New York: Columbia University Press. pp16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described the first act as "Love"; the play opens auspiciously, using gentle themes and pleasant music to draw in the attention of the audience. The second act is described as "Warriors and Battles" (''[[Noh#Categories|shura]]''). Though it need not contain actual battle, it is generally typified by heightened tempo and intensity of plot. The third act, the climax of the entire play, is typified by pathos and tragedy. The plot achieves its dramatic climax. Takemoto describes the fourth act as a ''[[michiyuki]]'' (journey), which eases out of the intense drama of the climactic act, and often consists primarily of song and dance rather than dialogue and plot. The fifth act, then, is a rapid conclusion. All loose ends are tied up, and the play returns to an auspicious setting.&lt;ref name=Gerstle /&gt;

==Poetry==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
In 1356, it was [[Nijō Yoshimoto]] who established the sequential pattern of [[renga]], [[haikai]] and [[noh]] by requiring jo-ha-kyū for renga in his {{nihongo|[[Tsukubashū]]|菟玖波集}}&lt;ref&gt;Miner, Earl. ''Japanese Linked Poetry''. Princeton University Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-691-01368-3}} p21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klecksography''' is the art of making images from [[inkblot]]s.&lt;ref name="Lee1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Lee|title=The Name's Familiar: Mr. Leotard, Barbie, and Chef Boy-Ar-Dee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-tNsbAhFiIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1999|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-4556-0918-5|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was pioneered by [[Justinus Kerner]], who included klecksographs in his books of poetry.&lt;ref name="Richardson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John T. E. Richardson|title=Howard Andrew Knox: Pioneer of Intelligence Testing at Ellis Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toArWzNbBUAC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51211-4|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1890s, [[psychologist]]s have used it as a tool for studying the subconscious, most famously [[Hermann Rorschach]] in his [[Rorschach inkblot test]].

==Method==
Spots of ink are dropped onto a piece of paper and the paper is folded in half, so that the ink will smudge and form a mirror reflection in the two halves. The piece of paper is then unfolded so that the ink can dry, after which someone can guess the resemblance of the print to other objects. The inkblots tend to resemble images because of [[apophenia]], the human tendency to see patterns in nature.&lt;ref name="Geary2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Geary|title=I Is an Other: The Secret Life of Metaphor and How it Shapes the Way We See the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nALGZMTeN1oC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=26 June 2013|date=8 February 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-204177-7|pages=63–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kerner Kleksographien 07.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|A page of poetry and art from [[Justinus Kerner]]'s ''Klecksographien'' (1890)]]
Justinus Kerner invented this technique when he started accidentally dropping blots of ink onto paper due to failing eyesight. Instead of throwing them away, he found that intriguing shapes appeared if he unfolded the papers. He elaborated these shapes into intricate cartoons and used them to illustrate his poems. Kerner began a collection of klecksographs and poetry in 1857 titled ''Klecksographien''. His collection was not published until 1890 because of his death in 1862.

In 1896, a similar game was described in the United States by Ruth McEnery Stuart and Albert Bigelow Paine in a book titled ''Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures for Young and Old''. The book explained how to make inkblot monsters ("gobolinks") and use them as prompts for writing imaginative verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-MRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1897|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in psychology==

===Binet and Henri===
As early as 1895, [[Alfred Binet]] and his associate [[Victor Henri]] first suggested that inkblots might be used in psychological research, arguing that the interpretation of inkblots could be used to study variations in ‘involuntary imagination’.&lt;ref name="Richardson2011"/&gt;

===Rorschach===
As a child in [[Switzerland]], Hermann Rorschach enjoyed klecksography so much that his friends nicknamed him "Klecks", meaning "inkblot".&lt;ref name="Lee1999" /&gt; As a medical student, Rorschach studied under psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]], who had taught [[Carl Jung]]. In studying [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] work on [[Dream_symbolism#Freud|dream symbolism]], Rorschach was reminded of his youthful inkblot hobby. He then created his Rorschach test to see if people's reactions to inkblots could be used as a tool to uncover unconscious desires.&lt;ref name="Lee1999" /&gt; The test is essentially a visual variation on Freud's verbal technique.&lt;ref name="Geary2011" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{quotebox
|quote="I was wary of watching ''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' because the cartoon hasn't been true to its original spirit in the last few seasons. Episodes have been missing that special ingredient, if you will, that they had in early seasons. Recent specials, such as "[[The Great Patty Caper|Mystery with a Twistery]]" and "[[The Clash of Triton|Clash of the Tritons]]" were too slick, over-reaching and had only moments of the old brilliance. However, the episodes on ''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' are hilarious and destined to become favorites."

''Legends of Bikini Bottom'' received positive reviews from media critics. Nancy Basile of [[About.com]] positively reacted to the series and gave it a 4 out of 5 rating.&lt;ref name=Basile&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title='SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/fr/Legends-Of-Bikini-Bottom.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cited her favorite episodes like "Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Triangle" and "The Main Drain".&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; She said "Firstly, you know an episode will be funny when it's titled 'Bikini Bottom Triangle'. My children had no idea why I was laughing at the title frame."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; her favorite scenes from the episode were "Gary's booty, watching the old sea dog spit his story and figuring out why Patrick wears cuff links."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt; In another episode called "The Main Drain", she said "I won't ruin the set up because it's just so funny, but my favorite line is, 'It's now or never.' You have to see it to know why."&lt;ref name=Basile/&gt;

In his review for the [[DVD Talk]], Paul Mavis said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'' is all-new, and therein lies what has {{sic|becoming}} increasingly routine: haphazard quality. Some are mildly amusing, and others blow their promising set-ups."&lt;ref name=Mavis&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavis|first=Paul|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46762/spongebob-squarepants-legends-of-bikini-bottom/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added "Still, 'The Main Drain' and 'Trenchbillies' are fairly funny, while the magical warrior dolphin in 'Sponge-Cano!' may be worth the price of admission alone here."&lt;ref name=Mavis/&gt;

Danielle Sullivan of [[Babble.com]] said "My 13-year-old still loves ''SpongeBob'' and his quirky underwater friends, and I have to admit that the show makes me laugh a lot. It’s one of those unique blends that appeals to kids and parents." Michelle Lincaster of AllVoices, on the airing of the series on Facebook, said "''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has a 16,000,000 fan following on Facebook so the premiere of ''The Legends of Bikini Bottom'' on Facebook shouldn't come as a surprise."&lt;ref name=AllVoices/&gt;

Jeff Robbins of the [[DVD Verdict]] was mixed on the series and said "''SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom'', get ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''."&lt;ref name=Verdict&gt;{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Jeff|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=8 September 2013|date=12 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922024402/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendsbikinibottom.php|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing "The Monster Who Came to Bikini Bottom", he said "What is also notable here is the episode's ending, which features a brilliant call-back to an earlier seen flashback (more shades of ''Lost'') that ties up the threads of the episode as well as any [[Larry David]] penned half-hour. This first short is ''SpongeBob'' at its best." Robbins called "The Main Drain" as "Not a good episode." and "Sponge-Cano!" as "A strong segment."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt; In reviewing "The Curse of the Hex", Robbins said "Unfortunately, this lousy episode ends the disc on a sour note as a hagfish curses The [[Krusty Krab]]. The only notable aspect to this dull segment is that the hagfish is voiced by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Kristen Wiig]], which, depending on your current view of the comedy institution, may make the episode more or less interesting. Either the writers got tired of attempting allusions to ''Lost'' by this point, or I simply got tired of looking for them."&lt;ref name=Verdict/&gt;

This is a list of [[Royal Doulton]] [[Bunnykins]] figurines.  Doulton &amp; Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by [[Charles Noke]] based on illustrations by [[Mary Barbara Bailey|Sister Mary Barbara Bailey]].  Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton &amp; Co. discontinued their manufacture.  After Royal Doulton purchased the [[Beswick Pottery]] factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines.&lt;ref name=Irvine1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Louise|title=Royal Doulton Bunnykins Figures|date=1991|publisher=UK International Ceramics|location=England|isbn=0951777254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia.  The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued.

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Niagara''''' is an oil painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. ''Niagara'' was his most important work to date, and confirmed his reputation as the premier American landscape painter of the time.&lt;ref name="olana"/&gt; In his history of Niagara Falls, [[Pierre Berton]] writes, "Of the hundreds of paintings made of Niagara, before Church and after him, this is by common consent the greatest."&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;

==Background==
The Falls were commonly painted, being such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were "the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting".&lt;ref name="h69"&gt;Howat, 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the public was captivated by the natural wonder of the Falls, considered a landmark of the North American landscape and a major tourist destination. It was the "Honeymoon Capital of the World", and prints of Niagara were given as wedding gifts. In the 1850s, Niagara was the subject of millions of [[stereograph]]s, and its image could be found on wallpaper, china, and lamp shades, among other consumer items.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt;  In 1853, a 1600-foot [[moving panorama]] of Niagara Falls was exhibited in New York City.&lt;ref name="olana"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;pg=PA69 |title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church |last=Church |first=Frederic Edwin |last2=Avery |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Pataki |first3=George E. |date=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0801444306 |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Americans, the Falls symbolized the grandeur and expansionism of the United States. David C. Huntington, whose writing on Church in the 1960s revived interest in the painter, explained how Americans, in an era of spiritual optimism and [[manifest destiny]], would have perceived such a vivid painting of Niagara, with all that it symbolized:

{{quote|Church presented his fellow-men with the "soul" and "spirit" of Niagara, this "most suggestive" of nature's spectacles: this archetype of the universe. ''Niagara'' is the substance of a great American metaphor; indeed, for its original viewers, a certain something more than a metaphor.... Nature and its Bible, the Science of Design, would unfold the transcendent truth of the universe to the New Chosen People in the New World. Nature in the Era of Manifest Destiny was prophecy, and Church as the "interpreter" of Niagara was therefore painting as American prophet.

''Niagara'' is the American's mythical Deluge which washes away the memory of an Old World so that man may live at home in a New World. The painting is an icon of psychic natural purgation and rebirth. Poetically a New World emerges as the waters of a flood subside. The rainbow, sign of the "God of Nature's" covenant with man, transfixes the beholder.... ''Niagara'' is a revelation of the cosmos to each and every man. Before this greatest of American landscapes the self-reliant, democratic American becomes his own prophet: he stands and sees as a New Noah. Thus through the work of art did Mr. Church help his fellow-men to discover themselves in their New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church: Vision of an American Era |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1966 |publisher=George Braziller |lccn=66-16675 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Church studied Niagara Falls extensively leading up to 1857, making dozens of pencil and oil [[study (art)|studies]]. In 1856 Church visited the Falls for probably the fifth time.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt; His teacher [[Thomas Cole]] had also visited the Falls. A writer in ''Art and Artists in Connecticut'' (1879) reported that the painting itself took about six weeks, and that Church used two similar canvases simultaneously: a "draft" upon which he tested a painting idea, and the final canvas, to which he transferred the results he found satisfactory.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt;

==Description==
Church's painting is of [[Horseshoe Falls]], the largest and most iconic of Niagara's three waterfalls. With a width of {{convert|2.3|m}}, it is more than twice as wide as it is high. The canvas's unusual proportions allowed him to paint a panoramic view from the Canadian side of the falls; the composition leads the eye laterally. The vantage point was dramatic and unique, leaving behind the "canonical banality" of many other paintings before it,&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; the merely picturesque, and immersing the viewer directly in the scene, as if airborne or even in the water. The lack of a ''[[repoussoir]]'' aids this effect. Before the advent of modern photography, which made such images common, this was a revelation.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"&gt;Berton, 73–77&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Niagara'' is highly naturalistic, more so than Church's previous ''[[The Andes of Ecuador]]'' (1855), and shows the influence of [[John Ruskin]]'s aesthetics on Church.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt; Church brings the viewer to the lip of the falls, highlighting the impressive drop by painting in streams of water and cloudy mists.&lt;ref name="Revie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Revie, Linda L. |title=The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists, and Writers at the Falls, from Discovery through the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNJ0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |date=2006 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-635-9 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only foreground object is a floating tree trunk, which might be confused for a branch but for its roots, providing a sense of scale. The white foam near the trunk has some build-up of paint on a canvas that is otherwise smooth. The foam might suggest that the tree is caught on an unseen rock; there is ambiguity in whether this location is a small respite of stability or highlights the imminent danger of reaching the fall's edge.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Church's extensive study of the falls allowed him to capture the effect of mist and turbulent water with unprecedented realism. The light creates a partial rainbow beyond the precipice, whose arc is strong where the mist is thick, and absent elsewhere, a highly realistic rendering and a technical achievement.&lt;ref name="rain"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZcCtT1ZeaEC&amp;pg=PA93 |title=The Rainbow Bridge: Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science |last=Lee |first=Raymond L. |last2=Fraser |first2=Alistair B. |date=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0271019778 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distant on the horizon are a number of buildings, including [[Terrapin Point|Terrapin Tower]], on the platform of which stands a tiny person.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting accumulated damage over time, requiring Church to repaint some of it in 1886. He re-worked the sky so that it was more unified with the water, "more subservient to the cataract", but felt limited in the changes he could make by the many copies of the popular ''Niagara'' that existed at that point, in engraving and chromolithography.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and legacy==
Church developed ''Niagara'' with public exhibitions in mind. Between May 1 and 29, 1857, tens of thousands paid 25 cents to view the painting—which was greatly praised by local critics—in a darkened [[Manhattan]] gallery in which only the painting was illuminated.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;Avery, 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Some would spend an hour in front of the painting: "Spectators forgot that they were looking simply at pigment ... The painting became the surrogate of a visit in person to the site."&lt;ref name="hunt"/&gt; Many artists, writers, and politicians reportedly visited the painting's exhibition, including [[Horace Greeley]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], [[George Bancroft]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]],  [[Charles Anderson Dana]], and [[Fitz James O'Brien]].&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1983 |title=Frederic Church's ''Niagara'': Nature and the Nation's Type |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40754705 |journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=100–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand subscriptions to a planned [[chromolithograph]] were sold; $30 for an [[artist's proof]] and $15 for a print, both in color.&lt;ref name="raab38"&gt;Raab, 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harper's'' magazine called ''Niagara'' "more widely known and admired in this country than any other picture ever painted in America".&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  

The painting was shown in England and Scotland in the summer of 1857. After a showing in London, a chromolithograph was made by Day &amp; Son in June, followed by more exhibitions in Glasgow, Manchester, and Liverpool. London's ''[[The Art Journal|Art-Journal]]'' wrote, "No work of its class has ever been more successful: it is truth, obviously and certainly. Considered as a painting, it is a production of rare merit: while admirable as a whole, its parts have been carefully considered and studied; broadly and effectively wrought, yet elaborately finished."&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, 243–246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h73"&gt;Howat, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Famed art critic [[John Ruskin]] was impressed, as reported by Church's friend [[Bayard Taylor]]: "The exhibitor told me that Ruskin had just been to see it, and that he had found effects in it which he had been waiting for years to find." Ruskin was said to have marvelled at the rainbow, believing at first that the play of light through a window was projected onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="rain"/&gt; In September 1858 ''Niagara'' returned to the United States, where, after another New York showing, it travelled to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, and New Orleans.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; ''Cosmopolitan Art Journal'' wrote, "The reputation of this work has greatly increased by its English tour. It is now regarded as the finest painting ever executed by any American artist."&lt;ref name="h73"/&gt; Another exhibition in New York followed. ''Niagara'' was exhibited at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, where it won a silver medal&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; and improved the European view of American art. ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote, "The European critics declared that the 'Niagara' gave them an entirely new and higher view both of American nature and art.&lt;ref name="rodriguez"&gt;Rodriguez Roque, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Study for "Under Niagara" Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumb|This study for ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is similar  in composition to the lithograph of the lost painting.]]

Church's composition was the first painting from the [[Hudson River School]] to be an "instant success".&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt; It was uniquely realistic and "without 'manner'", marking the beginning of a new era for Hudson River artists,&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt;  such as [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], and [[Régis François Gignoux]].&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Heade especially took to ''Niagara'', which may have influenced some of his choices in canvas size. He wrote, "Church's picture ... far exceeds my expectations; &amp; I don't wonder that Ruskin, after looking at it for half an hour, could only utter 'marvelous'. I look upon it as the most wonderful picture I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade: A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonné |last=Stebbins |first=Theodore E. |last2=Comey |first2=Janet L. |last3=Heade |first3=Martin Johnson |last4=Quinn |first4=Karen E. |date=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300081839 |pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Niagara'' was sold to the New York art dealers and print sellers Williams, Stevens &amp; Williams—where it was first exhibited—for US$4,500 in 1857, including $2,000 for reproduction rights.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;  It was acquired at auction in 1861 by the businessman [[John Taylor Johnston]] for US$5,000, and then bought at auction in 1876 by [[William Wilson Corcoran]] for his [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Gallery]] for $12,500, then a record for a painting by an American artist.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt; When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was transferred to the [[National Gallery of Art]], also in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Church made two more finished paintings of the Falls. ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is now lost, but survives in lithographs, including an overpainted lithograph at Olana. It was a 4-by-6 foot painting said to be completed in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The third painting, ''[[Niagara Falls, from the American Side]]'', was made in 1867 and is the largest of Church's paintings by surface area.

'''The Orange Tree Theatre''' is a 180-seat theatre at 1 Clarence Street, [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in south-west London,  which was built specifically as a [[theatre in the round]].&lt;ref name="Visit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visitrichmond.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=13&amp;venue=3500585 | title=Orange Tree Theatre | publisher=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] | work=VisitRichmond | accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed within a disused 1867 primary school, built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic style]].

The theatre was founded in 1971 by its previous [[artistic director]], [[Sam Walters]], and his actress wife [[Auriol Smith]] in a small room above the Orange Tree pub opposite the present building, which opened in 1991.&lt;ref name="Richmond's Theatres"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_theatres.pdf | title=Richmond's Theatres | publisher=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] | work=Local History Notes | accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Miller (theatre director)|Paul Miller]], previously associate director at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], is the artistic director. He succeeded  Walters, the UK's longest-serving theatre director, who retired from the Orange Tree Theatre in June 2014.&lt;ref name="Appointed"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25049609 | title=Orange Tree appoints Paul Miller as artistic director | work=[[BBC News]] | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orange Tree Theatre specialises in staging new plays and rediscovering classics. It has an education and participation programme that reaches over 10,000 people every year.

Since 2014 the theatre has won ten Offies (Off West End Awards), five UK Theatre Awards and the Alfred Fagon Audience Award. It won the Empty Space Peter Brook Award in 2006 and 2015.

==The first Orange Tree Theatre==
As a company the Orange Tree Theatre, then known as the Richmond Fringe, was founded on 31 December 1971 by Sam Walters and Auriol Smith in a small room above [http://www.orangetreerichmond.co.uk The Orange Tree pub],&lt;ref name="Richmond's Theatres" /&gt; close to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond railway station]].

Six former [[pew|church pews]], arranged around the performing area, were used to seat an audience of up to 80 in number.

Initially productions were staged in daylight and at lunchtimes. But when theatre lighting and window-blinds were installed, matinee and evening performances of full-length plays also became possible. The London critics regularly reviewed its productions and the venue gained a reputation for quality and innovation, with theatregoers queuing on the stairs, waiting to purchase tickets.

==The new Orange Tree Theatre==
[[File:Orange Tree Theatre, Kew Road, Richmond. - geograph.org.uk - 46374.jpg|thumb|The new theatre and the 2003 extension]]
As audience numbers increased there was pressure to find a more accommodating space, both front and backstage. On 14 February 1991, the company opened its first production across the road in the current premises, the new Orange Tree Theatre. The theatre is housed within a converted primary school, St John's, which had been built in 1867 and had become derelict; the school was in [[Victorian Gothic]] style and the architect is likely to have been [[Arthur Blomfield]].&lt;ref name="Cherry and Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Buildings of England]]&amp;nbsp;– London 2: South | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | author=[[Bridget Cherry]] and [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] | year=1983 | location=London | page=528 | isbn=0-14-0710-47-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the original theatre, renamed The Room (above the pub), continued to function as a second stage for shorter runs and works in translation until 1997.

===Design and conversion===

The school conversion and construction design were undertaken by Iain Mackintosh as head of the Theatre Projects Consultants team. The design intent was to retain the same sense of intimacy as the old theatre, thus calling for an unusually small acting area.&lt;ref name="Mulryne &amp; Shewring"&gt;{{cite book | title=Making Space for Theatre | publisher=Mulryne &amp; Shewring Ltd | author=Ronnie Mulryne and Margaret Shewring | year=1995 | location=[[Stratford on Avon]] | isbn= 978-1900065009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution was to create, at stage level, no more than three rows of shallow raked seating on any side of the acting area, plus an irregular, timber-clad gallery above of only one row (which helps to "paper the wall with people") under which actors could circulate on two sides to reach the stage entrances at all four corners of the playing space. Foyers and dressing rooms were sited in the rebuilt house of the former headmaster, while the theatre space itself is built where once were the assembly hall and school playground.

Any fears that the special atmosphere of the old theatre would be lost proved unfounded, and close links were formed with the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], also founded as an in-the-round theatre by Sir [[Alan Ayckbourn]].

£750,000 was raised by an appeal, launched in 1988 by Richmond residents [[Richard Attenborough|Sir Richard]] and [[Sheila Sim|Lady Attenborough]].

===2003 extension===
In 2003 the former [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] building next door to the new theatre was modified and re-opened as a dedicated space for rehearsals, set-building and costume storage, significantly expanding and improving its operation.&lt;ref name="Dowden"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/2702/ | title=Sam Walters | work=Exeunt Magazine | date=21 September 2011 | accessdate=5 September 2014 | author=Neil Dowden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Council funding===

In July 2014, [[Arts Council England]] removed the theatre from its list of National Portfolio Organisations for 2015–2018 which means the theatre has to bridge the funding gap with that from external sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Miller reacts to loss of Arts Council NPO funding for the Orange Tree|publisher= Orange Tree Theatre|url=http://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/news/01-07-14/paul-miller-reacts-to-loss-arts-council-npo-funding-for-the-orange-tree|author= Ben Clare|date= 1 July 2014|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Arts Council England announced that it would be awarding £75,000 to the Orange Tree Theatre over the next three years as part of the Catalyst: Evolve fund which matches fundraised income.&lt;ref name="£75,000"&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/about/news/orange-tree-theatre-awarded-75000-in-arts-council-england-funding-over-3-years | title=Orange Tree Theatre awarded £75,000 in Arts Council England funding over 3 years | publisher=Orange Tree Theatre | date=27 July 2016 | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertory==
As well as producing the first six plays by [[Martin Crimp]], plays by [[Susan Glaspell]] and developing a reputation for theatrical rediscoveries, the Orange Tree repertory has also included many special seasons for the work of [[James Saunders (playwright)|James Saunders]], [[Michel Vinaver]], [[Rodney Ackland]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Harley Granville Barker]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] and his contemporaries, including [[John Galsworthy]]. In Paul Miller's first season he presented revivals of plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[DH Lawrence]] and [[Doris Lessing]] as well as premiering plays by [[Alistair McDowall]], [[Deborah Bruce]] and [[Alice Birch]].

The '''Oregon Historic District''' is a neighborhood in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The Oregon District includes one of the earliest surviving combinations of commercial and residential architecture in Dayton. Examples of Dayton's architectural history from 1820 to 1915 line the brick streets and lanes in this 12 square block area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs4LAJdUqlUC&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22anderson%20ferry%22&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anderson%20ferry%22&amp;f=false | title=Shifra Stein's Day Trips from Cincinnati: Getaways Less Than Two Hours Away | publisher=Globe Pequot | date=Oct 1, 2003 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | author=Hunter, David | pages=45| isbn=9780762727490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Styles range from Federal to Queen Anne. Excellent examples of late Victorian commercial and residential architecture illustrate both the entrepreneurial success and the increasing affluence of many Oregon merchants and residents. The district is populated with [[art galleries]], [[specialty shops]], [[pubs]], [[nightclubs]], and [[coffee houses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonartsdistrict.com/|title=Oregon Arts District|accessdate=2009-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410024545/http://www.oregonartsdistrict.com/|archivedate=10 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy description==
The puppies were a variety of plush stuffed dog dolls with floppy ears and droopy eyes. They came in a variety of colors (gray, brown, white), some with spots. Each one came in a cardboard case shaped like a [[doghouse]] with an "adoption" certificate.&lt;ref name=Tubulartoys /&gt; The tagline was "Loveable Huggable". Smaller versions were also created (approximately 5 inches (13&amp;nbsp;cm) long), and a line of cats called '''Pound Pur-r-ries''' was also released. Each authentic toy puppy had a heart-shaped or a bone (on the very first edition puppies) emblem near its tail that sported a "PP" logo with either a dog (Puppies) or cat (Purries) peeking above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-21/news/vw-10463_1_bear-talk/2 |title=Buyers Have an Early Adventure in Toyland : Industry Show Previews Talking Teddy Bears, Cuddly Dolls, More Rambos - Page 2 - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1986-02-21 |accessdate=2013-11-28 |first=John |last=Dreyfuss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy history==
[[File:Child with Pound Puppies toy.png|thumb|right|A child holds up a Pound Puppies toy]]
The toys were created by Mike Bowling in 1984.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; The first puppies were sold by [[Irwin Toy]] in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name=Tubulartoys /&gt; After Irwin, the line was produced by [[Tonka]] which introduced them to the US market.

In 1987, [[Hardee's]] restaurants also offered a series of Pound Puppies with their Children's Meals. Other products besides stuffed toys were made such as [[Little Golden Books]], coloring books and miniature figurines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/poundpuppies-tonka-other.htm Toy photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound Puppies continued to be popular in the early 1990s. The toys were produced again in the early 2000s and included specific breeds of dog (as opposed to a generic model) along with barking sounds and movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012401/nen_5196452.shtml |title=Pound Puppies to be back in stores again |publisher=Florida Times-Union |date=January 24, 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toyline was discontinued in 2002; however, the 2010 series of the same name was produced by Hasbro Studios and aired on The Hub in 2010.

The toyline was relaunched in 2014 by Funrise and they are still available in stores today.

==TV special==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{main|Pound Puppies (TV special)}}

A TV special based on the toyline was released in October 1985 by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. It ran in syndication, paired with ''[[Star Fairies]]''. In the special, a female dog named Violet Vanderfeller is dognapped and ends up at the city pound. The pound puppies attempt to and end up succeeding in reuniting Violet with her family. The special was released in 1986 on [[VHS]] by [[Family Home Entertainment]] and is also available on DVD. The DVD comes with certain Pound Puppies toys.

==TV series==

===1986 TV series===
{{main|Pound Puppies (1986 TV series)}}

After the TV special became successful, [[Hanna-Barbera]] gained the rights to create an animated TV series. The series was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 1986 to February 1989. While the series was loosely based on the special, it made no mention of the character Violet. When it was renewed for a second season, there were major style differences and the series was retitled ''All New Pound Puppies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CHARLES SOLOMON |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-09/entertainment/ca-8568_1_cartoon-series |title=Kidvid Reviews : Cartoon Debuts Are All Drawn Out – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com/2 |date=1987-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another television series, this time produced for [[Hasbro Studios]], was premiered on the Hub Network (now [[Discovery Family]]; partly owned by Hasbro since its launch) on 10 October 2010, the channel's launch date. The characters are based on the current version of the Puppies which Hasbro released in the summer of 2012. In addition, there was an online website where one could download a Pound Puppies adoption certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pound Puppies on TV.com, forum discussion "Toys" |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/pound-puppies/forums/toys-108544-3358884/|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2012, ''Pound Puppies'' was one of four original animated series from The Hub to win the [[CINE|CINE Golden Eagle Award]] for its high quality production and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HubWorld.com press release|url=http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112156/http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the season one episode "I Never Barked for My Father" was awarded the [[Humanitas Prize]] for excellence in writing for children's television animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE HUB TV NETWORK ORIGINAL SERIES ‘POUND PUPPIES,’ FROM HASBRO STUDIOS, HONORED WITH HUMANITAS PRIZE|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/08/08/the-hub-tv-network-original-series-pound-puppies-from-hasbro-studios-honored-with-humanitas-prize/144309/|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feature film==
{{main|Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw}}
In [[1988 in film|1988]], [[TriStar Pictures]] released a Pound Puppies movie titled ''[[Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw]]''. It was produced by [[Atlantic Releasing]], [[Carolco]], [[Family Home Entertainment]] and [[The Kushner-Locke Company|Kushner-Locke]] with [[Michael Maltese|The Maltese Companies]].

===Critical and box office reception===

The film was panned by critics, and poorly received at the box office. Shoddy animation, character inconsistencies, and a color palette that differed from the show's were among the chief complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Solomon |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-26/entertainment/ca-25_1_pound-puppies |title=MOVIE REVIEWS : Producers Should Curb These Dog Cartoons – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1988-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was also not part of the show's continuity.

Fans were also confused by the apparent romantic pairing of Nose Marie and Cooler, which contradicted events that had taken place in the first season of the series.  In addition, the movie is set in the 1950s with the story being narrated by Whopper, who in the present day is now an older dog who tells the story to his nephew and niece.

'''Regina Olson Hughes''' (1895-1993) was an American scientific illustrator in [[Botanical illustration|Botanical Art]]. Born February 1, 1895 in [[Herman, Nebraska]], she became fascinated with the world of plants and flowers. Her parents were Johana and Gilbert Hughes. At age 10, she contracted [[scarlet fever]] and slowly decreased her hearing until she became fully deaf at age 14. In order for her to communicate with her peers, she relied on [[lip reading]] and written notes for business work. Hughes retained her speech skills and continued to speak fluently throughout her adulthood. She became proficient in sign language when she enrolled in Gallaudet College.

She loved her rural home, rampant with weeds, plants and flowers. An interest in art also dominated her childhood. Her parents provided art tutoring. [[Plant]]s and [[flower]]s were her favorite subjects. In 1923, Hughes married Frederick H. Hughes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and lived on Gallaudet University's campus for thirty years. He was Gallaudet’s legendary [[Deaf culture|Deaf]] economics professor, theater enthusiast, and football coach. In 1956, he died of a heart attack. She died August 12, 1993 due to heart failure at age 98.

== Education ==
Hughes attended [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]], the then only postsecondary program for deaf students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Persons in the Arts and Sciences|last = Lang|first = Harry|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = |isbn = |location = Westport, Connecticut|pages = 188–191|last2 = Meath-Lang|first2 = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said, “In 1918, when I graduated from Gallaudet, deaf people were looked down upon. We were treated like children.” But she never backed down from a challenge. At Gallaudet she proved her gift as a writer and poet, contributing many poems to the college's newspaper, ''Buff and Blue''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Artists in America: Colonical to Contemporary|last = Sonnenstrahl|first = Deborah M.|publisher = Dawn Sign Press|year = |isbn = |location = San Diego, California|pages = Page 150–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she graduated, she called on [[Nebraska]] senator Filbert Hichcock, founder of [[Omaha World-Herald|Omaha World Herald]] and friend of her father, and asked if he could help her find a political job. He told her, “nice girls don’t work. You go home and stay with your papa and meet a nice man and he'll take care of you.” She was notably unimpressed with this advice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Great Deaf Americans: The Second Edition|last = Moore|first = Matthew|publisher = Deaf Life Press|year = |isbn = |location = Rochester, NY|pages = 118–124|last2 = Panara|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her bachelor’s in art in 1918 and her master's degree in 1920.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Government work ==
After graduation, Hughes worked at the [[Veterans Administration]] for a few weeks before moving on to the state department.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1930, Hughes worked at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] as a research clerk then as a [[scientific illustrator]] and [[Translation|translator]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She attained stature as an artist and scholar during years of government service. She used her fluency in four languages- [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]- to work as a translator in the State department during World War I.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America|last = Gannon|first = Jack R.|publisher = Gallaudet University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the departments of war and commerce where her most prestigious assignment was translating during the Conference on limitation of armament in Washington, after the armistice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She   served as a translator for the [[United States Department of State|US department of State]], one of only two non-French women employed by the US office of Translation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1936, she became the scientific illustrator in botany for the [[Agricultural Research Service]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hughes’ experiences has included years of honored illustration work for the Agricultural Research Service and the US Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then in 1969, she “retired” from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] but then continued work for the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She continued to work until the day she died in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other work ===
Hughes worked at the Smithsonian until 1990 but did side work as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She taught at the [[Mississippi School for the Deaf|Mississippi school for the deaf]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She painted [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]] for  Robert W. Read, [[Curator]] in the Smithsonian Department of Botany, and continuing as a contract illustrator for scientists at both the USDA and the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Robert Reed was very impressed by her work and continued to work together for 17 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She has also been a resident illustrator in the Department of Botany at the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her interest in art and language generated thick sketchbooks. Most of her paintings, as well as many flower studies are based on sketches made during her travels throughout much of the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1979 the Smithsonian Institution honored her by naming a new species, of [[Bromeliad]], "''Billbergia reginae''," for Regina Olson Hughes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the only person to have both a plant genus and species named for her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1981, Robert M. King and Harold Robinson, named a member of the [[Asteraceae]] after her "[[Hughesia|''Hughesia reginae'']]."

== Illustrations ==
Hughes was a botanical artist and focused on plants, particularly orchids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her illustrations include a variety of skills such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], oils, [[gouache]] and pencil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To be an effective botanical illustrator, one has to be intelligent, patient, knowledgeable, aesthetic and naturally artistic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Art history books, generally, do not include scientific illustration, which has been long considered more technical, utilitarian, or even distinguished craftsmanship rather than a means of artistic self-expression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The necessity of executing accurate images of natural plans and flowers requires explicit replication of the object, thus eliminating personal input by the illustrator.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was known for her beautiful, precise and intricate depictions of weeds, orchids, and exotic species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her lived combination of arts and sciences emanated from her passion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much of her work is so detailed that it has been done with the aid of a [[microscope]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hughes was primarily self-educated [[botany]], working closely with [[taxonomists]] and other scientists as she illustrated the flowers, weeds, plants, and seeds they collected and categorized from all over the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For all of these illustrations she wrote the plant descriptions&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silence of the Spheres: The Deaf Experience in the History of Science|last = Lang|first = Harry G.|publisher = Bergin &amp; Garvey|year = |isbn = |location = Westport, Connecticut|pages = Pages 101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no backgrounds to distract the scientists from the main subject of the work. Colors are held to a minimum to avoid interference with the subject. Similar parts of the plant might be shown in different levels of details. Distortotion is frequently seen in Hughes' works in order to show the important parts. Plants and flowers parts must show exact proportions in a corresponding scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Published work and art shows ===
She was the first [[Hearing loss|deaf]] artist to have a solo show at the Smithsonian; 40 meticulous watercolors of orchids were exhibited in the Rotunda Gallery of the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History]] in 1982: “Artist and Botanist-A Collaboration.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited with the National League of American Pen Women, the Guild of Natural science illustrators, and the hunt institute for Botanical Documentation at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie-Mellon University]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Agricultural Research Service Handbook 366, which contains 224 full-page plates of her work and has been published&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; under the title "Common Weeds of the US," by [[Dover Publications|Dover Press]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The USDA Handbook N0. 498,"Economically Important Foreign Weeds, Potential Problems in the United States," contains over 6,000 of her drawings of seeds and plants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her orchid paintings are permanently on public view at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Museum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Santa María de Melque''' is a church in the border municipality of San Martín de Montalbán in the province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] (in [[Spain]]), 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the capital, and equidistant from the towns of [[La Puebla de Montalbán]] and Gálvez, between the brook Ripas and the river Torcón, a tributary of the river [[Tagus]].

Of the entire complex, recently restored, the church stands out, exemplary [[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]]-[[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]], as the most important religious monument of the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Spain.

Currently, the church, which occupies the center of the complex, and the center of interpretation which has been installed in the adjoining rooms, also restored, can be visited. The scenery that is observed from '''Santa María''' is also characteristic of the area.

==History==
[[File:Santa María de Melque (Toledo) 01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Inside of the church.]]

'''Santa María de Melque''' came into being as a monastic collection in the 7th and 8th centuries inside of what was the capital of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Construction commenced in the 7th century, coinciding with the end of the Visigothic kingdom, and probably came to a halt with the arrival of the Arabs, to be continued later.

There was originally a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement on that location, with five dams across the two brooks that surround the small, rocky hill. Next the monastery was built with the buildings organized around the church.

The Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula did not immediately end with this monastic nucleus, because there are testimonies of the survival of a Mozarabic community that later disappeared. Its constructions were used as urban nucleus and its church was fortified with the construction of a tower on the dome of the church, tower that is still preserved. Water from rain and from the gullys was detained by means of dams placed both sides of the complex.

With the conquest of Toledo by King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] in 1085, the temple recovered its liturgical function without losing its military function. The anthropomorphic tombs located to the east and the remains of barbicans that remain are testimonies of this historic period.

==Architecture==
[[File:Planta SMdM.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plan of the church.]]

It was constructed in 8th century and it's the first one-half monument better preserved of the Spanish [[High Middle Ages]]. Its constructive technique is the architecture's direct inheritance late roman.
However, the lack of decorative elements preserved (filigrees of stucco in the transverse arches of the crossing) that still can be seen in the background of the southern arm of the crossing suggests that Melque could be at first a mausoleum, destined to burial of a distinguished personage from Toledo's [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. The church was later redesigned on at least two occasions.

The [[Knights Templar]] turned the church into defensive tower, like a ''turris'' as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used to. This tower over the dome base has been recently dismounted. It had a porch with three openings which no longer exists.

The plant is cruciform, with a central apse: the two lateral apses were added later. It keeps in good condition its different naves, some side chapels and a parlor with very pronounced horseshoe arches. And a niche probably for the founder of the temple.

The presbytery is large correspondingly to a monastic community with Round arches at both sides. Also is preserved a moorish tower over the vault.

It was made with enormous unmortared blocks which look like the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]]. The molduration is calculated in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], similar to the [[San Pedro of Arisgotas]] molduration, also in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

This church has contributions of clearly Visigothic style with new solutions that the mozarabs contribute, and besides memories of the Roman style:
* '''Visigothic contributions''': the horseshoe arch that supports the apse's vault, surpassing 1/3 of the radium. The set unprovided of remains sculptured, of Visigothic tradition. The [[arcosolium]].
* '''Mozarabic contributions''': central horseshoe arches of surpassing 1/2 of the radium. Arches of the windows in 2/3. Strange semicircular pilasters of the inside that neither may be considered semi-detached.
* '''Innovations''': the circular reduction of the corners in its 4 facades and the vertical crack at both sides, having the appearance of pseudo columns. It looks like the columns placed at the corners of the lantern towers of Romanesque Norman style. It's an unprecedented solution.
* '''Roman style''': The enormous granite blocks, the molduration in [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman cubits]], its plant is comparable to [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in [[Ravenna]] ([[Italy]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28913">The '''Symphony No. 2''' by the [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Witold Lutosławski]] is an [[orchestra]]l composition in two [[movement (music)|movements]] written between 1965 and 1967.  The work exhibits Lutosławski's technique of "limited aleatoricism", where the individual instrumental parts are notated exactly, but their precise co-ordination is organised using controlled elements of chance.

==Personal and musical transitions==
Lutosławski wrote his Symphony No. 2 between 1965 and 1967. The preceding years had been a time of transition for him and for [[Poland]]. The [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] had seized control of the country in the aftermath of [[World War II]], and the iron-fisted cultural dictation of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist]] government severely limited both the output of Polish composers and their exposure to musical developments in the outside world between the 1949 and 1954. Many pieces, including Lutosławski's [[Symphony No. 1 (Lutosławski)|first symphony]], were condemned as [[Formalism (music)|formalist]] (focused on esoteric considerations of [[Musical form|form]] rather than on speaking directly to the [[proletariat]]) and banned from public performance.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 35–6 and 60–1&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956 the Poles took advantage of Stalin's death to reform their government. The national ruling communist ideology became more liberal, especially regarding the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing this shift, the first [[Warsaw Autumn]] (Poland's international [[music festival]]) took place in 1957.  The purpose of this festival was to expose Polish audiences to new music which had been prohibited by the communist regime and promote the work of modern Polish composers.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;   Lutosławski's work ''Muzyka żałobna'' ("Music of Mourning" sometimes translated "Funeral Music") was featured in the 1958 festival.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;   In the decade that followed, Lutosławski's reputation flourished both in Poland and abroad; he traveled to many European and American music centers to serve as a [[music critic]] at music festivals, hear his works performed and receive various awards.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 64, 78, and 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The second symphony marked a culmination of Lutosławski's music to that point. The years between the end of [[World War II]] and its completion had been a continuous effort to cement his personal style.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutosławski had completed his first symphony in 1947—a work that some have called [[neoclassicist]] in its extensive use of [[Canon (music)|canon]] and adherence to the [[Symphony#History of the form|4-movement standard]] and [[sonata form]] in the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost two decades separate the first and second symphonies, and musically, they are a world apart. In the process of composing ''Five Songs on texts of Kazimiera Iłłakowicz'' (1956–1958), ''Muzyka żałobna'' (1958), ''Three Postludes'' (1959–1964), and ''Jeux vénitiens'' (1960–1), he developed the [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[rhythm]]ic elements that define the ''Symphony No. 2'' and other mature works. The second movement of the symphony, "Direct", even used some material that had been sketched and abandoned for a fourth postlude.&lt;ref name="Stucky 1981, p. 79"&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

These hallmarks of Lutosławski's new style include harmonic [[tone row#total chromatic|aggregate]] chords using all twelve tones, macrorhythmic ''accelerando'', texture as a formal element, and a preference for grouping instruments with similar colors.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 65, 70, 82, and 128&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lutosławski heard [[John Cage]]'s [[piano concerto]], he began exploring limited [[aleatoricism]], and this became a feature of his style, although he intentionally never extended his employment of chance techniques beyond rhythm. Lutosławski stated that this rhythmic technique allows the performer a more interpretive role while preserving the control of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Harmonic color preoccupied him; it was one way he tied himself to previous composers like [[Debussy]].&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  For Lutosławski, color was a vertical phenomenon in music, created both by the instruments used together and the [[interval (music)|intervals]] their parts created.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1968), pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutosławski proceeded on the momentum of the ''Symphony No. 2'' to write the ''Livre pour orchestre'' (1968), crystallizing his personal style even further.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission and early performances==
By the early 1960s, Lutosławski had so many offers for commissions that he accepted only those that aligned with his current compositional goals.  ''Symphony No. 2'' developed out of a commission from the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] in [[Hamburg]] to commemorate the 100th concert in their series of new musical works.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;   Unfortunately, the entire symphony was not completed in time for the concert in Hamburg, so only the second movement, ''Direct'', was performed by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk with [[Pierre Boulez]] conducting, on October 18, 1966.&lt;ref name="luto149"&gt;Lutosławski (2007), p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;   The performance was met with great excitement and appreciation by all in attendance at the concert.&lt;ref name="luto149" /&gt;   Although the reception was positive, Lutosławski was disappointed by the partial nature of the premiered.&lt;ref name="luto149" /&gt;   Less than a year later, on June 9, 1967, Symphony No. 2 (both ''Hesitant'' and ''Direct'') was premiered by the Polish Radio Orchestra with Lutosławski conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;   The next performance took place that year at the Warsaw Autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The second symphony is the first large-scale work for orchestra to use Lutosławski's new conception of two-movement form.&lt;ref name="nik95"/&gt;   After its success he began to refine this technique for use in future works.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (1996), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;   Lutosławski believed that form should be a vital but simple part of composition, "even...describable in one sentence."&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1968), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In his conception of two-movement form, the first movement is "preparatory, introductory in character"; its musical thoughts remain "unsaid", and the movement as a whole sounds [[aphoristic]].&lt;ref name="nik95"&gt;Nikolska (1994), pp. 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;  The second movement then carries the bulk of the symphony's aesthetic weight; it is the "occurrence" that the first movement prepares.  Lutosławski connects this feeling of proportion, especially in the presence of only one emotionally and semantically complex movement, to the symphonies of eighteenth-century [[Vienna]] and [[Haydn]] in particular.&lt;ref name="nik95"/&gt;  The second symphony only has one true point of climax—in the second movement—which goes against the symphonic principle of [[Beethoven]] and others that distribute the 'weight' of their symphonies more evenly.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the style of earlier Western music, his work demonstrates closed form. Closed form compositions are intended to lead the listener down a specific path, both melodically and harmonically.  A simple example of a melodic trait of closed form is the use and [[fragmentation (music)|fragmentation]] of [[Motif (music)|motives]]; a harmonic example is the use of [[chord progression|progressions]] to lure the listener to expect something, such as a climax or an ending.&lt;ref&gt;Lutosławski (2007), pp. 133–5&lt;/ref&gt;  The symphony demonstrates on a large scale the importance of motion towards a musical goal—the sort of tension and release that is a foundational principle of Western music.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second symphony, these ideas manifest in the following way.  The first movement, ''Hésitant'', is a series of six episodes, building in intensity throughout the movement.  According to Lutosławski,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All the episodes unfold in the same way: a short [[phrase (music)|phrase]] emerges tentatively and then subsides for a brief moment.  Only then does the true beginning of every episode follow.   None of the episodes has an actual ending.  The growing boldness and mounting momentum of the musical action is followed by a pause, as if the energy had been spent.  Then a few tentative attempts are made to take up the episode again.  All the attempts are in vain and the theme is abandoned.&lt;ref name="luto140"&gt;Lutosławski (2007), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Each of the episodes is followed by a refrain played by the [[double reed]] instruments.&lt;ref name="luto140" /&gt;  The dynamic tempos and varied colors of the episodes alternate with the static refrains.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1968), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   The first movement could be summarized as a series of interrupted passages that push toward a climax that never materializes.

The second movement, ''Direct'', begins while "the last phrase of the first movement still echoes."&lt;ref name="luto140" /&gt;  Lutosławski again offers a cogent explanation of the movement's shape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The second movement, unlike the first, unfolds continuously without any pauses.  Individual musical ideas overlap one another frequently, creating uninterrupted discourse.  This [[musical development|development]] heads straight for the final solution without any digressions.  That is why this movement is called Direct.&lt;ref name="luto141"&gt;Lutosławski (2007), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Lutosławski, this second movement subdivides into a series of five overlapping "evolutionary stages".&lt;ref  name="luto141" /&gt;   Demarcating the first three of these stages is very difficult, but the fourth and fifth stages are more obvious.  The fourth stage begins at downbeat 133 and ends just before downbeat 151; the fifth and final stage begins at downbeat 151 and ends after downbeat 160.  Across these five stages, one may observe two significant rhythmic processes: a process of unification from ''ad libitum'' playing to metered playing and a process of acceleration from longer sections with sustained material to shorter sections in faster tempos with quicker rhythmic material, producing rhythmic acceleration on two levels, that of ''microrhythm'', the surface rhythms within sections, and on the level of ''macrorhythm'', the lengths of sections.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of the separation of microrhythm and macrorhythm may be found in Nikolska (1994), p. 77; more detailed discussion of these rhythmic processes can be found in both Rae (1994), p. 106 and Nikolska (1994), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;   This process pushes to the climax of the movement and the symphony as a whole, which occurs
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the simple rhythm, which has been achieved gradually over a considerable period, is transformed suddenly into an extremely complex rhythmical structure when the whole orchestra begins to play ''[[ad libitum]]''.  It is as if a building which has been painstakingly put together over a long time suddenly shatters into thousands of fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1984), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harmonically, the climax of this piece is marked by a twelve-tone chord based on 5ths and 6ths that falls away and almost immediately makes another effort. This too is ultimately unsuccessful, and softer and softer chords lead to the end of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the two movements are shockingly different on the surface, their overall shape is remarkably similar.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1968), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  Both movements fail to reach a definitive climax.  The first movement's climax never arrives, and the second movement's climactic chords collapse into fitful murmuring.

Given the work's highly individual form and its clear detachment from [[symphony#History of the symphony|eighteenth-]] and [[symphony#History of the symphony|nineteenth-century]] conceptions of the symphony, what makes this a symphony?  Lutosławski lists several criteria for a symphony: it must be a large-scale piece – "A ten-minute piece of music shall not be referred to as a symphony"; it must be a closed form, thus excluding much music based on Cage's aesthetic; it must be written for the symphonic orchestra; and most importantly, "it must be properly shaped into a process with a perceptible ''akcja'' (i.e., action).  By 'action' I understand a purely musical 'plot'...a chain of interrelated musical events."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolska (1994), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical approaches==

===''Akcja''===

Although [[Lutosławski]] has emphasized the importance of ''akcja'' to his music, a clear understanding of the concept has yet to coalesce.  Most theories return to an analytical approach to musical characters developed by Lutosławski's mentor, [[Witold Maliszewski]]. Maliszewski's system of four characters classifies musical passages as either narrative, transitional, introductory, or concluding.&lt;ref&gt;Reyland (2007), p. 610&lt;/ref&gt;   Nicholas Reyland suggests that these four classifications can be generalized further for Lutosławski's music into two categories: static and dynamic.&lt;ref name="reyland613"&gt;Reyland (2007), p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;   Static, or narrative, passages are characterized by sustained harmonies, distinctive motivic ideas, and a lack of obvious goal-direction;&lt;ref  name="reyland613" /&gt;  the entry of a new narrative passage is "like the entry of a new character in a drama."&lt;ref&gt;Reyland (2007), p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;   Narrative passages in Lutosławski's form thus establish musical content, characters, and the "key ideas" – Lutosławski's twentieth-century transformation of the concept of [[motif (music)|motif]], which he loosely defines as consisting of "a small number of notes."&lt;ref&gt;Reyland (2007), p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;   Dynamic passages, then, are characterized by changing harmonies, evolving or repeated motivic ideas, shifting [[dynamics (music)|dynamic]] levels, and clear goal-direction.&lt;ref name="reyland613" /&gt;   ''Akcja'' then, in Reyland's view, consists of the interaction, evolution, and transformation of key ideas throughout a musical work.&lt;ref&gt;Reyland (2007), p. 618&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Bodman Rae observes a long-range relationship between the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] classes E-flat and F, heard as a major second at the very beginning of the first movement and as a major ninth at the end of the second movement.  He proposes that this latter passage (downbeat 158) functions as a culmination of the entire [[symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Rae (1994), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;   A full analysis of this symphony in terms of ''akcja'' would trace the development of this and other key ideas (perhaps the first movement's [[refrain]]) throughout the work.

Though the titles of the two movements are somewhat indicative, Lutosławski refused to discuss their meaning except in vague terms. In an interview about the symphony with Tadeusz Kaczyński in 1967, he stated that "[[music]] is not meant to express anything in an unambiguous manner" and therefore a concrete meaning of the piece "would not have much sense."&lt;ref&gt;Kaczyński (1968), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Register and texture-space===

Michael Klein proposes that the perception of long-range formal trajectories in [[Lutosławski]]'s music of the 1960s and 1970s may be enhanced by the analysis of transformations on [[register (music)|register]], or [[texture (music)|texture]]-space.  Klein defines three transformations on register — contraction, expansion, and projection&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1999), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  — in addition to properties of texture such as field (register from lowest to highest note), density (number of voices or number of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] in the textural field, depending on context), and compression (how tightly packed the voices are, computed by dividing density by field) to describe the texture in a particular passage.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1999), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;   Contraction is defined as the movement inward of one or both of the registral extremes from one passage to another; expansion, then is the movement outward of one or both registral extremes; and projection is a shift in register, i.e. both registral extremes move in the same direction, though not necessarily by the same amount.

===Limited aleatoricism===

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Luto.jpg|thumb|450px|right|A sample passage from "Direct" showing Lutosławski's limited [[aleatoric]] ''[[ad libitum]]'' technique.]] --&gt;

Concerning the symphony and [[Lutosławski]]'s compositional techniques, Martin Cooper says that "Lutosławski's controlled randomness is a method which leaves players rather more license than most schoolchildren enjoy in class, while giving the conductor the schoolmaster's task of intervening at roughly fixed intervals."&lt;ref&gt;Maciejewski (1976), pp. 36–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Symphony No. 2 utilizes a [[modernism (music)|modernistic]] approach to the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] art of [[counterpoint]], coined by some as "aleatoric counterpoint".&lt;ref&gt;Varga (1976), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;   Nearly all of Symphony No. 2 is written in limited [[aleatoric]] sections called ''ad libitum'' by the composer.  In each of these sections, no [[bar (music)|bar lines]] are marked and each part plays a different length of music.  After a certain point each of the performers repeats a segment of his or her part until the conductor signals the transition to a new section, possibly conducted in the traditional manner, possibly ''ad libitum''.  Only one section of Symphony No. 2 is conducted in the traditional manner, the fourth "evolutionary" stage of the second movement (downbeats 133–50).

Although each of the parts is relatively simple in terms of [[rhythm]] and [[melody]], the composite [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and rhythmic structures in these ''ad libitum'' sections can become complex.  Each performer is instructed to play "with the expressive freedom of a [[solo (music)|solo]] or a [[cadenza]]" – including those playing the same part.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolska (1994) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;   Any vertical alignment on the score after the beginning of such a passage is to be ignored by the instrumentalist or the conductor; instead of being controlled via the [[Sheet music|score]], [[rhythm]] in these sections (''microrhythm'') is contributed to by every individual performer.  [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] structures, on the other hand, are strictly pre-ordained by the composer.  Analysis of individual parts separates the structural tones from the embellishing tones.  The composite constructed of each part's structural tones, in pitch space, is understood as the harmonic complex underpinning the section.  For textural/registral analysis, the properties of this harmony represent texture-space in this passage.  After performing similar analysis on another passage, one may determine the transformation that relates texture in the two passages.

Although these harmonic complexes may contain all twelve chromatic [[pitch class]]es, they tend to feature only a few [[interval class]]es between adjacent pitches.&lt;ref name="rae50"&gt;Rae (1994), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;   Lutosławski has said that the use of more intervals in these harmonies results in sonorities that are "faceless" or that "have no character".&lt;ref name="rae50" /&gt;

''Ad libitum'' passages on the whole have a very particular role in [[Lutosławski]]'s music.  Most often they represent static, narrative passages with one harmonic complex underpinning them,&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1999), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  though some ''ad libitum'' passages migrate from one [[harmonic]] complex to another.&lt;ref&gt;Rae (1994), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;   This makes their study particularly important in terms of ''akcja'', although, given their preponderance in Symphony No. 2, perhaps our understanding of the "narrative" character in Lutosławski's music needs to be further refined.

==Farewell to the symphony==
As Lutosławski's musical career progressed, he began to cement his ideas and beliefs concerning the symphony orchestra, forms, and many other aspects of composition.  He believed that there was no sense in writing music that was so difficult to play that the musicians forgot about the importance of musicality.  Lutosławski stated that "[[Music]] that is easy to play sounds better than difficult music," and then went on to convey his "hope to have some part in helping musicians recapture the sense of pleasure that the playing of music can provide."&lt;ref&gt;Lutosławski, ''The Orchestral [[Composer]]'s Point of View'', 130–1&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerning the use of instruments in contemporary pieces, Lutosławski had many opinions.  He believed that present day instruments were dated and left little to no room for evolution in composition.  He stated that although the instruments in the orchestra ''can'' play non-diatonic music, they are not designed for it, and to do so requires greater effort.  In a similar sense, the string instruments can play music that does not fit in the twelve-tone scale system, but to accomplish that, a new system of playing would have to emerge.  Lutosławski also commented on modified symphony instruments and [[extended technique]], saying that altering the use of these "great works of art" is "unnatural" and "jarring".&lt;ref&gt;Lutosławski, ''The Orchestral [[Composer]]'s Point of View'', 129–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Symphony No. 2 shows his reverence of classical instruments, with little to no use of the instruments outside of the realm of their "natural" performance techniques, but also begins to foreshadow his travels away from the relic we call [[orchestra]]{{Or|date=May 2009}} (although he composed two more symphonies after this one).  Beginning as far back as the ''Three Postludes'' (1959–1964), he began designating pieces "farewell to the orchestra".&lt;ref name="Stucky 1981, p. 79"/&gt;   These ideas led [[Lutosławski]] to look ahead to a time when the orchestra would be replaced by an ensemble that could produce what he already heard in his head.

'''Teaching artists''', also known as '''art teachers''' or '''artist educators''' or '''community artists''', are [[artist|professional artists]] who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, [[After-school activity|after school programs]], community agencies, [[prison]]s, jails, and [[Social services|social service]] agencies. The ''Arts In Education'' movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm History of Teaching Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227120148/http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm |date=2012-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts learning consultant [[Eric Booth]] has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about [[the arts]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124354/http://nysaae.org/docs/The_History_of_Teaching_Artistry_By_Eric_Booth.pdf Booth Article]&lt;/ref&gt; This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm Teaching Artist described] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005527/http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate]], ''Journal of a Living Experiment, a documentary history of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative and the writers-in-the-schools movement.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5994">'''The Folklore Society''' (FLS) is a national association in the United Kingdom for the study of [[folklore]].

It was founded in London in 1878 to study traditional vernacular culture, including traditional music, song, dance and drama, narrative, arts and crafts, customs and belief. The foundation was prompted by a suggestion made by [[Eliza Gutch]] in the pages of ''[[Notes and Queries]]''.&lt;ref name=DEF&gt;[[Jacqueline Simpson]] (Editor), [[Steve Roud]] (Editor) (2003). ''A Dictionary of English Folklore''. [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1074552|THE FOLKLORE SOCIETY}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Members==
[[William Thoms]], the editor of ''Notes and Queries'' who had first introduced the term ''folk-lore'', seems to have been instrumental in the formation of the society, and, along with [[George Laurence Gomme|G. L. Gomme]], was for many years a leading member.&lt;ref name="Roper2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roper |first=Jonathan |year=2007 |title=Thoms and the Unachieved "Folk-Lore of England" |journal=Folklore |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=203–216 |issn=0015-587X |doi=10.1080/00155870701340035 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a780581414&amp;fulltext=713240928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent members were identified as the "great team" in [[Richard Dorson]]'s now long outdated 1967 history of [[English folklore|British folklore]], late-Victorian leaders of the surge of intellectual interest in the field, these were [[Andrew Lang]], [[Edwin Sidney Hartland]], [[Alfred Nutt]], [[William Alexander Clouston]], [[Edward Clodd]] and Gomme. Later historians have taken a deeper interest in the pre-modern views of members such as [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[Joseph Jacobs]]: A Sociological Folklorist" [[Gary Alan Fine]] ''Folklore'' Vol. 98, No. 2 (1987), pp. 183–193 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1259979 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;
A long-serving member and steady contributor to the society's discourse and publications was [[Charlotte Sophia Burne]], the first woman to become editor of its journal and later president (1909–10) of the society.&lt;ref name=Ashman2000&gt;"[[Charlotte Sophia Burne]]: Shropshire Folklorist, First Woman President of the Folklore Society, and First Woman Editor of Folklore. Part 1: A Life and Appreciation",
Gordon Ashman and Gillian Bennett,
''Folklore'',
Vol. 111, No. 1 (Apr., 2000), pp. 1–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The society publishes, in partnership with [[Taylor and Francis]], the journal ''Folklore'' in three issues per year, and since 1986 a newsletter, ''FLS News''.

The journal began as ''The Folk-Lore Record'' in 1878, continued or was restarted as ''The Folk-Lore Journal'', and from 1890 its issues were compiled as volumes entitled "Folk-Lore: A Quarterly Review of Myth, Tradition, Institution, &amp; Custom. Incorporating ''The Archæological Review'' and ''The Folk-Lore Journal''". [[Joseph Jacobs]] edited the first four annual volumes as the Quarterly Review, succeeded by [[Alfred Nutt]]. As the head of David Nutt in the Strand, Alfred Nutt was the publisher from 1890.&lt;ref&gt;

The Folklore Society Library has around 15,000 books and more than 200 serial titles (40 currently received) and is held at [[University College London]] Library. Its major strengths are in folk narrative and British and [[Irish folklore]]; there are also substantial holdings of east [[European folklore]] books, and long runs of [[Estonian folklore|Estonian]] and [[Basque folklore]] serials.

The Folklore Society Archives and Collections include folklore-related papers of G. L. Gomme and [[Lady Gomme]], T. F. Ordish, [[William Crooke]], Henry Underhill, [[Estella Canziani]], George Galloway, Barbara Aitken, [[Margaret Murray]], [[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]] and others. The society's archives and collections are held at [[University College London's Special Collections]].

The Folklore Society office is at [[The Warburg Institute]], where it keeps a small collection of reference books and essential finding aids, including the card catalogue of all FLS library accessions up to 1993 (all FLS accessions after 1993 have been added to University College London Library's online catalogue. Their library is classified according to a modified form of the [[Garside classification]] scheme.&lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonser |first1=Wilfrid |last2=Garside |first2=Kenneth | author2link =Kenneth Garside|year=1955 |title=The Classification of the Library of the Folk-Lore Society |journal=Folklore |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=267–281 |jstor=258268 |doi=10.1080/0015587x.1955.9717469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fountain of Indolence''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the English artist [[J. M. W. Turner]]. First exhibited in 1834, it is now in the collection of the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]] in [[Fredericton]], New Brunswick, Canada.

==Subject==
The painting depicts a scene described in Canto 1 of [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s 1748 poem ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]''.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Sebastian|title=James Thomson's picture collection and British history painting|journal=Journal of the History of Collections|date=2011|volume=23|issue=1|pages=127–151|doi=10.1093/jhc/fhq017|quote=Turner was the most prominent of many nineteenth-century painters to admire Thomson's verse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus easy-rob'd, they to the fountain sped&lt;br /&gt;
That in the middle of the court up-threw&lt;br /&gt;
A stream, high spouting from its liquid bed,&lt;br /&gt;
And falling back again in drizzly dew;&lt;br /&gt;
There each deep draughts, as deep he thirsted drew;&lt;br /&gt;
It was a fountain of [[nepenthe]] rare;&lt;br /&gt;
Whence, as Dan Homer sings, huge pleasaunce grew,&lt;br /&gt;
And sweet oblivion of vile earthly care;&lt;br /&gt;
Fair gladsome waking thoughts, and joyous dreams more fair.&lt;ref name=RPO&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=James|title=The Castle of Indolence Canto 1|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/castle-indolence-canto-i|work=RPO: Representative poetry online|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It shows an imaginary landscape with [[Classical architecture|Classical]] buildings and ruins centred on the fountain, around and within which human and winged [[Cupid]]-like figures are grouped.

==History==
''The Fountain of Indolence'' was first exhibited at the 66th [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] Exhibition at [[Somerset House]] in May 1834, to a generally favourable reception.&lt;ref name=Butlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Butlin|first=Martin|title=The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|author2=Joll, Evelyn |pages=185–186|quote=The critics recognized that it was a work of imagination and thus were willing to allow Turner more license than normal in the use of colours.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts|volume=IV|series=New Series|issue=7|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl0oAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22fountain%20of%20indolence%22&amp;pg=PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent history of the painting is unknown until 1882, when it was sold to [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]] by H. Lumley. [[William Henry Vanderbilt]] then purchased it from Agnew and it remained in the Vanderbilt family until 1958. [[George W. Vanderbilt]] loaned it to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] for an exhibition of British paintings in 1907.&lt;ref name=Zalewski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zalewski|first=Leanne|title=Art for the public: William Henry Vanderbilt's cultural legacy|journal=Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide|date=Summer 2012|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/summer12/leanne-zalewski-william-henry-vanderbilts-cultural-legacy|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] was actively seeking a "first-rate" Turner painting for the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, which was to open the following year in Fredericton. He purchased ''The Fountain of Indolence'' from the dealers Leggatt Brothers of London.&lt;ref name=Poitras&gt;{{cite book|last=Poitras|first=Jacques|title=Beaverbrook: A Shattered Legacy|date=2007|publisher=Goose Lane Editions|location=Fredericton, New Brunswick|isbn=9780864925220}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} The painting became central to a dispute that developed in 2004 between the Gallery and the Beaverbrook UK Foundation, which claimed ownership of 133 paintings that had been acquired by Lord Beaverbrook for the Gallery. The Foundation proposed to take back and sell ''The Fountain of Indolence'', which [[Sotheby's]] had valued in 2002 at between $16.7 and $25&amp;nbsp;million in Canadian funds.&lt;ref name=Poitras /&gt; {{rp|203}}The Gallery denied that the Foundation owned the paintings, maintaining that they all belonged to the Gallery. Both sides agreed to submit to [[arbitration]], which resulted in a 2007 ruling that 85 of the paintings, including ''The Fountain of Indolence'', belonged to the Gallery, while the remaining 48 belonged to the Foundation. The Foundation appealed the ruling, but it was confirmed by an appeal panel in 2009.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Fredericton gallery wins appeal over Beaverbrook collection|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-gallery-wins-appeal-over-beaverbrook-collection-1.861680|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=CBC News New Brunswick|date=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Fountain of Fallacy''==

The gap in the [[provenance]] of ''The Fountain of Indolence'' between 1834 and 1882 lends credence to the theory that it is identical with ''The Fountain of Fallacy'', a painting which Turner exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in 1839, accompanied by four lines from his own poem entitled ''Fallacies of Hope''.&lt;ref name=Wildman&gt;{{cite web|last=Wildman|first=Stephen|title=Fountain of Fallacy|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/b129vgim.htm|work=The Electronic Edition of John Ruskin's Modern Painters I|publisher=The Ruskin Research Centre, Lancaster University|accessdate=5 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Its Rainbow-dew diffused fell on each anxious lip,&lt;br /&gt;
Working wild fantasy, imagining;&lt;br /&gt;
First, Science in the immeasurable Abyss of thought,&lt;br /&gt;
Measured her orbit slumbering. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contemporary descriptions of the ''Fountain of Fallacy'' apply equally well to ''The Fountain of Indolence''. In 1839, the year it was exhibited, Turner wrote to a Mr. Marshall that ''The Fountain of Fallacy'' was for sale for 400 guineas and that he had no other painting of that size for sale. No subsequent ownership history of ''The Fountain of Fallacy'' is known and the only recorded references to it after its first exhibition are two comments by [[John Ruskin]]. According to Turner expert [[Martin Butlin]], in the [[catalogue raisonné]] ''The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner'', the available evidence indicates "that in fact there was – and is – only one" picture.&lt;ref name=Butlin2&gt;{{cite book|last=Butlin|first=Martin|title=The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner|date=1977|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|author2=Joll, Evelyn |pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise]] in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy who fell through ice at Lake Sainte Louise is awake, recognizing people, officials say|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/stcharles/boy-who-fell-through-ice-at-lake-sainte-louise-is/article_8c0ffb76-be53-5a19-b766-eb88fb9bd4e1.html|accessdate=March 6, 2018|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
When Joyce Smith's fourteen-year-old son John fell through an icy [[Lake St. Louis, Missouri|Missouri lake]] one winter morning, she and her family had seemingly lost everything. At the hospital, John lay lifeless for more than sixty minutes. But Joyce was not ready to give up on her son. She mustered all her faith and strength into one force and cried out to God in a loud voice to save him. Miraculously, her son's heart immediately started beating again.

In the coming days, John would continue to defy every expert, every case history, and every scientific prediction. Sixteen days after falling through the ice and being clinically dead for an hour, he walked out of the hospital under his own power, completely healed.

== Film adaptation ==

'''''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon''''' is a painting by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], started in 1881. The massive painting measures 279&amp;nbsp;cm × 650&amp;nbsp;cm, and is widely considered to be Burne-Jones's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/burne-jones-avalon.htm | title=Burne Jones's last painting to be exhibited in the UK for the first time in over 40 years| publisher=[[Tate Gallery]] | accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW42&gt;Waters, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was originally commissioned from Burne-Jones by his patron [[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle]], to hang on a wall in the library of [[Naworth Castle]]. Howard shared Burne-Jones's affection for the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] and left the choice of topic to the artist.&lt;ref name=M118&gt;Mancoff, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Burne-Jones started working on it in 1881 and continued for 17 years. Within this period, he also designed the stage set for the play ''King Arthur'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]] that premiered in London in January 1895.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;Wildman, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1880s brought the deaths of Burne-Jones's close friends. As they died, the artist experienced mounting isolation and painful awareness of his own mortality.&lt;ref name=M113&gt;Mancoff, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Immersed in his work, Burne-Jones identified himself with Arthur and even adopted Arthur's pose when he himself slept.&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt; By 1885, the association with Arthur reached the point where Burne-Jones had to ask Howard to cancel or revise his original commission, replacing the grand scene with a smaller painting focused on the departed king. Howard agreed to cancellation and never requested his downpayment back. Nevertheless, Burne-Jones returned to the original grand painting, and worked on it for the remaining thirteen years of his life.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; ''Arthur'' became increasingly autobiographical for the artist as he withdrew into himself; "above all the picture is about silence."&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt;

{{quote|How is it you are in ''Avalon'', where I have striven to be with all my might — and how did you get there and how does Arthur the King? ...|Edward Burne-Jones, a letter to a friend in ''[[Avallon]]'', France, 1886&lt;ref name=M117&gt;Mancoff, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Burne-Jones Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon v2.jpg|left|thumb|500px|''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'', complete painting.]]

A popular opinion holds that Burne-Jones modelled Arthur's appearance after [[William Morris]], the last survivor of a once-strong progressive art circle, and that Morris's physical decline was a major inspiration for the painting. However, Debra Mancoff argues that there is no record of Morris posing as Arthur and that the king's image was completed when Morris was in vigorous health.&lt;ref name=M119&gt;Mancoff, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris died in 1896; Burne-Jones lived for two more years and died before the painting was complete. Just one day before his death Burne-Jones continued work on ''Arthur''.&lt;ref name=WW42/&gt; Towards the end of his life he wrote, "I need nothing but my hands and my brain to fashion myself a world to live in that nothing can disturb. In my own land I am king of it." His widow described ''Arthur'' as a "task of love to which [the artist] put no limit of time or labor."&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;

Following the artist's death, the painting in its frame with Latin inscription passed to a neighbour of Burne-Jones's, whose descendants, John and Penryn Monck, sold the work at auction at [[Christie's]] on 26 April 1963 where it was bought by [[Luis A. Ferré]], a politician and founder of the [[Ponce Museum of Art]] who would later become [[Governor of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; Burne-Jones was out of fashion at this time so its export was allowed despite some objections.

''The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon'' is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in [[Puerto Rico]].  However, it was shown for a short time at the [[Tate Britain]] in London while the Ponce museum underwent restoration in 2009&amp;ndash;10.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt;

The painting was on view at the [http://www.museodelprado.es/ Prado Museum] in Madrid: ''The Sleeping Beauty. Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce'' (2 February 2009 - 31 May 2009).

'''''The Scoutmaster''''' is a 1956 painting by American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]]. It was originally created by Rockwell for the 1956 [[Brown &amp; Bigelow]] Boy Scout Calendar. Since then, it has become one of the most collected images that Rockwell created for the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name="NSM"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Scoutmaster by Norman Rockwell|url = http://www.bsamuseum.org/Exhibitions/CellPhoneTour.aspx|website = National Scouting Museum|publisher = Boy Scouts of America|accessdate = June 3, 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131204060437/http://www.bsamuseum.org/Exhibitions/CellPhoneTour.aspx|archivedate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Rockwell set out to create a painting dedicated to the Scoutmasters of the United States.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;  In 1953, he visited the 4th [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|National Scout jamboree]] at [[Irvine Ranch]].&lt;ref name=Oakland&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oakland Area Council|title=The Scoutmaster by Norman Rockwell|url=http://www.sfbac-history.org/OAC_History2.html|publisher=San Francisco Bay Area Council|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell, who used photographs as a source for his paintings, was staging a [[photo shoot]] at the jamboree. He approached a Scoutmaster from Oakland and asked him for four boys to pose for a photo. One of the four chosen was [[Howard Lincoln]] who would become the chairman of [[Nintendo of America]] and later the CEO of the [[Seattle Mariners]]. The four Scouts set up tents and built a fire in the middle of a {{convert|90|F|C}} day.&lt;ref name=Seattle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Patti|title=M's' Lincoln relives Norman Rockwell moment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2005/03/07/newscolumn2.html|publisher=American City Business Journals|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell found a professional Scouter at the jamboree headquarters to pose as the Scoutmaster for the all-day photo shoot.&lt;ref name=Scouting78&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillcourt|first1=Bill|title=Norman Rockwell|journal=Scouting|date=1978|volume=66|issue=3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Lincoln and the other three Scouts each received a $25 check and a letter from Rockwell asking them to sign a release.&lt;ref name=Seattle /&gt; Over the course of the next three years, Rockwell turned the daytime pictures into a nighttime painting. The tents in the painting were modified to be civilian tents with guylines and sidewalls instead of military-style [[Tent#Older tent styles|pup tents]]. It debuted as the 1956 Boy Scout Calendar published by Brown &amp; Bigelow.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;

==Composition==
The painting is a late night scene that features a [[Scoutmaster]], in full uniform, looking into the dying remains of a campfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rockwell and Csatari: A tour de force|journal=Scouting|date=2008|volume=96|issue=2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cookware for that night's dinner is still visible. In the background four Scouts are asleep in two [[tent]]s. Lincoln is in a white shirt directly to the right of the Scoutmaster; his face is visible.&lt;ref name=Seattle /&gt;

==Later uses==
The painting was utilized by the Boy Scouts of America as the cover art for the 1960 edition of the ''Scoutmaster's Handbook'' and an issue of the magazine ''[[Boys' Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Scouting78/&gt;

'''Watchimals''' were a wearable toy, marketed mainly for girls, with a [[LCD]] watch inside. They were made by [[Hasbro]] in their heyday of the mid 1980s. Watchimals took the form of furry wristbands with different animal heads. When the animal head was flipped open, the [[digital watch]] appeared. The [[advertisement]] [[slogan]] was: "Just open his mouth and he'll show you the time! 
They're all soft animal friends with a real watch inside!" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/Toys_Watchimal.htm "Watchimal -- Ghost of the Doll" Retrieved March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
Beginning in 1985, Watchimals were produced in two series.

===First Series===
The first series included six characters: 
*[[Elephant]]
*[[Bear]]
*[[Toucan]]
*[[Peacock]] 
*[[Mouse]] 
*[[Butterfly]]

===Second Series===
In 1986, six more characters were added:
*[[Snail]] 
*[[Dragonfly]]
*[[Dog]]
*[[Goldfish]]
*[[Unicorn]] 
*[[Moose]]

== Overseas Editions ==
Another Watchimal, [[Ladybird]] was primarily marketed in the [[United Kingdom]].  Other [[international]] Watchimals had different color schemes than those in the [[United States]].

== Related Series: Wearimals ==
Wearimals were pairs of furry animals, also made by Hasbro, made in the same style as Watchimals. '''Wearimals''' were about the same size as Watchimals and could be mixed and matched. They included a [[Fastener|clip]] for attaching onto [[hair]], [[clothes]], and [[backpack|schoolbags]]. There were six Wearimals:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/Toys_Watchimal_Wearimals.htm -- "Wearimals -- Ghost of the Doll" Retrieved March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web colors''' are [[color]]s used in [[Web design|displaying web pages]], and the methods for describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as an [[RGB color model|RGB]] triplet or in [[hexadecimal]] format (a ''hex triplet'') or according to their common English names in some cases. A [[color tool]] or other [[graphics software]] is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading [[number sign]] (#).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;York, Richard. ''Beginning CSS'', pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by eight [[bit]]s. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the [[sRGB]] gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.

Colors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to [[scRGB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |at=section 4.2.1. RGB color values |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 |date=7 June 2011 |publisher=W3C |editor1-first=Tantek |editor1-last=Çelik |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Lilley |editor3-first=L. David |editor3-last=Baron |first1=Steven |last1=Pemberton |first2=Brad |last2=Pettit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifying a non-sRGB color this way requires the RGB() function call; it is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax (and thus impossible in legacy [[HTML]] documents that do not use CSS).

The first versions of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] and [[Netscape Navigator]] used the [[X11 color names]] as the basis for their color lists, as both started as [[X Window System]] applications.
Web colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition, [[sRGB]], which relates the [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] of a particular [[phosphor]] set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Color Imaging Handbook By Gaurav Sharma. {{ISBN|0-8493-0900-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world [[Computer monitor|monitors]] and viewing conditions, in order to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without [[color management]]. [[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.

==Hex triplet==
A '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[True Color]] (24-bit RGB) color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:
:Byte 1: red value (color type red)
:Byte 2: green value (color type green)
:Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)
For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.

If any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.

The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or 256&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; = 16,777,216.

===Shorthand hexadecimal form===
An abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1. RGB color values |date=7 June 2011 |editor1-first=Tantek |editor1-last=Çelik |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Lilley |editor3-first=L. David |editor3-last=Baron |first1=Steven |last1=Pemberton |first2=Brad |last2=Pettit |accessdate=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] example:

&lt;source lang="css"&gt;
.threedigit { color: #09C;    }
.sixdigit   { color: #0099CC; } /* same color as above */
&lt;/source&gt;

This shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors), this limitation is sufficient for many text based documents.

===Converting RGB to hexadecimal===
{{See also|Hexadecimal#Conversion}}
RGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the 0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives us the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives us the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives us the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.

Conversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.

==HTML color names==
The [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 "Colors"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):
{{Colornames}}

These 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were "the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification "The BODY element" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X11 color names==
[[File:SVG Recognized color keyword names.svg|thumbnail|SVG Version of X11 color names]]
{{main|X11 color names}}
A number of colors are defined by [[web browser]]s. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].

The list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below. Compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards. This includes the common synonyms: aqua (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and cyan (common sRGB name), magenta (common sRGB name) and fuchsia (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name), gray (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Web-safe colors==
{{Color depth}}
In the mid-90s, many displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50QM5XrxFzQC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=In+the+early+days+of+computing,+many+displays+were+only+capable+of+displaying+256+colors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F3HogVYhVo&amp;sig=8W4JLYE2eJ5VUP8Avn9ApG4yBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqiLChq__WAhVCiVQKHV_EAM8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20early%20days%20of%20computing,%20many%20displays%20were%20only%20capable%20of%20displaying%20256%20colors&amp;f=false|title=Web Design All-in-One For Dummies|last=Jenkins|first=Sue|date=2012-12-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118404119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be dictated by the hardware or changeable by a "color table". When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.

There were various attempts to make a "standard" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 × 6 × 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).

The list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &amp;quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&amp;quot; - Why? Please clarify}}

"Web-safe" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5×5×5 or 4×4×4) were allocated by browsers—the "web safe" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.

{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have 24-bit ([[True Color|TrueColor]]) and the use of "web-safe" colors has fallen into practical disuse.

The "web-safe" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.

{{Web safe colors}}

===Safest web colors===
Designers were encouraged to stick to these 216 "web-safe" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors the "really safe" palette; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CSS colors==
The [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the "HTML4 color keywords" section, which was renamed as "Basic color keywords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 –  Proposed Recommendation - 11.

CSS 2, [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and CSS 2.1 allow web authors to use ''system colors'', which are color names whose values are taken from the [[operating system]], picking the operating system's highlighted text color, or the background color for tooltip controls. This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/ui.html#system-colors |title=User interface – System colors |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CSS3]] color module has [[deprecated]] the use of system colors in favor of CSS3 UI System Appearance property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#css2-system |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.5.1.

The developing CSS3 specification also introduces [[HSL color space]] values to style sheets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#hsl-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.4.

&lt;/source&gt;

On 21 June 2014, the [[CSS WG]] added the color RebeccaPurple to the Editor's Draft of the [[Cascading Style Sheets#CSS 4|CSS4]] Colors module, to commemorate [[Eric A.

==Accessibility==
Some [[Web browser|browsers]] and devices do not support colors. For these displays, or for blind and colorblind users, Web content depending on colors can be unusable or difficult to use.

Either no colors should be specified (to invoke the browser's default colors), or both the background and all foreground colors (such as the colors of plain text, unvisited links, hovered links, active links, and visited links) should be specified to avoid '''black on black''' or '''white on white''' effects.&lt;ref name="w3ctips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/color |title=If You Pick One Color, Pick Them All |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of [[analytical psychology]], the '''Wise Old Woman and the [[Wise Old Man]]''' are [[archetypes]] of the [[Collective Unconscious]]. 'The "wise old woman"...[or] helpful "old woman" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Jacobi, "Symbols in an Individual Analysis" in C. G . Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 331 and p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity'&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; is her male counterpart.

==Individuation==

In Jung's thought, the [[individuation]] process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the intermediate position of '[[Anima and animus|anima or animus]]...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed "[[Mana]]" personalities or "supraordinate" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the ''mother'' ("Primordial Mother" and "[[Earth Mother]]") as a supraordinary personality...as the "self"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''[[guru]]''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "The Process of Individuation", in C. G. Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 226-7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by [[Hecate]] or the [[Crone]] ...the Great Mother'&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, ''The Old Woman's Daughter'' (Texas 2006) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore "for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in Jolande Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung: An Introduction'' (London 1946) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'the "good Wise Man" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure',&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the "terrible mother"'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; 

But judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the "supraordinate personality", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 226 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a "coniunctio oppositorum", a union of opposites.  'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 115 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Workers Film and Photo League''' was an organization of filmmakers, photographers, writers and projectionists in the 1930s, dedicated to using film and photography for social change.

== History ==

Founded in 1930, the WFPL produced documentaries of the U.S. Labor Movement including the National Hunger marches of 1931 and 1932 and the Bonus March 1932. These newsreels were generally not distributed to mainstream theaters, but shown at party or trade union events.  When shown in theaters, they often opened for films produced in Europe or the Soviet Union.  In New York, the "Harry Alan Potamkin Film School" was established by the Workers Film and Photo League to train working-class filmmakers.

Initially affiliated with the [[Workers International Relief]], the group first organized to project films at fundraising events for striking workers.

Although the best known chapter of the WFPL was in New York, groups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, and other cities created and screened documentaries under the "Film and Photo League" moniker.  Nationally, the Film &amp; Photo Leagues emerged as a loosely knit alliance of local organizations that provided leftist visual propaganda. Their efforts during the years of the early Depression helped to define social documentary film and photography as a genre.

Much has been made of the association of the Workers Film and Photo League with the Communist Party, both in the US and abroad. While many members were self identified Marxists and party members, the groups usually functioned independently.  They were largely composed of idealists who saw the documentary film as a vital element of the movement for radical social change.

In 1933 "Workers" was dropped from the title and the New York organization became the Film and Photo League. The FPL survived for another year in New York, where its photographers formed the [[Photo League]]. Some filmmakers formed an independent private production company, others founded Nykino and some, later, the Frontier Film Group.

In other cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, Film and Photo League activities continued throughout the 1930s.

Although many of the films produced by the Film and Photo Leagues were destroyed in a 1935 storage fire in New York, some surviving films can be found at the Museum of Modern Art Film Study Center, New York; Film Center, School of the Art Institute of Chicago; and the Library of Congress, Washington D.C.  A filmography was created by researchers in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-06-02|title=Film and Photo League Filmography compiled by Russell Campbell and William Alexander|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC14folder/FPhotoFilogy.html|website=www.ejumpcut.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Sensorium''' is a natural and inclusive world scent, a work of [[olfactory art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Harris |title=Journal of Aesthetic Education |volume= 13| issue =  4 (Oct. 1979) |pages= 5–15 |jstor= 3331746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artnews1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Pollack |title=Scents and Sensibility |publisher= ARTnews |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.artnews.com/2011/03/01/scents-sensibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[interdisciplinary]] artist [[Gayil Nalls]], who is based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview conducted by Dr. Avery Gilbert, First Nerve (online) |date=April 4, 2009 |url= http://firstnerve.com/2009/04/portrait-of-artist-gayil-nalls.html |publisher=firstnerve.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale conceptual project and [[social sculpture]], the world scent comprises the most culturally significant scents of 225 countries combined proportionally according to the statistical population data of the year 2000. ''World Sensorium'' has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] and the [[President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities]] as a global peace project and has been internationally exhibited in large public events, museums and galleries since its creation in 1999.

The research for the creation of ''World Sensorium'' established smells from natural flora that triggered [[olfactory memory]] for the majority of people of each nation, with the goal of interpreting the relationship between world flora and human numbers on earth, and to bring new awareness of the living world and its influence on the [[human spirit]] and [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. Through this work, Nalls has sought to foster an understanding of the larger evolutionary [[social construct]] of knowledge we share with others via the [[senses]].

The project of ''World Sensorium'' can be categorized as a contribution to the genres of Olfactory Art and Aesthetics, [[Participatory art]], and [[environmental art]] and functions along the trajectories of avant-garde and political or activist art.

==Creative Inspiration==

===Berlin Wall===
Nalls envisioned this concept for a “world scent” in 1989, eleven years prior to its completion and debut release. She describes the moment of inspiration for the formula as having occurred on December 28 of that year at the Brandenberg Gate, as the crowd pulled her on top of the [[Berlin Wall]]. As the connectivity passed through the bodies gathered, she envisioned a formula for ''World Sensorium'' where everyone would be counted.

===Relationship to Permutatude Theory===
''World Sensorium'' was created for the aesthetic of mass anatomy to evoke global memory and to evolve a metabolic collective. [[Permutatude Theory]] and science form a significant background to the ongoing project, as do the processes of cultural transformation and globalization. As a theoretical construct, conceived to be an embodied consciousness of “one world” the olfactory sculpture critically engages individuals with their sense of smell, often in performative settings.

==Methodology==

===Determination of ingredients===
Historical scents of all the countries of the world, culturally significant in medicine, mythology, the arts, anthropology, spiritual practices, diet and memory were identified based on survey research to obtain quantitative information that supplied the raw data for the creation of the scent, establishing the constituent natural plant oils “from tree, flower, grass or herb”.&lt;ref&gt;G. Nalls, inscription on Times Square World Sensorium Papperworks, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
Many of the plants were identified in local vernacular and required additional research to verify the Latin or English names. In some instances an English name did not exist.  “Nalls located botanical taxonomy scholars from the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and ethno-botanists from the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]] in Hawaii to assist in properly identifying the botanical names”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesforlivingwell.com/Articles/worldsensorium.html Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,]” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt; materials which had been referred to in colloquial terms such as, Senegal: Gowe ([[Cyperus articulatus]]), no English name, and American Samoa: Mos’oi ([[Cananga odorata]]), English name Ylang-ylang.

“The goal was to have to have each flora’s complex molecular compositions represented in its entirety so as to be perceived by humans as closely as it would if it were experienced in its habitat, in order to evoke the same psychological ad emotional responses, and neurological and immune functions as in the traditions of the culture.”&lt;ref&gt;(G. Nalls, "World Sensorium: Theory Practice and Significance of The World Social Olfactory Sculpture'', (dissertation), SmartLab, UEL, (September 2007) p.30)&lt;/ref&gt; To this end all raw materials were derived straight from botanical sources by means of distillation or extraction.

===Formula===
The composition of these ingredients was based on projected population percentages for each individual country for the year 2000. Everyone was counted.

==Impact as World Peace Project==

===Global communications===
In her quantitative research, Nalls crossed political boundaries in dialog with “countries the United States doesn’t get along with, such as Iran ([[rose]]), Iraq ([[date palm]]) Libya ([[orange blossom]]) and Cuba ([[tobacco]]).”&lt;ref&gt;Rita Giordano, “Artist to Unleash Global Scent of Peace Over Times Square,” The Denver Post, Denver, CO, December 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, communications spanned several months, but an especially “poignant moment in the creation of ''World Sensorium'' was the day the representative from the Israeli Embassy in Washington and the Palestinian representative from the united Nations called Nalls by phone within minutes of each other to report that their national choices were both the Olive tree because of its long revered association with peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition and Honors===
In 1998, in recognition of Nalls’ outstanding creative achievement, ''World Sensorium'' was endorsed by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was granted sponsorship by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an original cultural initiative building goodwill and peace in conjunction with the United Nation's International Year for Culture of Peace. In his letter to Nalls, Director-General, Dr. Federico Mayor, a brain biochemist, said that ''World Sensorium'' is a “highly original cultural initiative” that “will certainly contribute to creating a climate of goodwill and peace at this memorable moment in time” leading to “understanding and collaboration among nations”.&lt;ref&gt;As stated in letter to Nalls, September 5, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Significance==

===Olfactory Art and Aesthetics===
With ''World Sensorium'' and more recent works, Nalls has advanced concepts of aesthetics to consider the olfactory sense over the historically privileged sense of vision. While the visual remains dominant, artists have and are now increasingly working with the sense of smell to produce emotionally and phenomenologically resonant works in the emergent genre of Olfactory Art. Nalls “like many other olfactory artists, uses only natural fragrances and essential oils. “I call it ‘rewilding the mind,’” she says.&lt;ref name="artnews1"/&gt;

===Participatory Art===
For Nalls, the connection between olfaction and social or participatory art is rooted in the evolutionary biology of the sense of smell. As the oldest sense, olfaction has the uncanny ability to trigger memory (individual and collective), and its significant role in chemosensory communication is critical to the collective action that is necessary for participatory social and art processes. 
		
''World Sensorium'' is a participatory project in its all-inclusive ethos, Nalls’ intention for its en masse experience, and in its very creation which at times required to assistance of volunteers to gather the phytogenic materials.  “[[Randia aculeata]] an ingredient from the Netherlands 	Antilles, could only be found locally in Florida. A team was rushed to the site before Hurricane Lenny came in and swept through the area.” to harvest the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Klepacki, “Times Square Revelers To Ring in New Fragrance,” Women’s Wear Daily, December 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avant-gardism and Political Art===
In its use of extant culturally significant plant materials, Nalls advances the advant-garde notion that art should be brought closer to the praxis of life. ''World Sensorium'' is all-inclusive in its conception–a reflection of actual human-plant relations, making every experience of ''World Sensorium'' a connection to the world's collective ecology and human consciousness. When experienced en masse as in Times Square, Nalls initiated a collective metabolic experience, and introduced a universal language for cross-cultural efforts toward peace, by evoking our co-evolution with nature. Ken Johnson called ''World Sensorium'' a "utopian project" and "an olfactory metaphor for world unity" by an "earnest and rather grandiose conceptualist".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken, Art in Review, New York Times, January 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
