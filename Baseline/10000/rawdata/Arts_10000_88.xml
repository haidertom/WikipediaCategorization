'''Adrian Mikołaj Głębocki''' (8 September 1833, [[Panki, Silesian Voivodeship|Panki]] - 15 May 1905, [[Warsaw]]) was a Polish painter, lithographer and art teacher.

==Biography==
After completing secondary school in 1850, he studied at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw until 1857, where his primary instructor was [[Rafał Hadziewicz]]. This was followed by studies in Paris, Vienna and Munich. After completing his studies, he worked briefly in Warsaw as a scenery painter for the set designer, Antonio Sacchetti (1790–1870).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/cgi-bin/obiekt.cgi?act=1&amp;qt=1462656852&amp;nr=12225 Biographical notes] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1863, he lived in  [[Częstochowa]], where he taught at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. 
[[File:Głębocki-JasnaGora.jpg|thumb|350px|Pilgrims Arriving at Jasna Góra]] 
During this time, he created numerous works related to the [[Kalisz Region]]. Many of the buildings he depicted no longer exist, so his paintings have acquired great documentary value. His work includes an album of 52 watercolors of the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] and the ceremonies there. He often accompanied his works with descriptions and commentary, and wrote several articles on the monuments of the region.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.absolwenci.sieniu.czest.pl/index.php?show=art&amp;which=665 Brief biography] @ Absolwenci Sienkiewicza.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1873, he moved to Warsaw. There, he began to provide illustrations for ''Kłosach'' (Ears), ''{{ill|Biesiada Literacka|pl}}'' (Literary Feast) and the ''[[Tygodnik Ilustrowany]]''. He also wrote a major article about his work in Częstochowa for the literary journal ''Wiek'' and continued teaching at a school for the deaf as well as giving private lessons.&lt;ref name="AA" /&gt;  

Many of his lithographs are arranged in "cycles" on religious and historical themes. He also produced several art books for children, including some with cut-out patterns for toys.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

==Cool==

In ''African Art in Motion'', African art scholar and [[Yale]] professor [[Robert Farris Thompson]] turns his attention to cool in both the African and [[African-American]] contexts:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mind of an elder within the body of the young is suggested by the striking African custom of dancing "hot" with a "cool" unsmiling face. This quality seems to have haunted [[Ten Rhyne]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 1673 and it struck the imagination of an early observer of strongly African-influenced dancing in [[Louisiana]] in the early nineteenth century, who noted "thumping ecstasy" and "intense solemnity of mien." The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history:  
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is interesting that what remains a spiritual principle in some parts of Africa and the rare African-influenced portions of the modern U.S.A., such as [[Tidelands|tidewater]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], becomes in the mainline [[African American|Afro-American]] urban culture an element of contemporary street behavior:
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Negro]] boys…have a 'cool' way of walking in which the upper trunk and pelvis rock fore and aft while the head remains stable with the eyes looking straight ahead. The…walk is quite slow, and the Negroes take it as a way of 'strutting' or 'showing off'....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
The cool style of male walking in the United States is called ''bopping'' ...  Mystical coolness in Africa has changed in urban African-American assertions of independent power. But the functions, to heal and gather strength, partially remain. And the name ''cool'' [''kule''], remains. And the body is still played in two patterns, one stable, the other active, part energy and part mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson|first=Robert Farris |authorlink=Robert Farris Thompson| title=African Art in Motion |year=1974 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02703-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Afrofuturism''' is a cultural [[aesthetic]], philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African/African Diaspora culture with technology. It combines elements of [[science fiction]], [[historical fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Afrocentrism]] and [[magic realism]] with non-Western [[Cosmology|cosmologies]] in order to critique the present-day dilemmas of [[black people]] and to interrogate and re-examine historical events. It was coined by Mark Dery in 1994 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by [[Alondra Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Rambsy II| first = Howard| title = A Notebook on Afrofuturism| work = Cultural Front| accessdate = 2014-03-26| date = 2012-04-14| url = http://www.culturalfront.org/2012/04/notebook-on-afrofuturism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrofuturism addresses themes and concerns of the [[African diaspora]] through a [[technoculture]] and [[science fiction]] lens, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afrodiasporic experiences.&lt;ref name="history-future"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|title=Afrofuturism, science fiction, and the history of the future|url=http://sdonline.org/42/afrofuturism-science-fiction-and-the-history-of-the-future/|journal=Socialism and Democracy|date=November 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=41–60|doi=10.1080/08854300600950236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of [[Samuel R.

==History==
===Mid-late 20th century development===
Despite Afrofuturism being coined in 1993, scholars tend to agree that Afrofuturistic music, art and text became more common and widespread in the late 1950s. The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]]. For many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]]. 

Afrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] ("pure cloned funk"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of "certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies".

Other musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],&lt;ref name=reddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/376/392 |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–90 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcleus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976–1986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotti Golden]] &amp; Richard Scher, electro hip hop producer/writers of [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]", a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, described as a "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1994 essay "Black to the Future", began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art. Dery dubbed this phenomenon "Afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dery|first=Mark|date=1994|title=Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose|url=https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf|journal=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture|location=Durham, NC|publisher=Duke University Press|page=180|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural critic [[Kodwo Eshun]], British journalist [[Mark Sinker]] was theorizing a form of Afrofuturism in the pages of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', a British music magazine, as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1992|title=Black Science Fiction|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-wire/february-1992-(issue-96)-35378/30/2/|journal=The Wire|publisher=Exact Editions Ltd.|page=30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrofuturist ideas have further been expanded by scholars like [[Alondra Nelson]], [[Greg Tate]], [[Tricia Rose]], [[Kodwo Eshun]], and others.&lt;ref name=history-future /&gt; In an interview, Alondra Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people which covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a utopic future. The idea of "alien" or "other" is a theme often explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Alondra Nelson (Interviewee) | title = Afrofuturism |medium = Youtube | year = 2010 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFhEjaal5js}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about a so-called "[[digital divide]]".&lt;ref name="Nelson-Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1527-1951 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–15 | last = Nelson | first = Alondra | title = Introduction: Future Texts | journal = Social Text: Special Issue on Afrofuturism | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | year = 2002 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/v020/20.2nelson01.html | doi=10.1215/01642472-20-2_71-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide overemphasizes the association of racial and economic inequality with limited access to technology.  This association then begins to construct blackness "as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress".&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt; As a critique of the neo-critical argument that the future's history-less identities will end burdensome stigma, Afrofuturism holds that history should remain a part of identity, particularly in terms of race.&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt;

===21st century===

A new generation of recording artists have embraced Afrofuturism into their music and fashion, including [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Beyoncé]]. This tradition continues from artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Janelle Monáe]], who incorporated cyborg themes and metallics into their style.&lt;ref name="La Ferla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Afrofuturism: The Next Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other 21st century musicians who have been characterized as Afrofuturist include singer [[FKA Twigs]],&lt;ref name="La Ferla"/&gt; musical duo [[Ibeyi]],&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; and DJ/producer [[Ras G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism takes flight: from Sun Ra to Janelle Monáe|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=2014-07-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, artists such as Rihanna and Beyoncé have often been interpreted by the public as having some non-human elements about them, exhibited in both their performances, and in their day to day interactions. Because the tabloids have so much control over the way that information is digested, the public receives images of these women that are distant and controlled solely by the media, and thus, these women are often painted as angry or unfeeling. Scholars such as Robin James have interrogated and expanded upon the work of Kodwo Eshun, and coined the idea of the "robo-diva". These scholars both argue that the Black experience has always been more alien than it has been human, and James connects the mechanics of the middle passage to alien abduction through concepts of kidnapping, isolation, and bowing down to an unknown power. Kodwo Eshun also posits that perhaps the categorization of "human" has no use in the Black community, and that instead, the category of "robot" is not only more powerful, but more accurately representative of the positioning in the social hierarchy in which Black people exist in the present day. Because musical artists (Rihanna, Beyoncé) exhibit such non-human qualities, they are often ostracized for being "cold" or "mechanical". The white patriarchy both fears and admires such artists due to their unapologetic displays of female sexuality and its interactions with technology. These fears then propel the virgin/whore dichotomy that stems from the trope of the Jezebel, and serves to further the racialized projections of stereotypes onto Black females in the music industry.

[[Janelle Monáe]] has made a conscious effort to restore Afrofuturist cosmology to the forefront of urban contemporary music. Her notable works include the music videos "Prime Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=janellemonae|title=Janelle Monáe – PrimeTime ft.

This ArchAndroid role reflects earlier Afrofuturistic figures Sun Ra and George Clinton, who created their own visuals as extraterrestrial beings rescuing African-Americans from the oppressive natures of Earth.

Chicago is home to a vibrant community of artists exploring Afrofuturism. [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], known for his Soundsuits project, has helped develop younger talent as the director of the graduate fashion program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other artists include visual artists Hebru Brantley as well as contemporary artist [[Rashid Johnson]], a Chicago native currently based in New York. In 2013, Chicago resident Ytasha L.

== Literature ==

The creation of the term Afrofuturism in the 1990s was often primarily used to categorize "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture,"&lt;ref name="Bould"&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon expanded to include artistic, scientific, and spiritual practices throughout the [[African diaspora]]. Contemporary practice retroactively identifies and documents historical instances of Afrofuturist practice and integrates them into the canon. For example, the [[Dark Matter (series)|Dark Matter]] anthologies edited by [[Sheree Thomas]] feature contemporary [[Black science fiction]], discuss Ralph Ellison's [[Invisible Man]] in her introduction, "Looking for the Invisible," and also include older works by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], and [[George S. Schuyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Sheree|authorlink=Sheree Thomas |editor-first=Sheree |editor-last=Thomas |title=Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora |year=2000|publisher=Warner Aspect |isbn=0446525839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Yazsek argues that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel, ''[[Invisible Man]]'', should be thought of as a predecessor to Afrofuturist literature. Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better – or even any –  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for "this kind of future-historical art" to those who succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=297–313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes. [[Nnedi Okorafor]] has been labeled this way, both for her [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Hugo Award]]-winning [[Binti (novel)|Binti]] novella series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384030/nnedi-okorafor-binti-home-afrofuturist-science-fiction-review|title=The Binti novellas are fun, bite-sized stories of interstellar Afrofuturism|date=2017-01-25|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for her novel ''[[Who Fears Death]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-far-out-guide-to-afrofuturism-and-black-magic_us_5711403fe4b0060ccda34a37|title=Your Brief And Far-Out Guide To Afrofuturism|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|date=2016-04-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Barnes]] has been called an Afrofuturist author for his alternate-history novels ''[[Lion's Blood]]'' and ''[[Zulu Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; [[N.

"Loving the Alien."

"A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fourth book of the science fiction [[Patternist series]], ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', particularly fits ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth century America.&lt;ref name="Canavan"&gt;Canavan, Gerry.

===The grotesque===

In the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a "mutant" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D.

===Alienation===
Afrofuturism takes representations of the lived realities of black people in the past and present, and reexamines the narratives to attempt to build new truths outside of the dominant cultural narrative. By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|year=|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using "extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287–302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, "black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.

This is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their "history" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schrödinger's cat of African American past.

Another example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.

=== Reclamation ===
Ostensibly, Afrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery first coined the term, he says Afrofuturism as "giving rise to a troubling antinomy". This means that the seeming contradiction of a past being snuffed out and the writing of a future sees its possibilities in Afrofuturism. Furthermore, this Afrofuturism kind of story telling is not regulated to one aspect of communication. It is in novels and essays, academic writings and in music, but by its creation, it is ultimately reclaiming some type of autonomy over one's story that has historically been restricted.

Therefore, when Afrofuturism manifests itself in the music of the 80's and beyond, it is under the Afrofuturist's sensibility. It is in this way that, as Mark Dery says, "African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart". Because the ancestors of African Americans were forcibly removed from their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.

Afrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as "The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement".&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"/&gt; Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broaden to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.

In conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like "magical Negroes" or "references to Sun Ra". Through this identification of "overused tropes" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled "The Mundane Afrofuturist promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.

An '''after action report''' (or '''AAR''') is any form of [[retrospective]] analysis on a given sequence of goal-oriented actions previously undertaken, generally by the author themselves.

The two principal forms of AARs are the [[literary]] AAR, intended for recreational use, and the analytical AAR, exercised as part of a process of [[performance evaluation]] and improvement. In most cases, AARs are a combination of both. Most analytical AARs are conducted over a contemporary problem or situation that has occurred in the past, is happening right now, or what could happen in the future.

== History ==
The first AARs were developed by [[army generals]]. One of the first and best examples of an AAR is [[Julius Caesar]]’s “[[Commentaries on the Gallic War]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Rick|title=Feedback toolkit : 16 tools for better communication in the workplace|date=2011|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=1439840938|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x_vgdUxhj5oC&amp;lpg=PT57&amp;dq=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;pg=PT57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary examples of AARs include project evaluations in [[business]], as well as summaries of large gaming sessions in [[videogame]] culture.

== Literary AARS ==
Literary AARs can be formal or informal documents that seek syntax and linguistic improvement. Many [[research papers]] published under an academic journal can be considered a literary AAR. There might not be much of a difference between literary AARs and analytical AARs in terms of research papers, but the key difference is analytical seeks to improve performance while literary seeks to improve style.

== Analytical AARs ==
Analytical AARs are formal [[documents]] intended to serve as aids to performance evaluation and improvement, by registering situation–response interactions, analyzing critical procedures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, and proposing adjustments and recommendations. 

=== Objectives ===
Analytical AARs have three central objectives:

* Identifying problematic issues and needs for improvement
* Proposing measures to counteract problematic elements
* Obtaining “lessons learned”

=== Structure ===
#Overview
#Goals and objectives
#Analysis of outcomes
#Analysis of the performance shown on critical tasks
#Summary
#Recommendations

=== Examples ===
* The U.S. Army has adopted the After Action Review (AAR) as the primary method for delivering feedback after unit training exercises. Likewise, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) has supported the development and implementation of AAR procedures for over 20 years. The After Action Review Process is critical to forming an After Action Report. Notes from the review often find themselves in the report. &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. E., &amp; Meliza, L. L. (1999). Foundations of the after action review process, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another example of an After Action Report is the global status reported on [[road safety]]. Studies are conducted in order to determine how severe road safety concerns are in a particular area. After this, a report is created over the conditional event that is road safety, and a reflection is written with insight into how road safety can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Disability, W. H. O. D. of V. and I. P. and, Prevention, W. H. O. V. and I., &amp; Organization, W. H. (2009). Global status report on road safety: Time for action. World Health Organization, 1-227.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise reports are a form of analytical AARs and could be peer-reviewed by an expert who might make suggestions to one's workout routine. Exercise reports find themselves following the same structure as a general AAR. A draft report can be written before workouts, and a follow-up report could be written afterward detailing steps the user could act upon in order to improve their work ethic. The exerciser looking at their own report would know what they need to improve upon in the future, and could practice that skill in order to perfect it.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, C. L. (1995). The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review. Research in Nursing &amp; Health, 18(2), 105–121. https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.4770180205&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alicia Leeke''', a native South Carolinian, is a [[Painting|painter]] and [[artist]] working in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and Charleston, South Carolina. She first became known for her [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionistic]] style and incorporation of [[Fauvism]]. Her artwork is distinctive for its dry brush painting technique, gentle distortion of [[linear perspective]], and use of thick line and brush strokes.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;

She became widely known for her curated exhibition, View From Under the Microscope, which uses phytoplankton to garner awareness about climate change and ocean acidification.

== Early life ==
Leeke was born in Columbia, [[South Carolina]]. She began her education at [[Columbia College (South Carolina)|Columbia College]],&lt;ref name="Saatchi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saatchionline.com/leekeka | title=Alicia Leeke | publisher=Saatchi Online | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an all-girls, private liberal arts school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiasc.edu/about/about-columbia-college | title=Why Columbia College? | publisher=Columbia College | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study biology in hopes of becoming a veterinarian.

During her sophomore year she vacationed in Paris and visited the Louvre, where she fell in love with the French Impressionists and solidified her passion for painting. She also visited her most inspiring spot in France, Montmartre. She later transferred to the [[University of South Carolina]] where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Journalism]].&lt;ref name="From Sketches"&gt;{{cite news | author=Deena C. Bouknight | date= July 1, 2006 | title=From Sketches to Scarves, Her Art Evolves | work=The State Newspaper | page=E3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, she worked in computer graphics and went on to work for six years at the [[South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control]] as the Art Director.&lt;ref name="World Muse"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeke then worked at [[General Binding Corporation]] (GBC) in outside sales.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt; Just a year after her employment at GBC, she began taking art classes again at the [[Columbia Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt; and used her spare time off work to attend art shows and sell work in Atlanta and Chicago. She also studied under Virginia Anderson and Ginger Munnerlin.&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt; Inspired by the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionist]] masters, she further developed her own loose, abstract style. She was named by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]'s Red Sky Gallery as an Emerging Artist in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url=http://www.carolinaarts.com/506gallery80808.html | title=Gallery 80808 in Columbia, SC, Features Works by Alicia Leeke | publisher=Shoestring Publishing Company | work=Carolina Arts | date=May 2006 | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2008, she experimented with her palette by using a technique known as [[Color Field painting]] and began painting city and landscapes in bright, vibrant colors.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt;  She developed a brushstroke style,&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt; using acrylics in a way to give the appearance of oils and included "intense black lines."&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;

Her company underwent a merger in 2008 and she took the opportunity to embark on her dream of becoming a full-time, self-supporting artist.

== Art career ==
Leeke compares a series of art in a body of work to that of multiple product lines in sales. She has paintings produced in a series over time including: abstracts, landscapes, cityscapes, and the most recent conceptual works in digital media.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her travels to paint landscapes during ''[[plein air]]'' painting sessions led her to produce a body of beautiful abstract paintings inspired by nature’s ever-changing scenery. Although some paintings may take up to a year, she generally prefers to make a painting ''[[alla prima]]'', all in one sitting.

More recently, she is inspired by photographers Susan Kae Grant of Texas and John E. Powell of Columbia, SC to produce a body of work combining conceptual art, photography and digital mixed media.

Leeke has also painted and marketed silk scarves and other consumer products, such as mouse pads, coloring books, and greeting cards.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; Leeke has been invited to exhibit her art in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and has art collectors around the globe.

=== Subject, themes, and methods ===
While the majority of her art involves abstract [[cityscape]]s and [[landscape]]s,&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Margaret Gregory | date=October 2009 | url=http://issuu.com/colametro/docs/october2009 | title=Color Her World: Artist Alicia Leeke’s vibrant home | work=Columbia Metropolitan | pages=48–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she also focuses on conceptual and science-based work.

==== Conceptual work ====
In 2014, she worked on a series of digital mixed media works that address the issues of consumerism and manufacturing excess by society’s overconsumption. Leeke’s concept for the show was to encourage consumers to choose more wisely and spend more for quality merchandise versus throwing it away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Science-based work ====
Other themes explored in her work are based on science and biology. Leeke was awarded a grant by the Charleston Scientific and Cultural Education Fund to produce a traveling exhibition in 2015 entitled: View from Under the Microscope: Science-based Learning Through Art. The exhibition consists of 18 vibrant, digitally created paintings that educate the non-scientific community about the importance phytoplankton play in relation to all living things on the planet and the need to maintain healthy, sustainable oceans and water bodies.

=== Influence ===
Leeke’s work is inspired by [[South Carolina]]'s coastal landscape as well as Columbia landmarks, New York, [[Paris]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt; The quaint street scenes and sprawling landscapes found in her paintings strive to capture the essence of common events and convert them into lively images of color and movement. During her second trip to [[Montmartre]], [[France]] in 2009, Leeke developed an interest in Fauvism and began to incorporate intense black lines into her work.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt;

Leeke’s visits to Europe served as inspiration for many of her works. Her Columbia cityscapes often have the charming appeal of street scenes in Paris, like the painting, ''Nonnah’s'', in which she captures Columbia's vista and Paris' personality.&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt;

She has been influenced by the works of French Impressionist masters, such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], [[Georges Rouault]],&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; [[Edgar Degas]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Piet Mondrian]].&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; She was inspired by the way they conveyed social conscience, history and architecture.&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;

The '''Altar frontal from Tavèrnoles''' is [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar]] frontal exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Guia del Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.p. 25. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=9ba1ca9999917353f2a3de632ab4a30a7123d7e5bc3f07940be42bb77e37f6ab?inventoryNumber=015786-CJT&amp;lang=en The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:SantPere SeuUrgell MNAC-015867 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibition of the frontal inside [[National Art Museum of Catalonia|MNAC]].]]
The altar from Sant Serni de Tavèrnoles stands out on account of its size, the composition and the subject depicted, a series of bishop saints.

The dimensions of this item are larger than is usual in known altar frontals. This suggested the possibility that it was a sarcophagus or an altarpiece, but the size and importance of the monastery it came from allowed large liturgical celebrations that would have required an altar of these proportions. The work depicts nine bishop saints, of which the central figure is possibly St Sernin, patron of the monastery the item comes from and bishop and martyr in [[Toulouse]].

This subject is very uncommon in panel painting, which used to concentrate the decoration around a central figure and arrange the scenes or figures in registers. On the sides, which were obviously painted by a different artist, are the bishops Martin and Bricius, identified by inscriptions.

The little we know about this altar has made stylistic analysis of the frontal our main source of information and there are various interpretations of it. The stylisation of the figures and the ornamental effect of the almost seriated rhythm of the personages have associated it with the resources used in mural painting, while such aspects as the precision of the line in defining the drapery have linked it to the decoration characteristic of miniaturists. However, the work could have belonged to a workshop connected with [[La Seu d'Urgell]], for which reason it has been installed - inside de Museum - in the apse of La Seu d'Urgell.

[[File:Ebony Bones backup performer.jpg|thumb|One of the Wives, the backing vocalists for English singer [[Ebony Bones]]]]
'''Backing vocalists''' (British English) or '''backup singers''' (American English) are [[singer]]s who provide [[vocal harmony]] with the [[lead vocalist]] or other backing vocalists. In some cases, a backing vocalist may sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist's entry or to sing a [[counter-melody]]. Backing vocalists are used in a broad range of [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[world music]] styles.

Solo artists may employ professional backing vocalists in studio recording sessions as well as during concerts. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands (e.g., the [[power trio]]), the musicians doing backing vocals also play instruments, such as guitar, electric bass, drums, or keyboards. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Afro-Cuban]] groups, backing singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backing singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The style of singing used by backing singers varies according to the type of song and the genre of music the band plays. In pop and country songs, backing vocalists may perform vocal harmony parts to support the lead vocalist. In hardcore punk or rockabilly, other band members who play instruments may sing or shout backing vocals during the chorus (refrain) section of the songs.

==Terminology==
Alternative terms for backing vocalists include ''backing singers'', ''backing vocals'', ''additional vocals'' or, particularly in the United States and Canada, ''backup singers'' or sometimes ''background singers'' or ''harmony vocalists''.

==Examples==
While some bands use performers whose sole on-stage role is performing backing vocals, it is common for backing singers to have other roles. Two notable examples of band members who sang back-up are [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Beatles]]. The Beach Boys were well known for their close vocal harmonies, occasionally with all five members singing at once such as "[[In My Room]]" and "[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]". All five members would sing lead, although most often [[Brian Wilson]] or [[Mike Love]] would sing lead with guitarists [[Carl Wilson]] and [[Al Jardine]] and drummer [[Dennis Wilson]] singing background harmonies. 

The Beatles were also known for their close style of vocal harmonies{{opinion|date=September 2011}} – all Beatles members sang both lead and backing vocals at some point, especially [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], who frequently supported each other with harmonies, often with fellow Beatle [[George Harrison]] joining in. [[Ringo Starr]], while not as prominent in the role of backing singer as his three bandmates due to his distinctive voice, can be heard singing backing vocals in such tracks as "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]" and "[[Carry That Weight]]".  Examples of three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison include "[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]", "[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]", "[[Day Tripper]]", and "[[This Boy]]".
The members of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] and [[Bee Gees]] all each wrote songs and sang back-up or lead vocals and played various instruments on their albums and various collaborations with each other.

Former [[guitarist]] [[John Frusciante]] and current guitarist [[Josh Klinghoffer]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] sing nearly all backing vocals (few songs were recorded without backing vocals), often singing some parts without accompaniment from lead vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]]. The band's bassist [[Michael Balzary|Flea]] occasionally filled in for additional vocals. Frusciante usually sang one song by himself during concerts. Another example is "No Frontiers" by [[The Corrs]], which is sung by Sharon and Caroline.

Other backing vocalists include [[Sebastien Lefebvre]] ([[rhythm guitarist]] at the same time) and [[David Desrosiers]] ([[Bass guitarist]], also at the same time ) for [[pop punk]] band [[Simple Plan]], [[John Petrucci]] of [[Dream Theater]], and guitarists [[Zacky Vengeance]] and [[Synyster Gates]] of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Avenged Sevenfold]].

==Lead singers who record backing vocals==
In the recording studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by [[overdubbing]] with a [[multitrack recording]] system. A multitrack recording system enables the [[record producer]] to add many layers of recordings over top of each other. Using a multitrack system, a lead vocalist can record his or her own backing vocals, and then record the lead vocal part over top. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because the sound of their own harmonies will blend well with their main vocal. 

One famous example is [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] singing the first part of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" himself by overdubbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAlpine|first1=Fraser|title=10 Things You May Not Know About Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-queens-bohemian-rhapsody|publisher=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=16 May 2017|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Stump]] of [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Wednesday 13]], in his own band, and as the lead and backing vocalist of [[Murderdolls]], [[Ian Gillan]] of [[Deep Purple]], [[Simon Le Bon]] of [[Duran Duran]] and [[Brad Delp]] of [[Boston (band)|Boston]] also recorded lead and backing vocals for their albums.

With the exception of a few songs on each album, [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Richard Marx]] sing all of the background vocals for their songs. [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[the Cure]] not only sings his own backing vocals in the studio, but also doesn't perform with backing vocalists when playing live.

==Different approaches==
Many [[metalcore]] and some [[post-hardcore]] bands, such as [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[Haste the Day]] and [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]] feature a main vocalist who performs using [[harsh vocals]], whilst the backing vocalist sings harmonies ([[clean vocals]]) during choruses to create a contrast. Some bands, such as [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[Finch (American band)|Finch]] have the backing singers do harsh vocals to highlight specific lyrics.

[[Pop music|Pop]] and [[R&amp;B]] vocalists such as [[Diana Ross]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Faith Evans]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Mary J. Blige]] and [[Amerie]] have become known specifically for not only recording their own backing vocals, but for arranging their own multi-tracked vocals and even developing highly complex harmonies and arrangements.  When they perform live, they may have backing vocalists who impersonate their voices.

==Unusual backing vocal styles==
Some bands use backing vocals in order to contrast with the lead singer who may be performing an unusual vocal technique. For example, [[Brian "Head" Welch]], the [[lead guitarist]] of the band [[Korn]], performed backing vocals on several songs, and notably on the song "[[Ball Tongue]]", he screams the chorus while lead vocalist [[Jonathan Davis]] sings incomprehensible [[scat singing|scat vocals]]. Similarly, the Canadian [[deathcore]] group [[Despised Icon]] uses two vocalists, one performing screams and another performing low, growling [[death grunt]]s who alternate, and sometimes sing in unison to highlight certain lyrics. In [[rap music]], a background rapper who chants and rhymes to support the main artist is often referred to as [[hype man]].

==Career paths==
Working as a backing singer can give a vocalist the onstage experience and vocal training they need to develop into a lead vocalist. A number of lead vocalists such as [[Ace Frehley]], [[Richard Marx]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Cher]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Jerry Only]], [[Jerry Cantrell]], [[Jason Newsted]], [[Dee Dee Ramone]] and [[Elton John]], learned their craft as backing singers, or singing backing vocals as part of a choir.{{fact|date=May 2013}}&lt;!-- These unsourced lists can be a real source of Hoaxing on WP...people just add in names for fun --&gt;

'''Balochi cinema''' refers to the [[Balochi language|Balochi-language]] film industry in [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and among the [[Baloch diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Taheri"/&gt;

==History==
The first Balochi feature film, ''Hammal-o-Mahganj'', was produced by [[Anwar Iqbal]] and released in Pakistan in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan Cinema, 1947-1997|first=Mushtaq|last=Gazdar|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1997|page=146|isbn=9780195778175}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film never made it to the screen amidst protests by cultural activists who alleged it misrepresented Baloch culture.&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/117478-A-new-lease-of-life-for-Balochi-cinema|title=A new lease of life for Balochi cinema?|work=The News|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Zia-ur|last=Rehman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slogan used by the protest movement was "Balochi film chalay ga tou cinema jalay ga" (If Balochi films are screened, cinemas will be burnt).&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; Analysts believe the film's release became politicised, as [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] activists favoured the film while [[Baloch nationalism|Baloch nationalist]] groups opposed it. Iqbal later arranged a private screening of the film to address the reservations, where Sindh's labour minister cum PPP leader Abdullah Baloch was a key attendee. According to ''[[The News International|The News]]'', those who viewed it "agreed that the film did not have anything that went against the Baloch culture".&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; The falling quality of erstwhile [[Punjabi cinema|Punjabi]] and [[Pashto cinema|Pashto]] cinema reportedly contributed to the Baloch activist's sentiments.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt; This event is believed to have dented the Balochi film industry's initial growth.&lt;ref name="Rehman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DP"/&gt;

In 1989, the Iranian film ''[[Dadshah]]'' was released in Balochi dubbing. The film was based on Mir [[Dad Shah]] of [[Iranian Balochistan]].&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://balochistanvoices.com/2016/04/balochi-film-industry/|title=Balochi Film Industry|first=Yasmeen|last=Baloch|work=Balochistan Voices|date=3 April 2016|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent years, cinema growth in Balochistan remained slow in line with the [[Cinema of Pakistan#Decline of cinema theatres|stagnant growth]] of Pakistan's film industry.&lt;ref name="CITEREFCinemaThreatreDecline"/&gt; An uncertain security situation further led to nearly half of Quetta's cinema houses facing closure by 2010.&lt;ref name="Mastoi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/53273/cinemas-in-quetta-face-extinction/|title=Cinemas in Quetta face extinction|work=The Express Tribune|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=27 August 2016|first=Irshad|last=Mastoi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of films via Blu-rays, DVDs, VCRs and cable networks has also hampered the cinema-going trend.&lt;ref name="Mastoi"/&gt;

In recent years, a younger generation of Baloch filmmakers has emerged in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Karachi]], as part of the new wave of Pakistani cinema.

In the modern era lending books largely happens by Public Libraries. Generally worldwide [[public libraries]] are [[non-profit organizations]] offering book lending services free to their patrons and are generally funded through taxes and donations or by the state.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grants &amp; Related Programs - State Aid to Public Libraries|url = http://mblc.state.ma.us/grants/state_aid/|website = mblc.state.ma.us|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Appropriations {{!}} Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues|url = http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/libraryfunding|website = www.ala.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are accessible to general public and are run by civil servants, state employees, or volunteers.

Besides the public libraries, private libraries also provide lending services, and are usually run by individuals, associations, or by corporate organizations and universities. [[Private libraries]] usually require a subscription or membership to the library (paid or unpaid) and provide services specific to the organization, area or university.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

==Book rentals==
Historically before the [[industrial revolution]], books were too expensive for commoners to buy, and there were businesses which made profit by renting out books for a fee. ''[[Kashi-hon]]'' in [[Japan]] was one of such businesses. In modern era in developing and developed nations, for-profit book rental services have started to lend physical [[books]], [[audiobook]] CDs, e-books, and audiobook MP3s through stores and/or by an online (website) interface after popularization of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)|url = http://www.w3.org/|website = www.w3.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most book rental companies provide books with doorstep delivery using logistic services. Following the popular [[Netflix]] model for video rental, many book companies have applied features such as unlimited rentals, free shipping, and no late fees to their book distribution services.

== Book rental models ==

=== Based on rental method ===
Based on the rental method the book rental companies can be categorized into two subgroups:
# Book rental companies having a subscription-based models where a monthly or periodic subscription fee is charged and members can rent a number of books based on the subscription. 
# Book rental companies taking a fraction of book cost as rent. This is the most prevalent model in textbook and college book renting.

=== Based on type of book rented ===
Based on the type of books that the book rental service rents following classification can be done:
# Physical or Printed Books. The category can further be subdivided into 
## Companies primarily renting novels, fiction and story books. 
# E-book renters. Many companies renting physical books also rent e-books. Since e-book rental distribution rights are totally different from physical books most of the smaller companies are not able to rent e-books for standard publishers like [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Prentice Hall]], [[Cengage Learning|Cengage]] etc due to high license fees that needs to be paid for rental rights.

'''Canadian Artists' Representation/{{lang|fr|Le Front des artistes canadiens}}''' ('''CARFAC''') is a [[non-profit corporation]] that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists.

The mandate of CARFAC is to promote the visual arts in Canada, to promote a socio-economic climate that is conducive to the production of visual arts in Canada, and to conduct research and engage in public education for these purposes.

The organization's active involvement in advocacy, [[lobbying]], research and public education on behalf of artists in Canada has defined CARFAC as an integral representative body for artists across the country.

CARFAC was established by artists in 1968 and has been certified by the federal Status of the Artist legislation. CARFAC is guided by an active Board, elected by the membership.

==Jack Chambers and the Foundation of CARFAC==
In the early fall of 1967, the National Gallery of Canada wrote to many Canadian artists regarding the compilation of 2000 slides for a documentation library for the gallery using slides of the exhibit "300 Years of Canadian Art". The letters requested the artist's permission to reproduce their artwork in slide images; however, the letters also indicated that if the artist's permission was not received in time, the project would continue with their assumed support.

The letters implied that it was unnecessary for the artists to ask for royalty fees for the reproduction of their work because the project was educational in nature. This was a common claim used by galleries throughout the country in order to reproduce artists' works without having to pay to do so.

[[Jack Chambers (artist)|Jack Chambers]], a painter from London, Ontario, received one of these letters and replied to the National Gallery of Canada with a request for fair treatment for the artists. Jack Chambers advocated that it was absurd to exclude artists from payment for their work and the reproduction of it within an economic climate where it is socially acknowledged that payment is granted for services rendered. He pointed out that the gallery would make a profit from the reproduction of his work, even as an educational product, and thus asked to be compensated for his work. He sent his reply the National Gallery and forwarded his reply to 130 Canadian artists who also participated in the exhibit, encouraging them to reply in kind.

Because of the pressure from the artist's letters, the slide project was cancelled. Also from the letters, the foundations of CARFAC began to emerge.

Jack Chambers remained heavily involved in CARFAC during its formative years. However, on April 13, 1978 Jack Chambers died from Leukemia. In tribute to the organization's founder, the Jack Chambers Memorial Foundation for Research and Educational Development Projects to Benefit Canadian Visual Artists was formed.

==The origin of Canadian Artists' Fees==
In 1968 Canadian Artists' Representation (CAR) was officially founded. Spearheaded by Jack Chambers as National Representative, the collective of artists began to demand the recognition of artists' [[copyright]].

CAR began issuing minimum Copyright Fee Schedules which suggested how much artists should be paid when their art is exhibited or reproduced. The first suggested fee schedule was sent around to galleries in 1968. Previous to that, most galleries in Canada did not pay rental exhibition fees to the artists at all.

According to Jack Chambers in several interviews, the first fee schedule was met with great disbelief and hostility. Immediately, some galleries supported artists' rights and began paying fees but there were many who refused to abide by the CAR fee schedule. However, as a result of CAR's announcement in its newsletter in 1971 that its members would boycott all non-fee paying galleries, more galleries began paying fees to artists.

==CARFAC's role in amending Canadian copyright legislation==
CARFAC was instrumental in the creation of artist-centered copyright legislation.

In 1988 CARFAC's lobbying with other similar arts organizations resulted in an amendment to the Canadian Copyright Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-42).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The amendment recognized artists as the primary producers of culture, and gave artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees.

In 1990, once the amendments to the Copyright Act were approved, the Canadian Artists' Representation Copyright Collective (CARCC) was established as a subsidiary organization of CARFAC. It serves as a copyright collective to license and administer copyright for visual and media artists in Canada.

==CARFAC and the exhibition right==
CARFAC has worked hard to achieve the Exhibition Right for all visual artists in Canada.  The Exhibition Right is the right for artists to present a work of visual art other than a map, chart, or plan at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than for sale or hire. CARFAC defends of the rights of artists to be paid to exhibit their works publicly rather than being forced to exhibit without pay if they desire exposure.

==CARFAC membership==
The CARFAC voting membership includes practicing professional artists. The non-voting associate members include students, museums and [[art gallery|art galleries]], educational institutions, and other individuals and institutions with an interest in the visual arts.

[[File:Mirage III cockpit MG 1348.JPG|thumb|Central forward area of the [[Mirage III]] cockpit, showing a centre stick.]]

A '''centre stick''' (or '''center stick''' in the United States), or simply '''control stick''' is an aircraft [[cockpit]] arrangement where the control column (or [[joystick]]) is located in the center of the cockpit between the [[Aviator|pilot]]'s legs. Since the throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot, the right hand is used for the stick, although left-hand or both-hands operation is possible if required.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 132. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre stick is a part of an aircraft's [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], and is typically linked to its [[aileron]]s and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]]s, or alternatively to its [[elevon]]s, by control rods or control cables on basic aircraft. On heavier, faster, more advanced aircraft the centre stick may also control power-assist modules.  Modern aircraft centre sticks are also usually equipped with a number of electrical control switches within easy finger reach, in order to reduce the pilot's workload.

The centre stick is used in many military fighter jets such as [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and the [[Mirage III]], but also in [[light aircraft]] such as [[Piper Cub]]s and the [[Diamond Aircraft]] line of products such as the [[DA20]], [[DA40]] and [[DA42]].

This arrangement contrasts with the more recently developed "[[side-stick]]" which is used in such military fighter jets as the [[F-16]], the [[F-35 Lightning II]] and [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and also on civil aircraft such as the [[Airbus A320]].

== History ==

The centre stick originated at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1900 [[Wilhelm Kress]] of [[Austria]] developed a control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent. Instead, a patent was awarded to the [[France|French]] aviator, [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] who applied for it in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connections (TV series)|''Connections'']], Episode 6 Part 5 of 5 (1976).&lt;br&gt;Also: {{cite book | last = Burke | first = James | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-316-11681-5 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Chypre''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|pron}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʃipχ|}}) is the name of a family (or ''concept'') of [[perfume]]s that are characterised by an accord composed of [[citrus]] top[[note (perfumery)|note]]s, a middle centered on cistus [[labdanum]], and a mossy-animalic set of basenotes derived from [[oakmoss]]. Chypre perfumes fall into numerous classes according to their modifier notes, which include but are not limited to leather, florals, fruits, and [[amber]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chypre" Microsoft Encarta Dictionary, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cyprus by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for [[Cyprus]]]]
The term ''chypre'' is [[French language|French]] for the island of [[Cyprus]]. Its connection to perfumery originated with the first composition to feature the bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss accord, [[François Coty]]'s 1917 perfume ''Chypre'' (now preserved at the [[Osmothèque]]), whose name was inspired by the fact that its raw materials came predominantly from Mediterranean countries.&lt;ref&gt;Turin, Luca, and Tania Sanchez. The Little Book of Perfumes: The 100 Classics. London: Profile, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although perfumes in a similar style had already been created in the 19th century, ''Chypre'' was so influential that it inspired many descendants, becoming the progenitor of a whole family of related fragrances sharing the same basic accord, which came to be known as chypres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810105829/http://www.museesdegrasse.com/MIP/fla_ang/histo_gXIX.shtml |date=2007-08-10 }}, the International Perfume Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre concept is characterised by the contrast between the fresh citrus accord and the woody-[[Oak moss|oakmoss]] base; often [[patchouli]] is considered an indispensable element as well.&lt;ref&gt;H&amp;R Fragrance Guide/Duftatlas/Atlas Olfactif, Quensen &amp; Oudras Verlag, Lamspringe, 2000, p. 14, {{ISBN|3-922805-69-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chypre accord is used in both male and female perfumery.

==In popular culture==
A notable literary reference to chypre is contained in the novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' by [[Dashiell Hammett]] (Knopf, 1929), in which the character Joel Cairo is described as carrying a chypre-scented handkerchief as part of his homosexual persona. Raymond Chandler's ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' (Knopf, 1943) also mentions a chypre-scented, monogrammed handkerchief. [[Brave New World]] written by [[Aldous Huxley]] in 1932, the main female character, Lenina Crowne, “dabbled herself with chypre” after drying off from a bath.

==Notable examples==
One of the most popular chypre perfumes was the original Miss Dior, a floral chypre launched by Christian Dior in 1947. The formula was later changed, likely due to issues with the ingredient oakmoss.  Since the mid-1980s, [[Karl Lagerfeld]] cologne, orange in color, called "Lagerfeld" is a modern chypre scent for both men and women.

In the 1950s and 60s in the USSR, "ШИПР" Shipr, became a popular men's fragrance. Today ШИПР is still available in Russian cosmetic stores and it is a popular scent among women.

==Style==
Modern chypre perfumes have various connotations such as floral, fruity, green, woody-aromatic, leathery, and animalic notes, but can easily be recognized by their "warm" and "mossy-woody" base which contrasts the fresh citrus top, and a certain bitterness in the dry-down from the oak moss and patchouli. The accord consists of:
*''Citrus'': singular or blends of [[bergamot orange|Bergamot]], [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]], [[Lemon]] or [[Neroli]]
*''[[Oakmoss]]'': mossy and woody
*''[[Patchouli]]'': camphoraceous and woody
*''[[Musk]]'': sweet, powdery, and animalic. Usually [[Synthetic musk|synthetic]] in modern times.

The composition is usually enhanced with a floral component through [[rose]] and [[jasmine]] oil.

Animalic notes such as [[civet]] can be added to this accord to provide richness, but are less popular in modern [[perfumery]]. The most common modifiers to this basic accord include [[patchouli]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[vetiver]], [[ambergris]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Rock rose|labdanum]] resin.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the chypre family from [http://www.museesdegrasse.com/mip/fla_ang/crea_classif.shtml#chypre Musées de Grasse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-families of chypre==
The chypre fragrances generally fit into the Oriental and Woody family of [[fragrance wheel]] classification. They can also be classified into several styles:
*Leather and/or animalic chypres, such as ''Bandit'' by [[Robert Piguet]] (1944), ''[[Cabochard]]'' by [[Grès]] (1959), and ''[[Azurée]]'' (1969) by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]].
*Floral chypres, such as ''Knowing'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1988.
*Fruity chypres, such as ''Femme'' by [[Rochas]], 1944, ''[[Mitsouko]]'' by [[Guerlain]], 1917, and ''Y'' by [[Yves Saint-Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], 1964.
*Green chypres, such as ''Givenchy III'' by [[Givenchy]] (1970), ''Aliage'' by [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]], 1972 and ''Cuvée Spéciale'' by [[Charvet Place Vendôme|Charvet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charvet Cuvee Speciale |work=basenotes|url=http://www.basenotes.net/threads/262131-Charvet-Cuvee-Speciale|accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Woody-aromatic chypres, such as ''Aromatics Elixir'' by [[Clinique]], 1972.
*Fresh-citric chypres, such as ''[[CK One]]'' by [[Calvin Klein]], 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">A '''cross-genre''' (or '''hybrid genre''') is a [[literary genre|genre]] in [[fiction]] that blends themes and elements from two or more different genres. As opposed to the (literary and political) conservatism of most [[genre fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; cross-genre writing offers opportunities for opening up debates and stimulating discussion.

Such hybrid genres are not new but a longstanding element in the fictional process: perhaps the most famous example is [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', with its blend of poetry, prose, and engravings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singer/W. Walker, ''Bending Genre'' (2013) p. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary literature [[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s trilogy [[Poena Damni]] ([[Z213: Exit]], [[With the people from the bridge]], [[The First Death]]) combines fictional prose with drama and poetry in a multilayered narrative developing through the different characters of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/reviews-march/ |title=Reviews: Z213: Exit by Dimitris Lyacos &amp;#124; Write From Wrong Literary Magazine |publisher=Writefromwrongmag.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic discontinuites==
[[Fredric Jameson]] has highlighted the progressive elements in Third World Literature that defies genre expectations such as [[Xala (novel)|Xala]]; and in [[science fiction]] like ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' with its exploration of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weekes eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 334 and p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Koontz]] considers himself  a cross-genre writer, not a [[Horror fiction|horror]] writer: “I write cross-genre books-suspense mixed with love story, with humor, sometimes with two tablespoons of science fiction, sometimes with a pinch of horror, sometimes with a sprinkle of paprika...”&lt;ref&gt;Koontz, Dean. "Afterword, Lightening", G.P. Putnam's Sons hardcover edition, January 1988. Berkley Publishing Group, mass market edition, May 1989. p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Eclogue of Theodulus''''' was a [[Latin]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] dialogue, which became a standard school text of the [[Middle Ages]]. Scholarship generally dates it to the 10th century, though earlier dates are also given.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Pepin, ''An English Translation of the Auctores Octo: A Medieval Reader'', Mediaeval Studies 12 (The Edwin Mellen Press, 1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;25–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is attributed to [[Gottschalk of Orbais]], and in fact the name ''Theodolus'' is the Greek translation of ''Gottschalk'' (God's slave). The poem is an argument between Alithia (truth) and Pseustis (falsehood}, with Phronesis (reason), acting as referee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9yIXeZNrDHQC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=%22Eclogue+of+Theodulus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njRybYyz5m&amp;sig=KUydE-ckeis9_jlZ1rh3zrVDt9c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YfxITeXNLsW44garxKyqDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eclogue%20of%20Theodulus%22&amp;f=false The Cambridge Medieval History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imamzadeh Mausoleum''' is mosque on the Imamli street in the central part of the city of [[Shamakhi]]. It is the oldest mosque in the territory of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]. The mosque was registered by [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan Republic]] as a historical and cultural monument of the country.

==History==

[[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] mentioned in his famous Gulistani-Iram work in 1841: ''"In many ways, the ruins of the village and the high-ranking three imamzadehs in the cities of Shamakhi, Ganja and Barda, Imamzadeh in the Bulbule village show that this country has always been the homeland of the religious elders"''&lt;ref&gt;Gulistani-Iram, p.35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

The mausoleum was built on the tomb of one of the sons of the fourth imam, Zeynalabdin – Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris. Also, Seyid Mirmehdi Agha Seyidali oghlu, who had worked here as [[akhund]] for a long time, was buried here in 1911. The mosque was built in 1370 and was reconstructed on the basis of project of Zivar bey Ahmadbayov in 1910–1917. Generally, the mosque is supposed to be built five times. In 1991 it was restored under leadership of akhund, Haji Elshan Rustamov. It is possible that 400 people can worship here at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;K.Abdullayev "Azərbaycanda müqəddəs ziyarətgahlar", Bakı, "Çinar-Çap", 2007, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosque complex consists of three parts – pilgrimage (Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris was buried there), place of worship and hoseyniyeh.

In [[mathematics]], specifically in the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]], an '''irreducible representation''' &lt;math&gt;(\rho, V)&lt;/math&gt; or '''irrep''' of an algebraic structure &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero representation that has no proper subrepresentation &lt;math&gt;(\rho|_W,W), W \subset V&lt;/math&gt; closed under the action of &lt;math&gt;\{ \rho(a) : a\in A \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every finite-dimensional [[unitary representation]] on a [[Hermitian]]{{clarify|pre-text=[[Sesquilinear form]] or|date=July 2016}} vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the [[direct sum]] of irreducible representations. As irreducible representations are always '''indecomposable''' (i.e. cannot be decomposed further into a direct sum of representations), these terms are often confused; however, in general there are many reducible but indecomposable representations, such as the two-dimensional representation of the real numbers acting by upper triangular unipotent matrices.

==History==

Group representation theory was generalized by [[Richard Brauer]] from the 1940s to give [[modular representation theory]], in which the matrix operators act on a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of arbitrary [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]], rather than a vector space over the field of [[real number]]s or over the field of [[complex number]]s.  The structure analogous to an irreducible representation in the resulting theory is a [[simple module]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Overview==

{{details|Group representation}}

Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a representation i.e. a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\rho: G\to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. If we pick a basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a function (a homomorphism) from a group into a set of invertible matrices and in this context is called a '''matrix representation'''. However, it simplifies things greatly if we think of the space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; without a basis.

A [[linear subspace]] &lt;math&gt;W\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is called '''&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant''' if &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)w\in W&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; w\in W&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant subspace &lt;math&gt;W\subset V&lt;/math&gt; is known as a '''subrepresentation'''. A representation &lt;math&gt;\rho: G\to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''irreducible''' if it has only [[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] subrepresentations (all representations can form a subrepresentation with the trivial &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant subspaces, e.g. the whole vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and [[zero vector space|{0}]]). If there is a proper non-trivial invariant subspace, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''reducible'''.

===Notation and terminology of group representations===

Group elements can be represented by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], although the term "represented" has a specific and precise meaning in this context. A representation of a group is a mapping from the group elements to the [[general linear group]] of matrices. As notation, let {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''...}} denote elements of a group {{math|''G''}} with group product signified without any symbol, so {{math|''ab''}} is the group product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and is also an element of {{math|''G''}}, and let representations be indicated by {{math|''D''}}. The '''representation of ''a''''' is written

:&lt;math&gt;D(a) = \begin{pmatrix}
D(a)_{11} &amp; D(a)_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{1n} \\
D(a)_{21} &amp; D(a)_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
D(a)_{n1} &amp; D(a)_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; D(a)_{nn} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of group representations, the representation of a group product is translated into [[matrix multiplication]] of the representations:

:&lt;math&gt;D(ab) = D(a)D(b) &lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''e''}} is the [[identity element]] of the group (so that {{math|''ae'' {{=}} ''ea'' {{=}} ''a''}}, etc.), then {{math|''D''(''e'')}} is an [[identity matrix]], or identically a block matrix of identity matrices, since we must have

:&lt;math&gt;D(ea) = D(ae) = D(a)D(e) = D(e)D(a) = D(a) &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for all other group elements. The last two staments correspond to the requirement that {{math|''D''}} is a [[group homomorphism]].

===Decomposable and Indecomposable representations===

A representation is decomposable if a [[Matrix similarity|similar matrix]] {{math|''P''}} can be found for the [[matrix similarity|similarity transformation]]:&lt;ref name="Wigner p 73"&gt;{{cite book| author=E.P. Wigner|title=Group theory and its application to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra|year=1959|series=Pure and applied physics|page=73|publisher=Academic press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D'(a) \equiv P^{-1} D(a) P&lt;/math&gt;

which [[matrix diagonalization|diagonalizes]] every matrix in the representation into the same pattern of [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] [[block matrix|block]]s&amp;nbsp;– each of the blocks are representation of the group independent of each other. The representations {{math|''D''(''a'')}} and {{math|''D'''(''a'')}} are said to be '''equivalent representations'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= W.K. Tung|title=Group Theory in Physics|page=32|publisher=World Scientific|year=1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O89tgpOBO04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=group+theory+in+physics#v=onepage&amp;q=group%20theory%20in%20physics&amp;f=false|isbn=978-997-1966-560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representation can be decomposed into a [[direct sum of matrices|direct sum of ''k'' matrices]]:

:&lt;math&gt; D'(a) = P^{-1} D(a) P = \begin{pmatrix} 
D^{(1)}(a) &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; D^{(2)}(a) &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; D^{(k)}(a) \\
\end{pmatrix} = D^{(1)}(a) \oplus D^{(2)}(a) \oplus \cdots \oplus D^{(k)}(a) &lt;/math&gt;

so {{math|''D''(''a'')}} is '''decomposable''', and it is customary to label the decomposed matrices by a superscript in brackets, as in {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'')}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''k''}}, although some authors just write the numerical label without parantheses.

The dimension of {{math|''D''(''a'')}} is the sum of the dimensions of the blocks:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{dim}[D(a)] = \mathrm{dim}[D^{(1)}(a)] + \mathrm{dim}[D^{(2)}(a)] + \ldots + \mathrm{dim}[D^{(k)}(a)] &lt;/math&gt;

If this is not possible, i.e. {{math|''k''{{=}}1}}, then the representation is indecomposable.&lt;ref name="Wigner p 73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tung 33"&gt;{{cite book|author= W.K. Tung|title=Group Theory in Physics
|page=33|publisher=World Scientific|year=1985|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O89tgpOBO04C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=group+theory+in+physics#v=onepage&amp;q=group%20theory%20in%20physics&amp;f=false|isbn=978-997-1966-560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Irreducible Representations==

===Trivial Representation===
All groups &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have a one-dimensional, irreducible trivial representation. More generally, any one-dimensional representation is irreducible by virtue of having no proper nontrivial subspaces.

===Irreducible Complex Representations===

The irreducible complex representations of a finite group G can be characterized using results from [[character theory]]. In particular, all such representations decompose as a direct sum of irreps, and the number of irreps of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Serre"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre| first=Jean-Pierre| last= Serre| title=Linear Representations of Finite Groups | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1977 | isbn=978-0387901909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The irreducible complex representations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are exactly given by the maps &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[root of unity]].
* Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional complex representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; with basis &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\}^n_{i=1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as a direct sum of the irreps &lt;math&gt;V_{triv} = \mathbb{C}( \sum^n_{i=1} v_i)&lt;/math&gt; and the orthogonal subspace given by:
::&lt;math&gt;V_{std} = \{ \sum^n_{i=1} a_i v_i : a_i \in \mathbb{C},  \sum^n_{i=1} a_i = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
:The former irrep is one-dimensional and isomorphic to the trivial representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional and is known as the standard representation of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Serre"/&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. The [[regular representation]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the free complex vector space on the basis &lt;math&gt;\{e_g\}_{g \in G}&lt;/math&gt; with the group action &lt;math&gt;g \cdot e_{g'} = e_{gg'}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}G&lt;/math&gt;. All irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; appear in the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}G&lt;/math&gt; as a direct sum of irreps.

==Applications in theoretical physics and chemistry==

{{see also|Symmetry in quantum mechanics|Jahn–Teller effect}}

In [[quantum physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], each set of [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] comprises a vector space {{mvar|V}} for a representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, a "multiplet", best studied through reduction to its irreducible parts.  Identifying the irreducible representations therefore allows one to label the states, predict how they will [[energy level splitting|split]] under perturbations;  or transition to other states in {{mvar|V}}. Thus, in quantum mechanics, irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system partially or completely label the energy levels of the system, allowing the [[selection rule]]s to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry|title=A Dictionary of Chemistry, Answers.com|edition=6th|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/irreducible-representation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lorentz group===

{{main|Representation theory of the Lorentz group}}

The irreps of {{math|''D''('''K''')}} and {{math|''D''('''J''')}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the generator of rotations and {{math|'''K'''}} the generator of boosts, can be used to build to spin representations of the Lorentz group, because they are related to the spin matrices of quantum mechanics. This allows them to derive [[relativistic wave equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">'''Isaac Mendes Belisario''' (1795 – 1849) was a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] artist of [[History of the Jews in Jamaica|Jewish]] descent. He was active in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] around the time of the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|Emancipation]]. His painting and printing work provides an eye-witness document of life in Jamaica of the time. He is one of the earliest artists who took a Jamaica-centric approach to the island's culture. His portfolio includes the lithograph ''Sketches of Character, In Illustration of the Habits, Occupation, and Costume of the Negro Population in the Island of Jamaica'', which was published in collaboration with the lithographer [[Adolphe Duperly]] in 1837–38, documents activities of the former slaves immediately after the emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Barringer]], Gillian Forrester, Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz (eds), ''Art and Emancipation in Jamaica: Belisario and his Worlds'', Yale Center for British Art, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prints are the earliest visual representation of the masquerade of [[John Canoe]].

{{History of Italy}}

The '''Italian Renaissance''' ({{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}) was a period of [[European history]] that began in [[Italy]] in the 14th century ([[Trecento]]) and lasted until the 17th century ([[Seicento]]), marking the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to [[Modernity]]. The French word ''renaissance'' (''Rinascimento'' in Italian) means "Rebirth" and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in [[classical antiquity]] after the centuries labeled the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] by [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]]. The Renaissance author [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "Rebirth" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century, after the works of scholars such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]].

The European Renaissance began in [[Tuscany]] ([[Central Italy]]), and was centred in the city of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Florence, one of the several [[city-states]] of the peninsula, rose to economic prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and laying down the groundwork for [[capitalism]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Renaissance later spread to [[Venice]], heart of a [[Venetian Empire|mediterranean empire]] and in control of the trade routes with the east since the participation in the [[crusades]] and the voyages of [[Marco Polo]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together and provided [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the [[Papal States]] and [[Rome]], largely rebuilt by Humanist and [[Renaissance pope]]s (such as [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]), who were frequently involved in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Italian politics]], in [[Treaty of Tordesillas|arbitrating disputes]] between competing colonial powers and in [[Counter-Reformation|opposing]] the [[Reformation]].

The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in [[Italian Renaissance painting|painting]], [[Italian Renaissance architecture|architecture]], [[Italian Renaissance sculpture|sculpture]], [[Italian Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]] and [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]]. Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century, during the [[Peace of Lodi]] (1454-1494) agreed between Italian states. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]] (1494-1559). However, the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance endured and spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Italian explorers from the [[maritime republics]] served under the auspices of European monarchs, ushering the Age of discovery. The most famous among them are [[Christopher Columbus]] who served for Spain, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] for France, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] for Portugal, and [[John Cabot]] for England. Italian universities attracted [[polymaths]] and scholars such as [[Copernicus]], [[Vesalius]], [[Galileo]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], playing a key role in the [[scientific revolution]]. Various events and dates of the 17th century, such as the conclusion of the [[European Wars of Religion]] in 1648, have been proposed for the end of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=SvYACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=peace+of+westphalia+marks+the+end+of+the+Renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA3ICuifLVAhXKCsAKHRbbBCgQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=peace%20of%20westphalia%20marks%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Renaissance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of [[Renaissance literature]] usually begin with the three great poets of the 14th century: [[Dante Alighieri]] (''[[Divine Comedy]]''), [[Petrarch]] (''[[Canzoniere]]'') and [[Boccaccio]] (''[[Decameron]]''). Famous vernacular poets of the Renaissance include the renaissance epic authors [[Luigi Pulci]] (author of ''[[Morgante]]''), [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] (''[[Orlando Innamorato]]''), [[Ludovico Ariosto]] (''[[Orlando Furioso]]'') and [[Torquato Tasso]] (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''). 15th-century writers such as the poet [[Poliziano]] and the Platonist philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]] laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady in ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', while [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "''la verità effettuale della cosa''"—the actual truth of things—in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, in humanistic style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Historians of the period include Machiavelli himself, his friend and critic [[Francesco Guicciardini]] and [[Giovanni Botero]] (''[[The Reason of State]]''). The Aldine Press, founded by the printer [[Aldo Manuzio]], active in Venice, developed [[Italic type]] and portable printed books that could be carried in one's pocket, as well as being the first to publish editions of books in Ancient Greek. Venice also became the birthplace of the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].

[[Italian Renaissance art]] exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Titian]]. The same is true for [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], as practiced by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Bramante]]. Their works include, to name only a few, the [[Florence Cathedral]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in Rimini, as well as [[Renaissance architecture|several private residences]]. The musical era of the Italian Renaissance was defined by the [[Roman School]] and later by the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] and the birth of [[Opera]] in Florence. In [[Modern philosophy#Modern Western philosophy|philosophy]], thinkers such as Galileo, Machiavelli, [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], emphasized [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[humanism]], thus rejecting dogma and [[scholasticism]].

==Origins and background==
===Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages===
By the [[Late Middle Ages]] (circa 1300 onward), [[Latium]], the former heartland of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[southern Italy]] were generally poorer than the North. [[Rome]] was a city of ancient ruins, and the [[Papal States]] were loosely administered, and vulnerable to external interference such as that of France, and later Spain. The Papacy was affronted when the [[Avignon Papacy]] was created in southern France as a consequence of pressure from [[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair]] of France. In the south, [[Sicily]] had for some time been under foreign domination, [[History of Islam in southern Italy|by the Arabs]] and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|then the Normans]]. Sicily had prospered for 150 years during the [[Emirate of Sicily]] and later for two centuries during the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Hohenstaufen Kingdom]], but had declined by the late Middle Ages.

In contrast, Northern and Central Italy had become far more prosperous, and it has been calculated that the region was among the richest of [[Europe]]. The [[Crusades]] had built lasting trade links to the [[Levant]], and the [[Fourth Crusade]] had done much to destroy the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman Empire]] as a commercial rival to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the [[Arab World|Arab lands]] and onward to the ports of [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], and [[Venice]]. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland [[city-state]]s profited from the rich agricultural land of the [[Po River|Po]] valley. From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the [[Champagne fairs]], land and river trade routes brought goods such as [[wool]], [[wheat]], and [[precious metal]]s into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from [[Egypt]] to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture. Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy,  mainly due to its woolen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade [[guild]], the ''[[Arte della Lana]]''. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[dye]]s from the east were used to make high quality textiles.

The Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The
[[Transmission of the Classics|recovery of lost Greek classics]] (and, to a lesser extent, Arab advancements on them) following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Siege of Constantinople|conquest of the Byzantine heartlands]], revitalized [[medieval philosophy]] in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], just as the [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|refugee Byzantine scholars]] who migrated to Italy during and following the Turkish conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] between the 12th and 15th centuries were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created [[Academy|academies]] in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered [[Tacitus]] and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of [[Vitruvius]] meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel the achievements of the Ancients, like [[Apelles]], of whom they read.

===Thirteenth-century===
In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the [[Hanseatic League]] of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The  [[Italian city-states|city-states of Italy]] expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; apart from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with [[double-entry book-keeping]], [[joint stock companies]], an international [[banking]] system, a systematized [[foreign exchange market]], [[insurance]], and [[government debt]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold [[Italian coin florin|florin]] became the main currency of international trade.

The new mercantile governing class, who gained their position through financial skill, adapted to their purposes the [[feudal]] aristocratic model that had dominated Europe in the Middle Ages. A feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the [[Medieval commune|urban communes]] which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the [[landed nobility]] was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the High Medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics. The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This atmosphere of assumed luxury of the time created a need for the creation of visual symbols of wealth, an important way to show a family’s affluence and taste.

This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those that grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to [[Jacques Coeur]] in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against [[usury]], and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourteenth-century collapse===
The 14th century saw a series of catastrophes that caused the European economy to go into recession. The [[Medieval Warm Period]] was ending as the transition to the [[Little Ice Age]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 97; see also Andrew B. Appleby's "Epidemics and Famine in the Little Ice Age." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History.'' Vol. 10 No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in climate saw agricultural output decline significantly, leading to repeated [[famine]]s, exacerbated by the rapid population growth of the earlier era. The [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France disrupted trade throughout northwest Europe, most notably when, in 1345, King [[Edward III of England]] repudiated his debts, contributing to the collapse of the two largest Florentine banks, those of the [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]]. In the east, war was also disrupting trade routes, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] began to expand throughout the region. Most devastating, though, was the [[Black Death]] that decimated the populations of the densely populated cities of Northern Italy and returned at intervals thereafter. Florence, for instance, which had a pre-plague population of 45,000 decreased over the next 47 years by 25–50%.&lt;ref&gt;Olea, Ricardo A, Christakos, George, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 "Duration of Urban Mortality for the 14th-Century Black Death Epidemic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206150835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''Human Biology'',  Jun 2005. The population level of Florence is controversial see also Ziegler (1969, pp. 51-52), Chandler 1987, pp. 16-18, and Gottfried 1983, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread disorder followed, including a revolt of Florentine textile workers, the ''[[ciompi]]'', in 1378.

It was during this period of instability that the Renaissance authors such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] lived, and the first stirrings of Renaissance art were to be seen, notably in the realism of [[Giotto]]. Paradoxically, some of these disasters would help establish the Renaissance. The [[Black Death]] wiped out a third of Europe's population. The resulting labour shortage increased wages and the reduced population was therefore much wealthier, better fed, and, significantly, had more surplus money to spend on luxury goods.  As incidences of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] began to decline in the early 15th century, Europe's devastated population once again began to grow.  The new demand for products and services also helped create a growing class of [[bankers]], merchants, and skilled [[artisan]]s.  The horrors of the Black Death and the seeming inability of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] to provide relief would contribute to a decline of church influence. Additionally, the collapse of the [[Compagnia dei Bardi|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi Bank|Peruzzi]] banks would open the way for the [[Medici]] to rise to prominence in Florence. [[Roberto Sabatino Lopez]] argues that the economic collapse was a crucial cause of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Robert Sabatino. "Hard Times and Investment in Culture."&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in a more prosperous era, businessmen would have quickly reinvested their earnings in order to make more money in a climate favourable to investment. However, in the leaner years of the 14th century, the wealthy found few promising investment opportunities for their earnings and instead chose to spend more on culture and art.

Another popular explanation for the Italian Renaissance is the thesis, first advanced by historian [[Hans Baron]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Hans. "The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance". Princeton University Press, March 1, 1966. {{ISBN|0-691-00752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that states that the primary impetus of the early Renaissance was the long-running series of [[Italian Wars|wars]] between Florence and Milan. By the late 14th century, Milan had become a centralized monarchy under the control of the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] family. [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], who ruled the city from 1378 to 1402, was renowned both for his cruelty and for his abilities, and set about building an empire in Northern Italy. He launched a long series of wars, with Milan steadily conquering neighbouring states and defeating the various coalitions led by Florence that sought in vain to halt the advance. This culminated in the 1402 siege of Florence, when it looked as though the city was doomed to fall, before Giangaleazzo suddenly died and his empire collapsed.

Baron's thesis suggests that during these long wars, the leading figures of Florence rallied the people by presenting the war as one between the free republic and a despotic monarchy, between the ideals of the Greek and Roman Republics and those of the Roman Empire and Medieval kingdoms. For Baron, the most important figure in crafting this ideology was [[Leonardo Bruni]]. This time of crisis in Florence was the period when the most influential figures of the early Renaissance were coming of age, such as [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Masolino]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Inculcated with this republican ideology they later went on to advocate republican ideas that were to have an enormous impact on the Renaissance.

{{Main|Italian Wars}}
[[File:Piero, ritratto di sigismondo malatesta.jpg|thumb|[[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] (1417–1468), lord of [[Rimini]], by [[Piero della Francesca]]. Malatesta was a capable ''[[condottiere]]'', following the tradition of his family. He was hired by the [[Venice|Venetians]] to fight against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] (unsuccessfully) in 1465, and was patron of [[Leone Battista Alberti]], whose ''[[Tempio Malatestiano]]'' at Rimini is one of the first entirely classical buildings of the Renaissance.]]
Northern Italy and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the most powerful being [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Genoa]], [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]], [[Verona]] and [[Venice]].  High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long-running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s and [[Ghibelline]]s.  Warfare between the states was common, invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. Renaissance politics developed from this background. Since the 13th century, as armies became primarily composed of [[mercenaries]], prosperous city-states could field considerable forces, despite their low populations. In the course of the 15th century, the most powerful city-states annexed their smaller neighbors. Florence took [[Pisa]] in 1406, Venice captured [[Padua]] and [[Verona]], while the [[Duchy of Milan]] annexed a number of nearby areas including [[Pavia]] and [[Parma]].

The first part of the Renaissance saw almost constant warfare on land and sea as the city-states vied for preeminence.  On land, these wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.  The mercenaries were not willing to risk their lives unduly, and war became one largely of sieges and maneuvering, occasioning few pitched battles. It was also in the interest of mercenaries on both sides to prolong any conflict, to continue their employment.  Mercenaries were also a constant threat to their employers; if not paid, they often turned on their patron.  If it became obvious that a state was entirely dependent on mercenaries, the temptation was great for the mercenaries to take over the running of it themselves—this occurred on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, Italian city-states sent many fleets out to do battle. The main contenders were Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, but after a long conflict the Genoese succeeded in reducing Pisa.  Venice proved to be a more powerful adversary, and with the decline of Genoese power during the 15th century Venice became pre-eminent on the seas. In response to threats from the landward side, from the early 15th century Venice developed an increased interest in controlling the ''terrafirma'' as the Venetian Renaissance opened.

On land, decades of fighting saw Florence, Milan and Venice emerge as the dominant players, and these three powers finally set aside their differences and agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries.  This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice's unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. In the beginning of the 15th century, adventurer and traders such as [[Niccolò Da Conti]] (1395–1469) traveled as far as [[Southeast Asia]] and back, bringing fresh knowledge on the state of the world, presaging further European voyages of exploration in the years to come.

===Florence under the Medici===
{{Main|House of Medici}}
Until the late 14th century, prior to the Medici, Florence's leading family were the [[House of Albizzi]]. In 1293 the Ordinances of Justice were enacted which effectively became the constitution of the republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bartlett, ''The Italian Renaissance'', Chapter 7, p.37, Volume II, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's numerous luxurious [[Palace#Italy|palazzi]] were becoming surrounded by [[townhouses]], built by the ever prospering merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutflorence.com/history-of-Florence.html |title=History of Florence |publisher=Aboutflorence.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, were bankrupted and so the city of Siena lost her status as the banking center of Europe to Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challengers of the Albizzi family were the [[Medici]]s, first under [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], later under his son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici]]. The Medici controlled the [[Medici bank]]—then Europe's largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Roger J. ''Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence ''. Artibus et Historiae, Volume 22, Edit 44, 2001. pp. 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, saw a pro-Medici [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the town's leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during the intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts, but were the unquestioned leaders.

Cosimo de' Medici was highly popular among the citizenry, mainly for bringing an era of stability and prosperity to the town. One of his most important accomplishments was negotiating the [[Peace of Lodi]] with [[Francesco Sforza]] ending the decades of war with Milan and bringing stability to much of Northern Italy. Cosimo was also an important patron of the arts, directly and indirectly, by the influential example he set.

Cosimo was succeeded by his sickly son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]], who died after five years in charge of the city. In 1469 the reins of power passed to Cosimo's twenty-one-year-old grandson [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], who would become known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent." Lorenzo was the first of the family to be educated from an early age in the humanist tradition and is best known as one of the Renaissance's most important patrons of the arts. Under Lorenzo, the Medici rule was formalized with the creation of a new [[Council of Seventy]], which Lorenzo headed. The republican institutions continued, but they lost all power. Lorenzo was less successful than his illustrious forebears in business, and the Medici commercial empire was slowly eroded. Lorenzo continued the alliance with Milan, but relations with the papacy soured, and in 1478, Papal agents allied with the [[Pazzi]] family in an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo. Although the plot failed, Lorenzo's young brother, [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]], was killed, and the failed assassination led to a war with the Papacy and was used as justification to further centralize power in Lorenzo's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread===
Renaissance ideals first spread from Florence to the neighbouring states of [[Tuscany]] such as [[Siena]] and [[Lucca]]. The Tuscan culture soon became the model for all the states of Northern Italy, and the Tuscan variety of Italian came to predominate throughout the region, especially in literature. In 1447 [[Francesco Sforza]] came to power in [[Milan]] and rapidly transformed that still medieval city into a major centre of art and learning that drew [[Leone Battista Alberti]]. [[Venice]], one of the wealthiest cities due to its control of the Adriatic Sea, also became a centre for Renaissance culture, especially architecture. Smaller courts brought Renaissance patronage to lesser cities, which developed their characteristic arts: [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]] under the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], and [[Urbino]] under [[Federico da Montefeltro]]. In [[Naples]], the Renaissance was ushered in under the patronage of [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] who conquered Naples in 1443 and encouraged artists like [[Francesco Laurana]] and [[Antonello da Messina]] and writers like the poet [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] and the humanist scholar [[Angelo Poliziano]].

In 1417 the Papacy returned to Rome, but that once imperial city remained poor and largely in ruins through the first years of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="rome"&gt;Burke 1999, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The great transformation began under [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became pontiff in 1447.  He launched a dramatic rebuilding effort that would eventually see much of the city renewed.  The humanist scholar Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini became [[Pope Pius II]] in 1458. As the papacy fell under the control of the wealthy families, such as the [[Medici]] and the [[Borgia]]s&lt;!--Valencia!--&gt; the spirit of Renaissance art and philosophy came to dominate the Vatican.  [[Pope Sixtus IV]] continued Nicholas' work, most famously ordering the construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]].  The popes also became increasingly secular rulers as the [[Papal States]] were forged into a centralized power by a series of "warrior popes".

The nature of the Renaissance also changed in the late 15th century.  The Renaissance ideal was fully adopted by the ruling classes and the aristocracy.  In the early Renaissance artists were seen as craftsmen with little prestige or recognition.  By the later Renaissance the top figures wielded great influence and could charge great fees.  A flourishing trade in Renaissance art developed.  While in the early Renaissance many of the leading artists were of lower- or middle-class origins, increasingly they became aristocrats.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

===Wider population===
As a cultural movement, the Italian Renaissance affected only a small part of the population. Italy was the most urbanized region of Europe, but three quarters of the people were still rural peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; For this section of the population, life remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic [[feudalism]] had never been prominent in Northern Italy, and most peasants worked on private farms or as [[sharecropper]]s.  Some scholars see a trend towards [[refeudalization]] in the later Renaissance as the urban elites turned themselves into landed aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation differed in the  cities. These were dominated by a commercial elite; as exclusive as the aristocracy of any Medieval kingdom.  This group became the main patrons of and audience for Renaissance culture.  Below them there was a large class of artisans and guild members who lived comfortable lives and had significant power in the republican governments.  This was in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe where artisans were firmly in the lower class.  Literate and educated, this group did participate in the Renaissance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest section of the urban population was the urban poor of semi-skilled workers and the unemployed.  Like the peasants, the Renaissance had little effect on them. Historians debate how easy it was to move between these groups during the Italian Renaissance. Examples of individuals who rose from humble beginnings can be instanced, but Burke notes two major studies in this area that have found that the data do not clearly demonstrate an increase in [[social mobility]]. Most historians feel that early in the Renaissance social mobility was quite high, but that it faded over the course of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality in society was very high.  An upper-class figure would control hundreds of times more income than a servant or labourer.  Some historians see this unequal distribution of wealth as important to the Renaissance, as art patronage relies on the very wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pullan |first1=Brian S. |title=History of early Renaissance Italy:From the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fifteenth century |year=1973 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=0-7139-0304-X |oclc=613989155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was not a period of great social or economic change, only of cultural and ideological development.  It only touched a small fraction of the population, and in modern times this has led many historians, such as any that follow [[historical materialism]], to reduce the importance of the Renaissance in human history. These historians tend to think in terms of "[[Early Modern Europe]]" instead. Roger Osborne&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "The Renaissance is a difficult concept for historians because the history of Europe quite suddenly turns into a history of Italian painting, sculpture and architecture."

===Renaissance end===
{{Details|Northern Renaissance}}
[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|[[Giulio Clovio]], ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] Adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''Farnese Hours,'' 1546]]
The end of the Renaissance is as imprecisely marked as its starting point.  For many, the rise to power in Florence of the austere monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in 1494-1498 marks the end of the city's flourishing; for others, the triumphant return of the Medici family to power in 1512 marks the beginning of the late phase in the Renaissance arts called [[Mannerism]].  Other accounts trace the end of the Italian Renaissance to the French invasions of the early 16th century and the subsequent conflict between France and Spanish rulers for control of Italian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Roger, Civilization: A New History of the Western World Pegasus, NY, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Savonarola rode to power on a widespread backlash over the secularism and indulgence of the Renaissance –&lt;ref&gt;Cast, David. "Review: Fra Girolamo Savonarola: Florentine Art and Renaissance Historiography by Ronald M. Steinberg". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 61, No. 1, March 1979. pp. 134-136.&lt;/ref&gt; his brief rule saw many works of art destroyed in the "[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]" in the centre of Florence.  With the Medici returned to power, now as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], the counter movement in the church continued.  In 1542 the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] was formed and a few years later the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' banned a wide array of Renaissance works of literature, which marks the end of the [[illuminated manuscript]] together with [[Giulio Clovio]], who is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

Equally important was the end of stability with a series of foreign invasions of Italy known as the [[Italian Wars]] that would continue for several decades.  These began with the 1494 invasion by France that wreaked widespread devastation on Northern Italy and ended the independence of many of the city-states.  Most damaging was the May 6, 1527, Spanish and German troops' [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacking Rome]] that for two decades all but ended the role of the Papacy as the largest patron of Renaissance art and architecture.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

While the Italian Renaissance was fading, the Northern Renaissance adopted many of its ideals and transformed its styles. A number of Italy's greatest artists chose to emigrate.  The most notable example was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who left for France in 1516, but teams of lesser artists invited to transform the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] created the [[school of Fontainebleau]] that infused the style of the Italian Renaissance in France. From Fontainebleau, the new styles, transformed by [[Mannerism]], brought the Renaissance to [[Antwerp]] and thence throughout Northern Europe.

This spread north was also representative of a larger trend.  No longer was the Mediterranean Europe's most important trade route.  In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India, and from that date the primary route of goods from the Orient was through the Atlantic ports of Lisbon, Seville, Nantes, Bristol, and London.

==Culture==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}

===Literature and poetry===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance literature}}
The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the [[Italian language]] was not the [[literary language]] in Italy.  It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], or [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].  The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' (''Sweet New Style'', which emphasized [[Platonic love|Platonic]] rather than [[courtly love]]) came into its own, pioneered by poets like [[Guittone d'Arezzo]] and [[Guido Guinizelli]].  Especially in [[poetry]], major changes in [[Italian literature]] had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), the author of ''[[The Prince]]'' and prototypical [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. Detail from a portrait by [[Santi di Tito]].]]
With the printing of books initiated in Venice by [[Aldus Manutius]], an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance.  The source for these works expanded beyond works of [[theology]] and towards the pre-Christian eras of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period:  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' reflects a distinctly medieval world view.  [[Christianity]] remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the [[classics]] coming into their own as a second primary influence.

In the early Italian Renaissance, much of the focus was on translating and studying classic works from Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Renaissance authors were not content to rest on the laurels of ancient authors, however.  Many authors attempted to integrate the methods and styles of the ancient Greeks into their own works.  Among the most emulated Romans are [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]], and [[Virgil]].  Among the Greeks, [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]] were now being read in the original for the first time since the 4th century, though Greek compositions were few.

The literature and poetry of the Renaissance was largely influenced by the developing science and philosophy.  The humanist [[Francesco Petrarch]], a key figure in the renewed sense of scholarship, was also an accomplished poet, publishing several important works of poetry.  He wrote poetry in [[Latin]], notably the [[Punic War]] epic ''[[Africa (epic poem)|Africa]]'', but is today remembered for his works in the Italian [[vernacular]], especially the ''[[Canzoniere]]'', a collection of love [[sonnet]]s dedicated to his unrequited love Laura.  He was the foremost writer of [[sonnet]]s in Italian, and translations of his work into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] established the sonnet form in that country, where it was employed by [[William Shakespeare]] and countless other poets.

Petrarch's disciple, [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], became a major author in his own right.  His major work was the ''[[Decameron]]'', a collection of 100 stories told by ten storytellers who have fled to the outskirts of Florence to escape the [[black plague]] over ten nights.  The ''[[Decameron]]'' in particular and Boccaccio's work in general were a major source of inspiration and plots for many English authors in the Renaissance, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Aside from Christianity, [[classical antiquity]], and scholarship, a fourth influence on Renaissance literature was politics. The political philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s most famous works are ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', ''[[Florentine Histories]]'' and finally ''[[The Prince]]'', which has become so well known in Western society that the term "Machiavellian" has come to refer to the ''[[realpolitik]]'' advocated by the book. However, what is ordinarily called "Machiavellianism" is a simplified textbook view of this single work rather than an accurate term for his philosophy. Further, it is not at all clear that Machiavelli himself was the apologist for immorality as whom he is often portrayed: the basic problem is the apparent contradiction between the monarchism of ''The Prince'' and the republicanism of the ''Discourses''. Regardless, along with many other Renaissance works, ''The Prince'' remains a relevant and influential work of literature today.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
[[File:Petrarch by Bargilla.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Petrarch]], from the ''Cycle of Famous Men and Women.'' ca. 1450.  Detached fresco.  {{convert|247|x|153|cm|2|abbr=on}}. Galleria degli [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  Artist: [[Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla]] (ca. 1423–1457).]]
One role of [[Petrarch]] is as the founder of a new method of scholarship,  Renaissance Humanism.

Petrarch encouraged the study of the [[Latin]] classics and carried his copy of Homer about, at a loss to find someone to teach him to read Greek. An essential step in the humanist education being propounded by scholars like [[Pico della Mirandola]] was the hunting down of lost or forgotten manuscripts that were known only by reputation.  These endeavors were greatly aided by the wealth of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who would spend substantial sums building [[libraries]].  Discovering the past had become fashionable and it was a passionate affair pervading the upper reaches of society.  ''I go'', said [[Cyriac of Ancona]], ''I go to awake the dead''. As the Greek works were acquired, manuscripts found, libraries and [[museum]]s formed, the age of the [[printing press]] was dawning.  The works of Antiquity were translated from Greek and Latin into the contemporary modern languages throughout Europe, finding a receptive middle-class audience, which might be, like Shakespeare, "with little Latin and less Greek".

While concern for [[philosophy]], art and literature all increased greatly in the Renaissance the period is usually seen as one of scientific backwardness.  The reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Humanism stressed that nature came to be viewed as an animate spiritual creation that was not governed by laws or mathematics.  At the same time philosophy lost much of its rigour as the rules of [[logic]] and deduction were seen as secondary to intuition and emotion.

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance}}
According to some recent scholarship, the 'father of modern science' is [[Leonardo da Vinci]] whose experiments and clear scientific method earn him this title, Italian universities such as Padua, Bologna and Pisa were scientific centres of renown and with many northern European students, the science of the Renaissance moved to Northern Europe and flourished there, with such figures as [[Copernicus]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Descartes]].   [[Galileo]], a contemporary of Bacon and Descartes, made an immense contribution to scientific thought and experimentation, paving the way for the scientific revolution that later flourished in Northern Europe.
Bodies were also stolen from gallows and examined by many like Vesalius, a professor of anatomy. This allowed them to create accurate skeleton models and correct previously believed theories. For example, many thought that the [[human]] [[Mandible|jawbone]] was made up of two bones, as they had seen this on [[animals]]. However through examining human corpses they were able to understand that humans actually have only one.

===Sculpture and painting===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Last judgement.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1536-1541, by [[Michelangelo]]]]
In painting, the false dawn of [[Giotto]]'s [[Trecento]] realism, his fully three-dimensional figures occupying a rational space, and his humanist interest in expressing the individual personality rather than the iconic images,&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B. J. Maginnis, ''Painting in the Age of Giotto: A Historical Reevaluation'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a retreat into conservative late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Matt Kavaler, "Renaissance Gothic: Pictures of Geometry and Narratives of Ornament," ''Art History,'' Feb 2006, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp 1-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance in painting began anew, in Florence and Tuscany, with the frescoes of [[Masaccio]], then the [[panel painting]]s and [[fresco]]s of [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Paolo Uccello]] which began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s in two-dimensional art more authentically. The figures in Masaccio's frescos painted between 1425 and his death in 1428 have a plasticity unknown up to that point in time.  Compared to the flatness of Gothic painting, his pictures were revolutionary.  Piero della Francesca wrote treatises on scientific perspective. The creation of credible space allowed artists to also focus on the accurate representation of the human body and on naturalistic landscapes.  Completed in 1460, the [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] of [[Andrea Mantegna]], was probably the first good example of Renaissance painting in Northern Italy and became a model for other painters in the region.  At the turn of the 16th century, especially in Northern Italy, artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Giorgione]].  The period also saw the first secular (non-[[religion|religious]]) themes.  There has been much debate as to the degree of [[secularism]] in the Renaissance, which had been emphasized by early 20th-century writers like Jacob Burckhardt, based on, among other things, the presence of  a relatively small number of mythological paintings.  Those of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], notably ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', are now among the best known, although he was deeply religious (becoming a follower of Savonarola) and the great majority of his output was of traditional religious paintings or portraits.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"&gt;Frederick Hartt,  and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In sculpture, [[Donatello]]'s (1386–1466)  study of classical sculpture led to his development of classicizing positions (such as the [[contrapposto]] pose) and subject matter (like the unsupported nude – his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire.)  The progress made by Donatello was influential on all who followed; perhaps the greatest of whom is [[Michelangelo]], whose [[Michelangelo's David|''David'']] of 1500 is also a male nude study;   more naturalistic than Donatello's and with greater emotional intensity. Both sculptures are standing in ''contrapposto'', their weight shifted to one leg.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Blake McHam, ed. ''Looking at Italian Renaissance Sculpture'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The period known as the High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. Pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Pg. 659&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous painters from this phase are Leonardo da Vinci, [[Raphael]], and Michelangelo and their images, including Leonardo's the [[Last Supper (da Vinci)|''Last Supper'']] and ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' and Michelangelo's ''[[Sistine Chapel Ceiling]]'' are the masterpieces of the period and among the most widely known works of art in the world.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"/&gt;

High Renaissance painting evolved into [[Mannerism]], especially in Florence.  Mannerist artists, who consciously rebelled against the principles of High Renaissance, tend to represent elongated figures in illogical spaces.   Modern scholarship has recognized the capacity of Mannerist art to convey strong (often religious) emotion where the High Renaissance failed to do so. Some of the main artists of this period are [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Parmigianino]] and Raphael's pupil [[Giulio Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Italian Renaissance and Mannerist Art'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The dome, completed in 1590, was designed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], architect, painter and poet.]]
{{Main|Italian Renaissance and Mannerist architecture}}
In [[Florence]], the Renaissance style was introduced with a revolutionary but incomplete monument in Rimini by [[Leone Battista Alberti]].  Some of the earliest buildings showing Renaissance characteristics are [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|church of San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]]. The interior of ''Santo Spirito'' expresses a new sense of light, clarity and spaciousness, which is typical of the early Italian Renaissance.  Its architecture reflects the philosophy of [[Humanism]], the enlightenment and clarity of mind as opposed to the darkness and spirituality of the Middle Ages.  The revival of classical antiquity can best be illustrated by the [[Palazzo Rucellai]].  Here the [[pilaster]]s follow the superposition of [[classical orders]], with  [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] on the ground floor, [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals on the uppermost floor. Soon, Renaissance architects favored grand, large domes over tall and imposing spires, doing away with the Gothic style of the predating ages.

In Mantua, [[Leone Battista Alberti]] ushered in the new antique style, though his culminating work, [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], was not begun until 1472, after the architect's death.

[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|[[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' in San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, 1502]]
The High Renaissance, as we call the style today, was introduced to [[Rome]] with [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio]] (1502) and his original centrally planned [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506), which was the most notable architectural commission of the era, influenced by almost all notable Renaissance artists, including [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]].  The beginning of the late Renaissance in 1550 was marked by the development of a new column order by [[Andrea Palladio]].  Colossal columns that were two or more stories tall decorated the [[facade]]s.

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
In Italy during the 14th century there was an explosion of musical activity that corresponded in scope and level of innovation to the activity in the other arts.  Although [[musicologist]]s typically group the music of the [[Trecento]] (music of the 14th century) with the late [[Medieval music|medieval]] period, it included features which align with the early Renaissance in important ways:  an increasing emphasis on secular sources, styles and forms; a spreading of culture away from ecclesiastical institutions to the nobility, and even to the common people; and a quick development of entirely new techniques.  The principal forms were the [[Madrigal (Trecento)|Trecento madrigal]], the [[caccia (music)|caccia]], and the [[ballata]]. Overall, the musical style of the period is sometimes labelled as the "Italian [[ars nova]]." From the early 15th century to the middle of the 16th century, the center of innovation in sacred music was in the [[Low Countries]], and a flood of talented composers came to Italy from this region.  Many of them sang in either the papal choir in Rome or the choirs at the numerous chapels of the aristocracy, in [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]] and elsewhere; and they brought their [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style with them, influencing many native Italian composers during their stay.

The predominant forms of church music during the period were the [[mass (music)|mass]] and the [[motet]].  By far the most famous composer of church music in 16th-century Italy was [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], the most prominent member of the [[Roman School]], whose style of smooth, emotionally cool polyphony was to become the defining sound of the late 16th century, at least for generations of 19th- and 20th-century musicologists.  Other Italian composers of the late 16th century focused on composing the main secular form of the era, the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]:  and for almost a hundred years these secular songs for multiple singers were distributed all over Europe.  Composers of madrigals included [[Jacques Arcadelt]], at the beginning of the age, [[Cipriano de Rore]], in the middle of the century, and [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Philippe de Monte]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]] at the end of the era. Italy was also a centre of innovation in instrumental music.  By the early 16th century keyboard improvisation came to be greatly valued, and numerous composers of virtuoso keyboard music appeared.  Many familiar instruments were invented and perfected in late Renaissance Italy, such as the [[violin]], the earliest forms of which came into use in the 1550s.

By the late 16th century Italy was the musical centre of Europe.  Almost all of the innovations which were to define the transition to the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period originated in northern Italy in the last few decades of the century.  In Venice, the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] productions of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], and associated instrumental music, moved north into Germany; in Florence, the [[Florentine Camerata]] developed [[monody]], the important precursor to [[opera]], which itself first appeared around 1600; and the avant-garde, [[mannerism|manneristic]] style of the [[Ferrara school]], which migrated to [[Naples]] and elsewhere through the music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]], was to be the final statement of the polyphonic vocal music of the Renaissance.

'''KOSMICA''' is an [[institute]] that runs poetical and critical projects about [[outer space]] activities and their impact on [[Earth]]. Its central activity is a series of curated [[festival]]s worldwide with over 20 editions in countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[France]], [[Mexico]] and [[Belgium]]. KOSMICA also counts with other activities such as [[educational program]]mes, [[publishing]] and other curated activities. It has local offices in [[Berlin]] (Germany) and [[Mexico City]] (Mexico), with partner organisations in [[London]] (UK) and [[Montreal]] (Canada).

== History ==
KOSMICA Institute was founded in 2011 by Berlin-based artist [[Nahum (Artist, Musician)|Nahum]] in partnership with [[Arts Catalyst|The Art Catalyst]] in London. It started as ¨a series of galactic gatherings for earth-bound artists, space engineers, performers, astronomers, musicians and anyone interested, explore and share space in original ways. Every session is unique: bringing together the cosmically curious and culturally quirky space community.¨&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artscatalyst.org/themes/astronomy?page=3|title=astronomy {{!}} Arts Catalyst|website=www.artscatalyst.org|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/05/kosmica/|title=Kosmica, June 7, London|last=Sterling|first=Bruce|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today KOSMICA organises regular festival with over 20 international editions and 180 guests from all around the globe. Its curated programmes have included topics such as [[feminism]], [[queer culture]], [[climate change]], [[colonialism]] and [[art]] in [[outer space]].

KOSMICA is endorsed by ITACCUS, the International Astronautical Federation Technical Committee for the Cultural Utilizations of Space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iafastro.org/biographie/nahum-romero/|title=Nahum Romero {{!}} Iaf|website=www.iafastro.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“KOSMICA created an open, affable environment where the topics ranged from philosophy to the social importance of Star Trek.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inspire.rca.ac.uk/reviews-interviews/2013/kosmica-x-astroculture/|title=KOSMICA x Astroculture|last=Art|first=Royal College of Arts - Curating Contemporary|website=inspire.rca.ac.uk|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== KOSMICA Journeys ==
In 2017 KOSMICA partnered up with local organisations and governmental bodies to start a new strand of projects aimed at those who have flown away from their homes for safety and survival reasons. KOSMICA Journeys offers a series of activities for refugees and immigrants to use the outer space perspective and reframe our understanding of Earth as the home of humanity and all its life beyond nations and states.

KOSMICA Journeys started with a collaboration with Hangar 1 in Berlin. Over a month KOSMICA delivered weekly workshops at the refugee center located at the Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin.

[[File:La_Gloria_(Tiziano).jpg|thumb|290px|''La Gloria'']]
'''''La Gloria''''' is a painting by [[Titian]], commissioned by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1550 or 1551 and completed in 1554. It was first given this title by José Sigüenza in 1601 - it is also known as '''''The Trinity''''', '''''The Final Judgement''''' or '''''Paradise'''''. 

It shows an image from [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' describing the glory gained by the blessed and on the right includes Charles himself, with his wife [[Isabella of Portugal]], his son [[Philip II of Spain]], his daughter [[Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joanna of Austria]], [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] and [[Eleanor of Austria]], all wearing their shrouds. Titian's signature is shown on a scroll held by [[John the Evangelist]]. At the top is an image of the [[Holy Trinity]] next to the Virgin Mary and [[Saint John the Baptist]]. The painting also features King David, Moses and Noah, along with a figure in green identified as [[Mary Magdalene]], the [[Erythraean Sibyl]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Rachel]] or the Catholic Church.

Charles took it to the [[Monastery of Yuste]] on his retirement there. It was then moved to the [[Escorial Monastery]] until 1837, when it was mentioned as among the works in the [[Prado Museum]].

==English-language books==

===Parker Brothers===
[[Parker Brothers]], a board game company then owned by [[General Mills]], launched its book publishing division in February 1983;&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KLslAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EfMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6961,2049534&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|agency=[[The New York Times Company|New York Times News Service]]|title=Parker Bros. adding book publishing line|date=February 8, 1983|accessdate=August 9, 2010|work=[[The Miami News]]|page=8A}}&lt;/ref&gt; its first series consisted of six books featuring the Care Bears.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book| last = Wojahn| first = Ellen| title = Playing by Different Rules| year = 1988| publisher = American Management Association (amacom)| isbn = 0-8144-5861-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155–156}}  Various authors contributed to the resulting series, ''Tales from the Care Bears''; Tom Cooke illustrated most of the stories.  At the time of publication, various trade publications took note of Parker Brothers' unique marketing strategy for the books.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|156}}  On October 30, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0706430530/|title=Product information for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|publisher=Amazon.com Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain's [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Octopus Books]] released a book under this title ({{ISBN|0-7064-3053-0}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/tales-from-the-care-bears/oclc/18325762|title=Catalog information for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|work=WorldCat|publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing Amelia Hubert's ''Sweet Dreams for Sally'' and Evelyn Mason's ''A Sister for Sam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=1&amp;isn=0706430530|title=Catalog record for ''Tales from the Care Bears''|accessdate=August 13, 2010|location=[[University of Manchester]]|publisher=[[Copac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker Brothers spent US$1 million in advertising on the original six-book series, which was made to promote the Care Bears characters.  According to a company spokesperson, the stories would demonstrate "love, caring, dreams, happiness, friendship, wishes, and feelings".  The series made its debut at the 1983 [[American International Toy Fair]], along with other Care Bears products.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|155}}  John Keller, editorial director for the books, commented on their creation:

{{quote|The old way was to give authors their head. We, on the other hand, make up a list of, say, thirty interesting plot ideas, and then we do consumer testing ... Once I have the rankings, I call up my pool of authors and give them a plot to work with, and a style sheet explaining the characters. And then I say, "Please write 2,500 words filled with verve and excitement."&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;{{rp|155–156}}}}

[[File:Royalfestivalhall.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Festival Hall]], London, the main base of the orchestra]]
The '''London Philharmonic Orchestra''' ('''LPO''') is one of five permanent symphony [[orchestras]] based in London. It was founded by the conductors [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] and [[Malcolm Sargent]] in 1932 as a rival to the existing [[London Symphony Orchestra|London Symphony]] and [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]s.

The founders' ambition was to build an orchestra the equal of any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war, the orchestra's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years, the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the [[Philharmonia Orchestra|Philharmonia]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]], founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.

By the 1960s the LPO had regained its earlier standards, and in 1964 it secured a valuable engagement to play in the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]] opera house during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the [[Royal Festival Hall]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]], one of London's major concert venues. Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia. In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne, the LPO performs regularly at the [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]], [[Eastbourne]] and the [[Brighton Dome]], and tours nationally and internationally.

Since Beecham, the orchestra has had ten principal conductors, including [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]], [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]] and [[Vladimir Jurowski]]. The orchestra has been active in recording studios since its earliest days, and has played on hundreds of sets made by [[EMI Classics|EMI]], [[Decca Records|Decca]] and other companies. Since 2005 the LPO has had its own record label, issuing live recordings of concerts. The orchestra has played on numerous film soundtracks, including ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy (2001–03).

==History==

===Background===
In the 1920s the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) was the city's best-known concert and recording orchestra. Others were the [[Royal Albert Hall]] Orchestra, the orchestra of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], the [[BBC]]'s Wireless Symphony Orchestra and [[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]]'s [[Queen's Hall]] Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/917033 "The B.B.C."], ''[[The Musical Times]]'', 1 January 1928, p. 70 {{subscription}}; and Elkin, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; All except the last of these were essentially ''ad hoc'' ensembles, with little continuity of personnel,{{refn|Despite the efforts of Wood, Beecham and others, the deputy system remained a traditional part of the London orchestral scene. A player booked for a concert could accept a better-paid engagement and send a substitute in his stead. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described the system thus: "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away."&lt;ref&gt;Levien, John Mewburn, ''quoted'' in Reid (1961), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and none approached the excellence of the best continental and American orchestras. This became obvious in 1927 when the [[Berlin Philharmonic]], under [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The chief music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' later commented, "the British public&amp;nbsp;... was electrified when it heard the disciplined precision of the Berlin Philharmonic&amp;nbsp;... This apparently was how an orchestra could, and, therefore, ought to sound".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Elkin, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; After the Berliners, London heard a succession of major foreign orchestras, including the Amsterdam [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] under [[Willem Mengelberg]] and the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York]] under [[Arturo Toscanini]].&lt;ref name=patmore&gt;Patmore, David. [http://search.proquest.com/docview/968184?accountid=17321 "EMI, Sir Thomas Beecham, and the formation of the London Philharmonic Orchestra"], ''ARSC Journal'', 32(1), 2001, pp. 11–27 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir-Thomas-Beecham-US-1948.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], founding father and first conductor of the LPO]]
Among those determined that London should have a permanent orchestra of similar excellence were [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Sir John Reith]], director-general of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), and the conductor [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]]. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, Nicholas. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/961148 "Beecham and the BBC Symphony Orchestra: A Collaboration that Never Happened"], ''[[The Musical Times]]'', October 1980, pp. 625–628 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, [[Adrian Boult]], launched the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in October 1930, to immense acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;"Music", ''The Times'', 23 October 1930, p. 12; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/914348 "London Concerts"], ''The Musical Times'', December 1930, pp. 1124–1127 {{subscription}}; and "Music", ''The Observer'', 26 October 1930, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor [[Malcolm Sargent]] with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Courtauld]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the LSO, but the orchestra, a self-governing body, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1968), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC having attracted a large number of the finest musicians from other orchestras, many in the musical world doubted that Beecham could find enough good players.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 16; and Jenkins, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He was fortunate in the timing of the enterprise: the depressed economy had severely reduced the number of freelance dates available to orchestral players.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Beecham himself was a strong attraction to many musicians: he later commented, "I always get the players. Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me."&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of the foundation of the LPO, David Patmore writes, "The combination of steady work, occasionally higher than usual rates, variety of performance and Beecham's own magnetic personality would make such an offering irresistible to many orchestral musicians."&lt;ref name=patmore/&gt;

Beecham and Sargent had financial backing from leading figures in commerce, including [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], [[Robert Mayer (philanthropist)|Robert Mayer]] and [[Frédéric Alfred d'Erlanger|Baron Frédéric d'Erlanger]],&lt;ref name=t1&gt;"London Philharmonic Orchestra", ''The Times'', 9 September 1932, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and secured profitable contracts to record for [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] and play for the Royal Philharmonic Society, the [[Royal Choral Society]], the Courtauld-Sargent Concerts, Mayer's concerts for children, and the international opera season at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

During his earlier negotiations with the BBC Beecham had proposed the title "London Philharmonic Orchestra",&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt; which was now adopted for the new ensemble. With the aid of the impresario [[Harold Holt]] and other influential and informed contacts he recruited 106 players. They included a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years, the orchestra was led by [[Paul Beard (violinist)|Paul Beard]] and [[David McCallum, Sr.|David McCallum]], and included leading players such as James Bradshaw, [[Gwydion Brooke]], [[Geoffrey Gilbert]], [[Léon Goossens]], [[Gerald Jackson]], [[Reginald Kell]], [[Anthony Pini]] and [[Bernard Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 135–141&lt;/ref&gt; Holt became the LPO's business manager, and the management board included the orchestra's principal benefactors: Courtauld, Mayer and d'Erlanger.&lt;ref name="t1"/&gt;

===Early years===
[[File:LPO-first-programme-1932.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=concert programme, listing Berlioz's Overture Roman Carnival; Mozart's Prague Symphony; Delius's Brigg Fair and Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben|Programme of the first LPO concert&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(modern reconstruction of unavailable original)&lt;/small&gt;]]
After twelve rehearsals, the orchestra made its debut at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham.{{refn|In earlier years Beecham had been notoriously late for rehearsals, usually arriving an hour after the appointed time,&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), pp. 84 and 92&lt;/ref&gt; but now he assumed a new seriousness, always arriving punctually.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}   After the first item, Berlioz's ''[[Overtures by Hector Berlioz#Le carnaval romain|Roman Carnival Overture]]'', the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout.&lt;ref name=r18&gt;Russell, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' [[Ernest Newman]] wrote, "Nothing so electrifying has been heard in a London concert room for years. The tone was magnificent, the precision perfect, the reading a miracle of fire and beauty, and the enthusiasm of the audience could not have been greater."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Ernest, ''The Sunday Times'', 9 October 1932, ''quoted'' in Moore (unnumbered page)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Times'' [[H. C. Colles|H C Colles]] said that the LPO was "as fine an instrument as could be wished for"; [[Neville Cardus]] wrote in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', "nothing more sumptuous and daring in orchestral playing could be heard in more than three other cities between New York and Vienna"; and [[Walter J. Turner|W J Turner]], of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', praised the orchestra's "youthful dash and virtuosity&amp;nbsp;... at last we have an independent orchestra which rivals the BBC Symphony Orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Philharmonic Society", ''The Times'', 8 October 1932, p. 10; Cardus, Neville. "London's new orchestra", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 October 1932, p. 18; and Turner, W J. "The World of Music", ''The Illustrated London News'', 22 October 1932, p. 638&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first season the LPO played at eighteen concerts in the Courtauld-Sargent series; ten Royal Philharmonic Society concerts; fifteen "International Celebrity Tours" and sixteen Sunday afternoon concerts for Holt's agency, as well as Robert Mayer's children's concerts, Royal Choral Society evenings and other engagements.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Soloists in the first season included the singer [[Eva Turner]] and the pianists [[Harriet Cohen]] and [[Clifford Curzon]].&lt;ref&gt;"London Philharmonic Orchestra", ''The Times'', 22 September 1932, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1932 the sixteen-year-old [[Yehudi Menuhin]] played a programme of violin concertos; those by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] were conducted by Beecham, and the [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|concerto]] was conducted by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;"Concert", ''The Times'', 22 November 1932, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records.&lt;ref name=jefferson89&gt;Jefferson, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This figure refers to discs rather than whole works. The 78&amp;nbsp;rpm recordings then in use required several discs to accommodate a symphony or concerto of even moderate length.&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of works, as opposed to discs, recorded by the LPO and Beecham was less than a hundred.&lt;ref name=s443/&gt;|group= n}} There were a few guest conductors for the Sunday concerts, but most were conducted by Beecham.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In the Courtauld-Sargent series the LPO played not only under Sargent but under many guests including [[Bruno Walter]], [[George Szell]], [[Fritz Busch]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;"Courtauld-Sargent Concerts – Herr Walter's Visit", ''The Times'', 17 January 1933, p. 10; "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 2 October 1933, p. 8; "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 31 July 1934, p. 12; and "Courtauld-Sargent Concerts", ''The Times'', 19 October 1937, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to London engagements, the orchestra played regularly in the larger provincial cities and towns. Its first tour, in March and April 1933, started in Bristol and ended in Manchester, taking in thirteen other venues in England, Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; After the last concert, ''The Manchester Guardian's'' reviewer wrote:
{{quote|Never before in our experience of concert-going in Manchester have we heard orchestral playing which, throughout a whole programme, combined such nobility of style and brilliancy of execution – not the brilliancy that stops when it has made outward forms sparkle, but a quality that seems to work from within and to suffuse everything with a rich and glowing tone-colour.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Thomas Beecham's Orchestra", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 3 April 1933, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Beecham took the orchestra on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored the custom of playing the [[Nazi]] anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded to pressure from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s government not to play the [[Symphony No. 4 (Mendelssohn)|''Italian'' Symphony]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], taboo to Nazi [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semites]]. There was disquiet among some of the players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 39–40, and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and post-war years===
As his sixtieth birthday approached in 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands.&lt;ref name=Lucas239&gt;Lucas, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure the future of the orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared.&lt;ref name=reid218&gt;Reid (1961), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Queen's-Hall-1912.jpg|thumb|[[Queen's Hall]], destroyed, with many LPO instruments, by bombing in 1941]]
During the war the LPO played in the capital and on continual tours of Britain, under Sargent and other conductors, bringing orchestral concerts to places where they had rarely if ever been given. Many of the players' instruments were lost when the Queen's Hall was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941; an appeal was broadcast by the BBC, the response to which was enormous, with instruments donated by the public enabling the orchestra to continue.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

On Beecham's return to England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Glock|Glock, William]], "Music", ''[[The Observer]]'' 8 October 1944, p. 2; and "Sir T. Beecham's Return", ''The Times'', 9 October 1944, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1961), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]] (RPO).&lt;ref name=reid231&gt;Reid (1961), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the conductors making guest appearances in the early post-war period were Walter, Furtwängler, [[Victor de Sabata]] and [[Sergiu Celibidache]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Such starry events were the exception; as a rule the orchestra worked with less eminent conductors, giving an unprecedented number of performances. In 1949–50 they gave 248 concerts, compared with 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra and 32 each by the [[Philharmonia]] and RPO.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; After a seven-year interregnum the orchestra engaged a new principal conductor, [[Eduard van Beinum]], in 1947.  He was initially able to work with the orchestra for only six months of the year, because of restrictions on work permits for foreign nationals. Guest conductors stood in during his absences. In 1947 the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] was founded as the chorus for the LPO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpc.org.uk/about.html "About the Choir"] London Philharmonic Choir, retrieved 4 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
Van Beinum's poor health obliged him to resign in 1950. Sir Adrian Boult, who had been forced out of the BBC by internal politics, accepted an invitation from the LPO's managing director, Thomas Russell, to take up the principal conductorship.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; With Boult the LPO began a series of commercial recordings, beginning with Elgar's ''[[Falstaff (Elgar)|Falstaff]]'', Mahler's ''[[Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen]]'' with the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Blanche Thebom]], and Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 231"&gt;Kennedy, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the new team was greeted with approval by reviewers. Of the Elgar, the reviewer in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' wrote, "I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance.&amp;nbsp;... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably".&lt;ref&gt;''The Gramophone'', May 1951, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Boult's biographer [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as "gruelling", with twelve concerts in as many days.&lt;ref name=kb&gt;Kennedy, p. 232; and Boult, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Kennedy states that there were 11 concerts, but Boult lists 12 dates and venues.&lt;ref name=kb/&gt;|group= n}} The symphonies they played were Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh]], Haydn's [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|''London'', No 104]], Brahms's [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|First]], Schumann's [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|Fourth]] and Schubert's [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|''Great C major'']]. The other works were Elgar's [[Introduction and Allegro (Elgar)|Introduction and Allegro]], Holst's ''[[The Perfect Fool]]'' ballet music, [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'', and Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boult, p. 202; and Kennedy, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Conductors of the 1951–52 season other than Boult included [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[William Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Festival Hall and Shot Tower c1959.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Festival Hall in the 1950s: the LPO was among the orchestras striving for residency]]
In 1952, the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with [[Decca Records]] that was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 percent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist party]];&lt;ref name="Kennedy 231"/&gt; when the [[Cold War|cold war]] began, some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be "seriously jeopardized financially" if Russell remained in post.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, pp. 215–222&lt;/ref&gt; A later writer, [[Richard Witts]], suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].{{refn|Witts concludes that it was not Russell but Boult – regarded by some as past his peak – who cost the LPO the Festival Hall residency.&lt;ref&gt;Witts, Richard.

The following year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including [[Paul Kletzki]], [[Jean Martinon]], [[Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Walter Susskind]] and Vaughan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Donald. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/933482 "Promenade Concerts"], ''The Musical Times'', October 1953, p. 472 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 the LPO toured the [[Soviet Union]], the first British orchestra to do so; the conductors were Boult, [[Anatole Fistoulari]] and [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]], and the soloists were [[Alfredo Campoli]] and [[Moura Lympany]].&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Maurice. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/936914 "The London Philharmonic Orchestra in Russia"], ''The Musical Times'', February 1957, pp. 67–69 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tour Boult retired as principal conductor, but remained closely associated with the orchestra, and was made its President in 1965. Most of his stereophonic recordings for [[EMI Classics|EMI]] were made with the LPO.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone and Mundy, pp. 81–96; and Pirouet, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the middle and late 1950s the LPO worked with new conductors including [[Constantin Silvestri]] and [[Josef Krips]]. This was a bad period financially for the orchestra, and it was forced to abandon fixed contracts for its players with holiday and sick pay and pensions, and revert to payment by engagement.&lt;ref name=moore&gt;Moore (unnumbered page)&lt;/ref&gt; Financial disaster was averted thanks to an anonymous benefactor, generally believed to be Boult.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; A historian of the orchestra, Edmund Pirouet, writes that having been on an upward curve in the 1940s, by the mid-1950s the orchestra "was at best marking time".&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the LPO appointed [[William Steinberg]], also music director of the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]], as chief conductor. He was a noted orchestral trainer, and did much to restore playing standards to their former levels.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Steinberg resigned the LPO post after two seasons, advised by his doctor to restrict his activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr Steinberg leaving London Philharmonic", ''The Guardian'', 1 August 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s and 70s===
[[File:Glyndebourne 2.jpg|thumb|Glyndebourne, where the LPO took over as resident orchestra in 1964]]
In 1962 the orchestra undertook its first tour of India, Australia, and the Far East. The conductors were Sargent and [[John Pritchard (conductor)|John Pritchard]]. The latter was appointed the LPO's chief conductor in 1962, presiding over what one player described as "an era of supremely good taste".&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; From its outset in 1932, harpists (traditionally female) excepted, the orchestra had maintained Beecham's "men only" regime; in 1963 the rule was dropped, the first woman violinist was recruited, and within two years female players achieved equal conditions of membership with their male colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Pritchard was also music director of [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] in [[Sussex]], and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 132 and 134&lt;/ref&gt; The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra's finances.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 139&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including [[Danny Kaye]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Tony Bennett]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Its regular complement at the end of the decade was 88 players.&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernard Haitink 1984b.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Bernard Haitink]], principal conductor, 1967–79]] 
In 1967 the LPO appointed [[Bernard Haitink]] as its principal conductor. He remained with the orchestra for twelve years, to date (2018) the longest tenure of the post. His concerts made a strong impression with the public, and within months the LPO was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the Festival Hall, far outstripping the other London orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Among the composers with whom Haitink was associated were [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], whose symphonies featured frequently in the LPO's concerts during the Haitink period, as did those of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], particularly the [[Symphony No. 10 (Shostakovich)|Tenth]], which Pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], Haitink and the LPO gave a six-concert cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and piano concertos, for which the Festival Hall was full to capacity. In ''The Times'', Joan Chissell described the orchestra's playing as "worthy of any festival".&lt;ref&gt;Chissell, Joan. "LPO/Haitink", ''The Times'', 18 March 1974, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; There was some discontent within the LPO that Haitink's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Pirouet comments that as Haitink recorded exclusively for the Dutch firm [[Philips Records|Philips]] it was to be expected that the Amsterdam orchestra would be preferred, and in any case the LPO was recording extensively with Boult, Solti, [[Daniel Barenboim]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s international tours continued, with itineraries taking in the US, Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and, in 1972, China, long inaccessible to Western musicians, where the orchestra met an enthusiastic welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the LPO was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge.&lt;ref name=p155/&gt; On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.&lt;ref name=p155&gt;Pirouet, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir George Solti 6 Allan Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Solti|Sir Georg Solti]], principal conductor, 1979–83]]
One of the constant difficulties of London orchestras was the lack of good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in [[Southwark]], converting it into the [[Henry Wood Hall, London|Henry Wood Hall]], a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Mann (critic)|Mann, William]]. "The making of a rehearsal hall", ''The Times'', 17 June 1975, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Guest conductors in the 1970s included [[Erich Leinsdorf]], [[Carlo Maria Giulini]], [[Eugen Jochum]], [[Riccardo Chailly]], [[Klaus Tennstedt]] and Solti. When Haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978–79 season, Solti, who had been principal guest conductor since 1971, agreed to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
In 1982 the orchestra celebrated its [[golden jubilee]].{{refn|A contemporaneous book listed the many famous soloists who had worked with the LPO in its fifty years. Among them were [[soprano]]s and [[mezzo-soprano|mezzos]] such as [[Janet Baker]], [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schumann]], [[Joan Sutherland]] and Eva Turner, [[tenors]] including [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Richard Tauber]]; the cellists [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Jacqueline du Pré]]; the violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Fritz Kreisler]] and [[David Oistrakh]], and the pianists [[Alfred Brendel]], Clifford Curzon, [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], [[Maurizio Pollini]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;|group= n}} At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments that with the exception of [[Frederick Delius|Delius]]'s ''[[Brigg Fair#Delius orchestral setting|Brigg Fair]]'', the music was as ideally suited to Solti's musical persona as to Beecham's.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Edward Greenfield]] wrote, "I doubt if the LPO has ever played so beautifully, even in the days of Beecham".&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "LPO/Solti – 50th anniversary", ''The Guardian'', 8 October 1982, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Solti stepped down at the end of the jubilee season, and was succeeded by Klaus Tennstedt, of whom ''The Times'' commented, "Tennstedt found the orchestra sensitive and flexible, and his players regarded him with a warmth that is by no means universally extended by musicians to their conductors".&lt;ref name=tten&gt;"Klaus Tennstedt", ''The Times'', 13 January 1998, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His time as chief conductor (1983–87) was celebrated for its musical achievements, but was marked by his failing health and frequent cancellations. As with Haitink and Solti, Bruckner and Mahler were prominent in the LPO's concerts with Tennstedt. Unlike his two predecessors Tennstedt preferred to record with the LPO rather than major continental or American orchestras; among the many sets they made together was a complete cycle of Mahler's symphonies for EMI.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "A German vision for London music", ''The Guardian'', 13 January 1998, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;      In 1984 the LPO and the Philharmonia{{refn|The New Philharmonia had bought back the rights to the original title in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;"Orchestra resumes its old title", ''The Times'', 2 September 1977, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} began negotiations that went on for years following an [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] proposal to name one London orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the Festival Hall, with concomitant extra funding. The two orchestras were interested in making a counter-proposal for a joint residency, but the matter was not resolved until 1995 when their plan was finally implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 183 and 223&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset of the LPO's existence as a self-governing co-operative in 1939, its chief executive had always been appointed from within the orchestra's ranks. In 1985 this tradition was broken with the recruitment of John Willan, a qualified accountant as well as an alumnus of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and a successful recording producer for EMI.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welser-Möst-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Welser-Möst]], principal conductor, 1990–96]]
In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to continuing in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, with the title of "conductor laureate";&lt;ref name=tten/&gt; in 1989 [[Richard Morrison (music critic)|Richard Morrison]] of ''The Times'' wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than for anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Richard. "Mahler's quiet hero", ''The Times'', 17 February 1989, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tennstedt's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, and there was no obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, [[Riccardo Muti]] and [[Simon Rattle]] – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and those possible contenders such as [[Semyon Bychkov (conductor)|Semyon Bychkov]] and [[Franz Welser-Möst]] were largely unknown in London.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Richard. "Tennstedt hard to replace", ''The Times'', 26 August 1987, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; No successor was appointed until 1990 when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname "Frankly Worse than Most" and many harshly critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Hewett, Ivan. [http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:DST1&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10C17B3091A620A0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=102CDD40F14C6BDA "Why all those insults made me stronger"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 18 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He brought with him a recording contract with EMI, but management turnover, financial stresses, and political disputes at the [[Southbank Centre]] at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, Nicholas [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED9163EF936A25750C0A964958260 "A Young Conductor Starts at the Top"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 March 1992; and Oestreich, James R.

"And lost at sea", ''The Times'', 22 May 1996, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Welser-Möst's period as principal conductor coincided with the installation of the LPO as the sole resident orchestra of the Festival Hall. This proved a mixed blessing: the Southbank Centre management now had a say over concert programming, and insisted on the inclusion of works by obscure composers{{refn|Pirouet singles out [[Nikolai Roslavets]] as the most extreme example.&lt;ref name=p208/&gt;|group= n}} which did severe damage to box-office receipts.&lt;ref name=p208&gt;Pirouet, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 another official attempt to create a "super-orchestra" at the expense of one or more of the existing London ensembles briefly damaged relations between the LPO and the Philharmonia, but the idea was quickly abandoned, and in 1995, with the consent of the Arts Council, the two orchestras agreed to share the residency at the Festival Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, pp. 217–220, and 223&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, with the government of South Africa now moving towards majority rule, the orchestra accepted an invitation to tour there.&lt;ref&gt;Pirouet, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Welser-Möst concluded his LPO tenure in 1996, after what ''The Guardian'' called "a fraught few years in which the high hopes placed in him were somehow not fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;Chancellor, Alexander. "Orchestral manoeuvres", ''The Guardian'', 20 July 1996, p. A24&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
[[File:Юровский иконка.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vladimir Jurowski]], principal conductor from 2007]]
After the departure of Welser-Möst, the LPO was without a principal conductor for four years. During the interregnum the orchestra inaugurated its "Roots Classical Fusions" series, which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/history.html "History"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 6 September&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Masur]] was the LPO's principal conductor from 2000 to 2007. Under Masur, known for his performances of the German symphonic repertoire, the orchestra regained its musical form, and the critic Richard S Ginell commented that [[Vladimir Jurowski]], who took over in 2007 "has inherited an LPO in splendid technical shape, probably having been drilled to a fare-thee-well under Masur".&lt;ref&gt;Ginell, Richard S. "Orchestral Upheavals: Gergiev and Jurowski in London", ''American Record Guide'', July 2008, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurowski had first conducted the LPO in 2001, making an immediate mark in a programme of Finnish, French and Russian music. The reviewer in ''The Daily Telegraph'' wrote of "love at first sight between conductor and orchestra&amp;nbsp;... one of the LPO's finest hours in the concert hall".&lt;ref&gt;Rye, Matthew. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727030/Last-minute-stand-in-makes-an-electrifying-debut.html "Last-minute stand-in makes an electrifying debut"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Jurowski became principal guest conductor in 2003, and conducted the orchestra in June 2007 during the concerts marking the re-opening of the refurbished Festival Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Tim. [http://music.guardian.co.uk/classical/livereviews/story/0,,2103890,00.html LPO/Jurowski], ''The Guardian'', 15 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 Jurowski became the LPO's eleventh principal conductor. In November 2007, the LPO named [[Yannick Nézet-Séguin]] as its new principal guest conductor, effective from the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;Shihoten, Kevin. [http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/7385.html "Nézet-Séguin Named London Phil Principal Guest Conductor"], ''Playbill Arts'', 20 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his LPO predecessors Pritchard and Haitink, Jurowski was appointed music director of Glyndebourne (2001–13); he conducted the LPO there in operas by Britten, Mozart, [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], Richard Strauss, [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://glyndebourne.com/archive/individual/vladimir-jurowski "Vladimir Jurowski"], Glyndebourne, retrieved 8 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the leading members of the LPO organisation were Jurowski, [[Andrés Orozco-Estrada]] (principal guest conductor), Pieter Schoeman (leader), [[Magnus Lindberg]] (composer in residence) and Timothy Walker (chief executive and artistic director).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/musician-biographies/ "Who's who in the orchestra"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen of the orchestra's principal players held professorships at British conservatoires, including the Royal Academy of Music, the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/professorial-appointments.html "Professorial appointments"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its regular concerts at the Festival Hall, and its annual season in the orchestra pit at Glyndebourne, the LPO has residencies at the [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]], [[Eastbourne]] and the [[Brighton Dome]], and tours in Britain and overseas remain an important part of the orchestra's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/about/on-tour.html "Where we play"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 26 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
In its early years, the LPO recorded exclusively for Columbia, a division of EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' at [[Kingsway Hall]] in September 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite ''The Origin of Design'', arranged from music by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine [[Gramophone record#78 rpm disc developments|78-rpm]] sets with the orchestra.&lt;ref name=disco&gt;Stuart, pp. 443–450&lt;/ref&gt; Other conductors who worked in the EMI studios with the orchestra in its early years included Elgar, [[Felix Weingartner]], [[John Barbirolli]], and [[Serge Koussevitzky]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;Stuart, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists [[Artur Schnabel]] and [[Alfred Cortot]] and the violinists [[Fritz Kreisler]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]].&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;

In 1946 the orchestra began recording for EMI's rival, Decca. The LPO's first recording for the label, Stravinsky's ''[[Petrushka]]'', conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]], was followed by a large number of sessions as the company rebuilt its catalogue after the war.&lt;ref name=decca/&gt; Among those who recorded with the orchestra for Decca were van Beinum, Sargent, de Sabata, Furtwängler, [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]], [[Clemens Krauss]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Erich Kleiber]] and the young Solti.&lt;ref name=decca&gt;Stuart, Philip. [http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/discography/decca.html ''Decca Classical, 1929–2009''], AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra's first [[stereophonic]] recording was made for Decca in 1956, with Boult in Vaughan Williams's [[Symphony No. 8 (Vaughan Williams)|Eighth Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its London rivals the RPO and the Philharmonia (both of whom recorded for many years only for EMI and its associates, with the rarest of exceptions), the post-war LPO was not exclusively associated with one company, and as well as Decca it recorded for Philips, [[Sony Classical Records|CBS]], [[RCA Red Seal Records|RCA]], [[Chandos Records|Chandos]] and many other labels.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; For some years in the 1950s and 1960s the orchestra was contracted to two companies at once, and consequently appeared under the name "the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra" in some of its recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone and Mundy, pp. 80–96&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s the orchestra was particularly associated with [[Lyrita]], an independent company specialising in neglected British repertoire.&lt;ref name=decca/&gt; In most LPO recordings for Lyrita the conductor was Boult; in the same period he also recorded extensively for EMI, with the LPO his preferred orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPO plays on many opera recordings, some taped live at Glyndebourne and the Festival Hall, and others in the studios of Decca and EMI. They range from early works  such as Cavalli's ''[[L'Ormindo]]'' (recorded 1968) and Glydebourne's staging of Handel's ''[[Theodora (Handel)|Theodora]]'' (1996) to central repertoire such as ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (1974), ''[[Carmen]]'' (1975 and 2002) and ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'' (2011), and première recordings of 20th-century works including Vaughan Williams's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress (opera)|The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1972), Shostakovich's ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk]]'' (1979) and  [[Péter Eötvös|Eötvös]]'s ''[[Love and Other Demons]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://glyndebourne.com/shop/cds-audio?page=all "CDs and audio"], Glyndebourne, retrieved 8 September 2014 (''Theodora'', ''Carmen'' (2002), ''Die Meistersinger'' and ''Love and Other Demons''); Stuart, Philip.

===Film scores and other non-classical recordings===

Although not rivalling the LSO's total of more than 200 film score recordings, the LPO has played for a number of soundtracks, starting in 1936 with ''[[Whom the Gods Love]]''. The orchestra played for ten films made during the Second World War, and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s, with the major exception of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962). Later scores have included those for ''[[Antony and Cleopatra (1972 film)|Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1972), ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1973), ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' (1988), ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' (1993), the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy (2001–03) and most of the music for the [[The Hobbit (film series)|three films]] derived from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (2012–14).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpo.org.uk/recordings/film-highlights.html "Film highlights"], London Philharmonic Orchestra, retrieved 5 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra has made many non-classical recordings, including such titles as ''Hawaiian Paradise'' (1959), ''[[Evita (album)|Evita]]'' (1976), ''Broadway Gold'' (1978), ''Folk Music of the Region of Asturias'' (1984), ''Academy Award Themes'' (1984), ''Japanese Light Music'' (1993), ''The Symphonic Music of Pink Floyd'' (1994) and ''The Symphonic Music of The Who'' (1995).&lt;ref name=s443&gt;Stuart, p. 443–450&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the orchestra recorded the 205 national anthems to be used at medal ceremonies at the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic]] Games in London the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/news/london-2012-hands-baton-london-philharmonic-orchestra "London 2012 Hands Baton to London Philharmonic Orchestra"], IPC, 15 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''Lotus chalice''' or '''Alabaster chalice''', called the '''Wishing Cup''' by [[Howard Carter]], derives from the [[Tomb of Tutankhamun|tomb]] of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] ([[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). The object received the find number 014 and is now on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]], with the inventory number JE 67465.

== Discovery ==
The tomb of the young king in the [[List_of_burials_in_the_Valley_of_the_Kings#East_Valley|East Valley of the Kings]] ([[KV62]]) was uncovered almost untouched in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in West [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Howard Carter]] on 4 November 1922. The lotus chalice was one of the first objects which Carter and his excavators found on entering the tomb. The vessel was almost directly behind the entrance of the corridor to the antechamber, where they broke in, on the ground. This was not its original position.&lt;ref&gt;Jaromir Malek. ''The Treasures of Tutankhamun.'' London 2006, {{ISBN|0-233-00197-2}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and significance ==
[[File:Heh.svg|thumb|upright|[[Heh (god)|Heh]] kneeling on the Neb symbol with the symbols of infinity: Shen ring, tadpoles and palm rib]]
The lotus chalice is made from a single piece of [[alabaster]]. The chalice has the shape of a [[Nymphaea|lotus]] in full bloom. The handles on both sides are identical, shaped like lotus flowers growing upward, with the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Heh (god)|Heh]] seated on a basket (the neb symbol) on the tips of the leaves. In each hand Heh holds a palm rib with notches for counting the years and a tadpole sitting on a [[shen ring]] below each one. This is a typical depiction of the god of the "million years", the god of infinity and eternity: the palm rib is the [[Hieroglyph]] for year, while both the shen ring and the tadpole were symbols of eternity. A kneeling image of the god was the hieroglyph for the number "one million". The same motif is found on other items from the tomb. For example, wooden stool (JE 62029, find number 87). At the upper end of each palm rib there is an [[ankh]] symbol, the sign of life. The chalice therefore symbolises the infinite and eternal life of King Tutankhamun.

The lotus is significant in [[Egyptian mythology]] for the birth of the sun god, who emerged from the lotus, after it had risen out of the flood of the primeval waters of [[Nun]]. The name of the king in the centre of the white open flower therefore symbolised his rebirth.

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:Tutankhamen tomb layout.jpg|thumb|upright|Floorplan of KV62]]
The inscriptions are engraved and filled with dark paste. Howard Carter copied the inscriptions and asked [[Alan Gardiner]] to provide a translation, since he required this for publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/perl/gi-ca-qmakedeta.pl?sid=95.89.186.47-1387916681&amp;qno=1&amp;dfnam=014-c014-2 ''Card/Transcription No.: 014-2'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The main lotus, which forms the actual chalice, had the king's [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|throne name]] (''Neb-kheperw-Re'' - Lord in Forms, Re) and personal name (''Twt-ankh-amun'' - Living image of [[Amun]]), "may he live forever." The first column names him as "beloved of [[Amun-Re]], Lord of the throne of the two Lands (''Neb-neswt tawi''), Lord of Heaven (''Neb-pet'').&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Theodor Zauzich: ''Hieroglyphen ohne Geheimnis.'' (= ''[[Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt]].''). von Zabern, Darmstadt/ Mainz 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8053-4267-4}}. S. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing runs from right to left.

The inscription on the rim of the chalice is to be read in two directions. From right to left, beginning with the [[Horus]] falcon, are the more rarely attested Horus name and Nebty name of Tutankhamun. From left to right, beginning with the [[ankh]] symbol, is the following:
: ''May your ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'' live, may you spend millions of years, you, who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness.''&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Reeves, John H. Taylor: ''Howard Carter before Tutankhamun.'' British Museum Press; London 1992, {{ISBN|0-714-10959-2}}, p. 188; T. G. H. James: ''Tutanchamun. Der ewige Glanz des jungen Pharaos.'' Köln 2000, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;


Because of the inscription, Howard Carter called the lotus chalice the ''King's Wishing Cup''. The wish inscription from the lotus chalice is quoted on the second gravestone of Howard Carter.

== Display ==
In addition to being displayed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, the lotus chalice was among the original finds selected for the first temporary exhibition of the [[grave goods]] of Tutankhamun. It was also on display with the exhibition number 39 in the world-touring ''[[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972–1981)|Treasures of Tutankhamun]]'' exhibition.

'''Momart''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] company specialising in the storage, transportation, and installation of works of [[art]].

A major proportion of their business is maintaining (often delicate) artworks in a secure, climate-controlled environment. The company maintains specialist [[warehouse]] facilities adapted for this task. Momart's clients include the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[Tate Modern]], [[Tate Britain]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The company received considerable media attention in 2004 when a fire spread to one of their warehouses from an adjacent unit, destroying the works in it, including works by [[Young British Artists]] such as [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Damien Hirst]], with the most well known work lost being Emin's 1995 piece ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''. On 5 March 2008 Momart was taken over by  [[Falkland Islands Holdings]] for a value of £10.3 Million &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/311966/fine-art-move-by-falkland.thtml|title=Fine art move by Falkland|date=2008-03-07|work=Growth Company Investor|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which £4.6 Million was in cash, £2.5 Million was with shares and £3.2 was deferred consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fihplc.com/download/Momart_acquisition030308.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Momart began in 1971 as the “Jim Moyes’s Compendium of Working Possibilities”, with its founder, himself an artist, offering installation, display, handling, transport and framing services to up an coming artists and emergent galleries in London. Early users of the service included [[David Hockney]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. The client base quickly grew by word of mouth in recognition of the service levels being offered and in September 1972 the company was registered as Momart Limited&amp;nbsp;– an amalgam of Jim Moyes and new partner Rees Martin. Rees subsequently left the business but the brand was becoming well established so the name remained.

=== Early days ===

The company set up its first office on Richmond Road, Hackney in East London and continued to grow organically – moving art, painting gallery walls, making frames and cases, hanging paintings, slinging sculpture and providing art storage. By 1985 Momart had gained a solid reputation amongst the commercial galleries and artists and started to introduce its credentials to the public sector such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], the [[National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] and other UK based art institutions.

In 1985, Momart commissioned the UK’s first fine art vehicle with temperature control and air ride suspension and carried out its first museum job on behalf of the Royal Academy - a [[Henry Moore]] exhibition. Momart was by then able to undertake all of the transport handling requirements completely in-house, including making site visits to the individual lenders where required, case making, transport of the empty cases to the lenders, pack on site and delivery of the case loan to the borrower.

=== Research and development ===
From 1988 Momart expanded the services to include the international movement of artworks on behalf of both commercial and museum clients overseas. This prompted close analysis and investigation of the various case making options and specifications and in 1991, in collaboration with Tate, the company assisted with the development and the standard specification for museum cases for touring exhibitions and for sending artworks worldwide. This was then presented at the Art in Transit Conference in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/8127/mci_Art_in_Transit_Handbook_for_Packing_and_Transporting_Paintings.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Warrant ===

Momart’s client base continued to expand. In the late 1980s the company started working for the Royal Collection and, in 1993, in recognition of the high quality of service provided by Momart, Her Majesty The Queen appointed Momart as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant]] holder.

=== New storage facilities ===

In 2003 Momart invested in new premises in [[Leyton]], with new plant and equipment and room for expansion. This included a new state-of-the-art workshop, storage facilities and transport office with Hackney remaining as the office base for the project coordination, administration and some satellite warehousing. This investment improved efficiency and capacity for increased storage business. In the same year Momart was granted Listed Agent status with the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) allowing certified Momart employees to carry out hand search procedures on client artworks to avoid the need for X-raying at the airport of departure.

=== Falkland Islands Holding ===

In 2008 Momart was acquired by Falkland Islands Holdings (FIH) the international services group that owns services businesses focused on transport and logistics. Following the acquisition, Momart's key management and staff has continued to work within the group to drive the company’s continued expansion, particularly in rapidly growing overseas markets. In that same year Momart’s administrative offices were moved from Hackney to Whitechapel from where the company operated all of the administration, coordination, shipping, finance, IT services.

=== Customs procedures ===

In 2009 HMRC granted Momart the then unique privilege amongst fine art transport companies to undertake all of its customs procedures in-house. Couple of years later, in 2011, Momart has been certified as an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/aeo_home.jsp?Lang=en|title=Authorised Economic Operator|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the company to simplify customs bureaucracy and speed up passage within the EU for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/authorised-economic-operator-certification|title=Authorised Economic Operator|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''New premises''' ===
In 2013 the company relocated its head office to South Quay, East London where it currently resides.

In 2016 Momart expanded its storage facilities in [[Leyton]], East London, with a new purpose-built unit providing additional 2,500 square metres of specialist art storage space.

== ARTIM ==
In 2001 Momart and five other respected international fine art transport agents founded the professional association ARTIM, whose members monitor each other's service levels both professionally and financially. ARTIM comprises the leading fine art agents worldwide who have the highest standards of service. Agents wishing to join ARTIM have to be voted in with a majority vote by the Founders’ Committee before becoming members. The association has gained much respect due to the calibre of the membership and although it cannot be used as an advertising tool in any way, offers great mutual support and benefits to its members and thereby to its clients and to the art world as a whole.

== The 2004 warehouse fire ==

In the early hours of 24 May 2004 a fire broke out at the Cromwell industrial estate in Leyton, east London. According to the fire investigation report, the flames that caught between 1.45 am and 3.15 am that morning were started deliberately, after burglars broke into a unit located at the extreme south-western corner of the estate and leased to an individual business repairing consumer electronics. 

The fire spread through the adjoining units at the estate, eventually reaching and destroying a warehouse then operated by Momart.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/27/thebritartfire.arts1|title=50 years of British art lies in ashes|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram|date=2004-05-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blaze destroyed more than 100 works by some of Britain's leading contemporary artists including Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Helen Chadwick and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3748179.stm|title=Fire devastates Saatchi artworks|date=2004-05-26|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those works were owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], the country's biggest collector of modern art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Art industry insiders noted at the time that the insurance value of the works lost in the fire would be many times their initial purchase price, and that a comparable rise could be expected in the market values of the remaining (and future) works by artists whose works were lost. The total value of artworks lost was estimated at between £30 and £50 million.

A number of artists, in a joint action with several insurance firms, alleged negligence and pursued a legal case against Momart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1592859/Art-blaze-sparks-lawsuits-against-Momart.html|title=Art blaze sparks lawsuits against Momart|work=This is Money|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled out of court in a mediated agreement for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the order of  “tens of millions of pounds”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plone.unige.ch/art-adr/cases-affaires/warehouse-fire-2013-gillian-ayres-et-al-and-momart|title=Warehouse Fire – Gillian Ayres et al. and Momart — Centre du droit de l'art|website=plone.unige.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Momart Christmas card series ==
The tradition of the Christmas card goes back to 1984 when the first object – a festive card – was designed for the company by Bruce McLean. Since then Momart collaborated on this project with many of the top British and international artists. The complete series of Momart Christmas card is now part of the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate.

The '''Old King's Head Hotel''' is a hotel and [[public house]] at 48–50 Lower Bridge Street, on the corner of Castle Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376307|desc= The Old Kings Head Hotel, Chester|accessdate= 30 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building was constructed in about 1208.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was the town house for Peter the Clerk, the administrator of [[Chester Castle]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 63| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It initially contained a section of the [[Chester Rows]], but these were enclosed during the alterations made between the 15th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The latest of these alterations were made for [[Randle Holme#Randle Holme I (1570/71–1655)|Randle Holme&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The building was restored in 1935,&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; and again during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Architecture==

It is basically a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] building, part of which has been refaced with yellow [[sandstone]], and with brick that has been painted or [[Cement render|rendered]]. The roofs are [[slate]]d.   The building is in three storeys, of which the upper storey facing Lower Bridge Street is [[jettying|jettied]].  Both faces have three [[bay (architecture)|bays]].  The three bays on Lower Bridge Street are [[gable]]d, as is the middle bay on Castle Street.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

'''Ottonian art''' is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was re-established under the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.  Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church.  However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 81–86; Lasko, 82; Dodwell, 123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from [[Byzantine art]] and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as "a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277"&gt;Honour and Fleming, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 004.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|"Roma", "Gallia", "Germania" and "Sclavinia" pay homage to Otto III, from the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], one of the "Liuthar group"]]

Following late Carolingian styles, "[[presentation miniature|presentation portraits]]" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art,&lt;ref&gt;in contrast, there are no surviving contemporary portraits of [[Charlemagne]] in manuscripts&lt;/ref&gt; and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of [[Late Antiquity]], such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic]], and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]]. This goal was accomplished in various ways.  For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 123; Imperial portraiture is a major subject in Garrison&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of [[spolia]] from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity.  This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and other building materials from the [[Palace of Theoderic]] in [[Ravenna]] and reused them in his new cathedral at [[Magdeburg]].  The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features.

In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain [[presentation miniature]]s depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St [[Pirmin]], founder of [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the "command structure" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solothurn]] Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89–90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140-141; Dodwell, 134; the [[Egbert Psalter]] also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byzantine art]] also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess [[Theophanu]] to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers.  However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times.  The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills,&lt;ref&gt;Or so it is usually assumed, but see Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt; some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen,&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and some [[lay brother]]s and lay assistants employed by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;An area where evidence is generally thin across Europe, see Cherry, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  While secular [[medieval jewelry|jewellery]] supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, [[ivory carving]] at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.

==Manuscripts==
[[File:CodexEgberti-Fol052v-ResurrectionOfLazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Egberti]], ''Resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'', "Ruodprecht group"]]
Ottonian monasteries produced most if not all of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.  The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;

In contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] devoted to "strips" in three tiers with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' and his [[Parables of Jesus|parables]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, throughout; Dodwell, 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich [[treasure binding]]s and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the "[[Eburnant group]]" were made, perhaps at [[Lorsch]], as several miniatures in the [[Gero Codex]] (now [[Darmstadt]]), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian [[Lorsch Gospels]].  This is the first stylistic group of the traditional "'''Reichenau school'''".  The two other major manuscripts of the group are the [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]] named for [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] and [[Petershausen Sacramentary|Petershausen]].  In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above "we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134, quoted; Beckwith, 92–93; compare the St John portraits in [[:File:Gero Codex Evangelist Johannes.jpg|the Gero Codex]] and [[:File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|the Lorsch Gospels]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 005.jpg|thumb|left|the ''[[Annunciation to the shepherds]]'' from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], "Liuthar group" of the "Reichenau school"]]
A number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the [[Reichenau Island|island monastery of Reichenau]] in [[Lake Constance]], despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there.  C.R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at [[Lorsch]] and Trier instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130, with his full views in: C.R. Dodwell et [[D. H. Turner]] (eds.), ''Reichenau reconsidered. A Re-assessment of the Place of Reichenau in Ottonian Art'', 1965, Warburg Surveys, 2, of which Backhouse is a review.  See Backhouse, 98 for German scholars dubious about the traditional Reichenau school.  Garrison, 15, supports the traditional view.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wherever it was located, the "Reichenau school" specialized in [[gospel book]]s and other [[liturgical book]]s, many of them, such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]] (c. 1000) and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001–1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World]] International Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/illuminated-manuscripts-from-the-ottonian-period-produced-in-the-monastery-of-reichenau-lake-constance/ |title=Illuminated manuscripts from the Ottonian period produced in the monastery of Reichenau (Lake Constance) |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important "Reichenau school" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books.&lt;ref&gt;Or at any rate, monks depicted and named in them. Whether these would actually have been the main scribes of the text is discussed by Mayr-Harting, 229&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Eburnant group" covered above was followed by the "Ruodprecht group" named after the scribe of the [[Egbert Psalter]]; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The [[Liuthar Gospels|Aachen Gospels of Otto III]], also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third "'''Liuthar group'''" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–144; Backhouse, throughout, is rather sceptical about Trier as a major centre; Beckwith, 96–104 stresses the mobility of illuminators.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding miniaturist of the "Ruodprecht group" was the so-called Master of the ''[[Registrum Gregorii]]'', or [[Gregory Master]], whose work looked back in some respects to [[Late Antique]] manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for "their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 141–142, 141 quoted; Lasko, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; He worked chiefly in [[Trier]] in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential ''[[Codex Egberti]]'', a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop [[Egbert of Trier]], probably in the 980s.  However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–142&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the "Liuthar group" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it "carried transcendentalism to an extreme", with "marked schematization of the forms and colours", "flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 104, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them  "emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance", with narrative scenes "presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 108–110, both quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This gestural "dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277" /&gt;

The group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], the best known and most extreme of the group, where "the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 112&lt;/ref&gt; The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.

[[File:CodexAureusEpternacensisf76fDetail.jpg|thumb|Labourers in the vineyard, from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]]]]

Two dedication miniatures added to the [[Egmond Gospels]] around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style.  In [[Regensburg]] [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] held the major Carolingian [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which probably influenced a style with "an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page", giving in the [[Uta Codex]] of c. 1020 complex schemes where "bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism.  This style was to be very influential on [[Romanesque art]] in several media.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 151–153; Garrison, 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echternach Abbey]] became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] were produced there, followed by the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III]] in 1045–46, which Henry presented to [[Speyer Cathedral]] (now [[Escorial]]), the major work of the school.  Henry also commissioned the [[Uppsala Gospels]] for the cathedral there (now in the university library).&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at [[Salzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 153–15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hildesheim]], [[Corvey]], [[Fulda]], and [[Cologne]], where the [[Hitda Codex]] was made.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130–156 covers the whole period, as does Beckwith, 92–124; Legner's three volumes have catalogue entries on considerable numbers of manuscripts made in Cologne, or now located there.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork and enamels==
[[File:Nürnberg — GNM 2013-09-07 Mattes (101).JPG|thumb|A corner of the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], [[Trier]], 980s]]

Objects for decorating churches such as crosses, [[reliquaries]], altar frontals and [[treasure binding]]s for books were all made of or covered by gold, embellished with gems, enamels, crystals, and cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, Part Two (pp. 77–142), gives a very comprehensive account.  Beckwith, 138–145&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by "beehive" projections in gold wire, and figurative [[relief]]s in [[repoussé]] gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration.  Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94–95; Henderson, 15, 202–214; see Head for an analysis of the political significance of reliquaries commissioned by Egbert of Trier.&lt;/ref&gt; In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the [[Celestial city]], and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various "scientific", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular [[lapidary (text)|lapidary books]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] after he outgrew it.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94-95; also this [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/465119 brooch] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|[[Curmsun Disc]] - Obverse, Jomsborg, 980s]]
Examples of ''[[crux gemmata]]'' or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]; several abbesses of [[Essen Abbey]] were Ottonian princesses. The [[Cross of Otto and Mathilde]], [[Cross of Mathilde]] and the [[Essen cross with large enamels]] were probably all given by [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen]] (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the [[Theophanu Cross]] came some fifty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 99–109; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Lothair]] ([[Aachen]]) and [[Imperial Cross]] ([[Vienna]]) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]. The book cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] ([[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]]) is in a very comparable style.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 59–60; Lasko, 98; Beckwith, 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in [[Trier]],&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 15; Lasko, 96–98; Head.&lt;/ref&gt; and gold altar frontals for the [[Palace Chapel, Aachen]] and [[Basel Cathedral]] (now in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 129–131; Beckwith, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or [[Ambon of Henry II]]. The late Carolingian upper cover of the  [[Lindau Gospels]] ([[Morgan Library]], New York) and the [[Arnulf Ciborium]] in [[Munich]] were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64–66; Beckwith, 50, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christussäule 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wedding at Cana]] on the [[Bernward Column]]]]

Large objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving [[wheel chandelier]]s from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]] from the period of Bishop [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]] (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach "the peaks of perfection".  The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the [[Bernward Doors]], with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 111–123, 119 quoted; Beckwith, 145–149&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a bronze columnm the [[Bernward Column]], over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the [[ministry of Jesus]] in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of [[Trajan's Column]] and other Roman examples.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 120-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing [[cloisonné]] enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to [[Essen]].  During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the ''[[senkschmelz]]'' or "sunk enamel" technique in addition to the ''[[vollschmelz]]'' one already used.  Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use ''vollschmelz'', with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in ''senkschmelz'', surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed.  The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 95–106; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Christ Magdeburg Cathedral Met 41.100.157.jpg|thumb|The "dedication" [[Magdeburg]] plaque]]

Much very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites.  There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 126–138; Lasko, 78–79, 94, 106–108, 112, 131, as well as the passages cited below&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of four Ottonian ivory [[situla (vessel)|situlae]] appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period.  Situlae were [[liturgy|liturgical]] vessels used to hold [[holy water]], and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An [[aspergillum]] was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects.  However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of [[elephant]] tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops.  All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the [[Basilewsky]] Situla of 920 in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], decorated with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' on two levels,&lt;ref&gt;Basilewsky Situla [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93850/situla-the-basilewsky-situla/ V&amp;A Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Situla of Gotofredo" of c. 980 in [[Milan Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/56/m_483a78b657804fbaa6842929d8126c39.jpg image of Milan situla]&lt;/ref&gt; one in the [[Aachen Cathedral]] Treasury,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |title=Image of Aachen situla |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722075610/http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/euwf/ho_17.190.45.htm Metropolitan Museum example]&lt;/ref&gt;  All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop [[Gotofredo I (archbishop of Milan)|Gotfredus]] presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, 26, though Lasko, 92 disagrees with this.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops.  This was probably made in [[Trier]] about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;All except the New York situla are illustrated and discussed in Beckwith, pp. 129–130, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Among various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] and two [[diptych]] wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with "an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 133-136, 135-136 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important group of [[plaquette|plaques]], now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] and are called the "Magdeburg plaques", the "plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium" or similar names.  They were probably made in [[Milan]] in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an [[antependium]] or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed.  Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York has a "dedication" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral.  Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set.  The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold.  Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 87–91; Williamson, 12; Beckwith, 126–129. On the function of the original object, Williamson favours a door, Lasko leans towards a pulpit, and Beckwith an antependium, but none seem emphatic in their preference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style of the figures is described by [[Peter Lasko]] as "very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions".&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall painting==
[[File:Reichenau Oberzell Fresko1.jpeg|thumb|Jesus and the [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|Gadarene swine]], nave fresco in St George, [[Oberzell]]]]

Although it is clear from documentary records that many churches were decorated with extensive cycles of wall-painting, survivals are extremely rare, and more often than not fragmentary and in poor condition. Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around [[Fulda]] in [[Hesse]]; though there are also important examples from north Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 127–128; Beckwith, 88–92&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a record of bishop [[Gebhard of Constance]] hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of [[Petershausen Abbey]], and laymen may have dominated the art of wall-painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators.  The artists seem to have been rather mobile: "at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130; the Italian was "Johannes Italicus", who one scholar has identified with the Gregory Master, see Beckwith, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of St George at Oberzell on [[Reichenau Island]] has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration.  The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]]; they are therefore usually dated around 980–1000.  Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 128–130; Beckwith, 88–92; Backhouse, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Larger sculpture==
[[File:Gerokreuz full 20050903.jpg|thumb|[[Gero Cross]], c. 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]]]

Very little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the [[Gero Cross]] (around 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 142; Lauer, Rolf, in Legner, III, 142 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] (about 1000, [[Essen Cathedral]], which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the [[Virgin and Child]], which is in wood which was covered with [[gesso]] and then thin gold sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 150–152 Lasko, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Monumental sculpture]] remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the [[stucco]] reliefs on the [[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] of [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]], and also on that in [[San Pietro al Monte]], [[Civate]], which relate to ivory carving of the same period,&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 132&lt;/ref&gt; and some stone sculpture.

==Survival and historiography==
Surviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements.  As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Legner, Vol 2 pp. 238-240, no. E32, where a largely rubbed-down 6th-century Byzantine bookcover plaque has on the original back a Cologne relief of c. 1000 ([[Schnütgen Museum]], Inv. B 98).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;  A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods.  Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above.  Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries.

The term "Ottonian art" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524–525&lt;/ref&gt; apart from [[Adolph Goldschmidt]]'s studies of ivories and sculpture in general.  A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations.  The 1950 Munich exhibition ''Ars Sacra'' ("sacred art" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by [[Peter Lasko]] in his book for the ''[[Penguin Books#Pelican History of Art|Pelican History of Art]]'', the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the "minor arts", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524; Lasko, xxii lists a number of the exhibitions up to 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field "that is still significantly under-represented in English-language art-historical research".&lt;ref&gt;

'''PROPAGANDA''' is a large collection of [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]-licensed&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060915092439/https://olympus.het.brown.edu/cgi-bin/dwww?type=file&amp;location=/usr/share/doc/propaganda-debian/copyright PROPAGANDA license file] from its Debian package retrieved 2007-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; seamless [[Desktop environment|desktop]] backgrounds included in various [[Linux distribution]]s, and available via free download over the web. While no longer being produced or even officially hosted online, the collection consisted of approximately 15 volumes of largely abstract and surreal art, numbering over 1,000 images in total. Created in [[GIMP]] by Bowie J. Poag, the images were meant to attract users to the platform by virtue of the art having been 100% Linux-generated.

The style of the images produced by Poag were unusual in terms of their geometric qualities. Appearing to repeat seamlessly along all four edges, PROPAGANDA images became attractive for use in [[3D modeling]], and particularly for use as [[desktop wallpaper]], in that limitations in graphics hardware at the time often prevented users from using full screen 24-bit images. Using smaller, tileable images for desktop backgrounds helped keep memory utilization to a minimum, while still allowing early Linux desktops to be visually appealing.

After ten months, Poag turned control of the project over to Naru Sundar who was then a student at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. Although Sundar would subsequently release two additional volumes, Poag terminated the project in April 2000 citing a lack of activity by Sundar, and a falling out with Chris DiBona, a manager of community projects at [[VA Linux Systems]], who provided hosting space for his project.

As a side source of amusement, PROPAGANDA's website featured a satirical storyline that [[John F. Kennedy]] had faked his own assassination in 1963, and had placed himself into cryogenic suspension until the time was right to lead the charge against Microsoft, and help the Linux movement gain footing. While not greatly influential, Poag's work with PROPAGANDA led many to develop an interest in Linux as a platform during its formative early years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=propaganda Everything2 node] by ''Toastie'', retrieved 2007-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pure Pwnage''''' (pronounced "pure ownage")&lt;ref name="pwn"&gt;The word "pwnage" can be pronounced several different ways. The show's creators pronounce it "ownage". Jeremy justifies this pronunciation with the following statements: "When people say [[Pwn|{{IPA|/ˈpoʊn/}}]], they sound like a complete fag, and I'm not cool with being a fag, so I pronounce it {{IPA|/ˈoʊn/}}." {{" '}}Pwn' was originally a typo of 'own', because the 'P' is near the 'O' on the keyboard. The person is still trying to say 'own'." [TeamSpeak chat, December 13, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
was a Canadian [[web series|Internet-distributed]], [[mockumentary]] series from ROFLMAO Productions.  The fictional series purports to chronicle the life and adventures of Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale), a [[Canadians|Canadian]] and self-proclaimed "[[pro gamer]]".  In 2010, an adaptation of the web series began airing on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]], a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[cable television]] [[specialty channel|channel]], but the series failed to be picked up for a second season.

== Premise ==
Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale) also known as "teh_pwnerer" is extremely proficient at [[video games]] but inexperienced when it comes to [[Norm (sociology)|normal social interactions]].  Jeremy is only interested in "[[pwn]]ing [[noob|n00bs]]" and making it as a [[pro gamer]] and often comes off as lazy and narcissistic to other people.  Kyle (played by Geoff Lapaire) is Jeremy's brother and an aspiring film-maker.  Kyle decides to film a documentary of Jeremy's exploits as a [[gamer]] and his interactions with the gaming and non-gaming world. In 2012, it was announced that the crew are making a Pure Pwnage film with funding by their fans.

== History ==
''Pure Pwnage'' was created by Geoff Lapaire and Jarett Cale who also play the show's main protagonists.  Originating in 2004, eighteen Internet-distributed episodes of the series have been released to date. In 2007, the series creators estimated their current viewer base to be over three million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Infancy of Internet Television | author = Geoff Lapaire | publisher = Pure Pwnage | url = http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215065150/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is filmed primarily in [[Toronto]], Ontario, but has also included scenes filmed in [[Calgary]], Alberta; [[Montreal]], Quebec; [[Aurora, Ontario]]; [[Hamilton, Ontario]]; and the [[Netherlands]].

During an interview, director Geoff Lapaire (although as "Kyle"; Lapaire maintained his "Kyle" identity among fans and media) insisted that all of the characters on the show are not acting.&lt;ref name="teamspeak"&gt;Starting with Episode 8, the ''Pure Pwnage'' cast and crew hold a public [[TeamSpeak]] interview soon after the release of each episode, revealing many details about the show and the personalities involved in its creation. The recordings of each episode are linked in a [http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010003/http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 |date=2007-09-27 }} on the forums.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the personalities on ''Pure Pwnage'' display their true-to-life abilities and eccentricities, and the characters took great pains to maintain that the ''Pure Pwnage'' world is simply an extension of the real world. Lapaire has finally admitted that they are in fact actors. The sixth fanchat with the crew was out-of-character, where the fact that the characters within ''Pure Pwnage'' are exaggerated versions of the actors was confirmed.

On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV6cjKxZFOM&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the announcement, many members of the ''Pure Pwnage'' fan community raised concerns. The main complaints were that the series was only announced to be airing in Canada, and the assumption that it would be changed in order to appeal to viewers not familiar with [[internet culture]]. Jarett Cale, who writes the show and plays Jeremy, tried to quell the complaints on the ''Pure Pwnage'' forums, saying "We're doing our best to get it broadcast in the USA, UK, Australia, etc., but it's really up to each country's respective broadcasters. ''[...]'' Geoff and I are still the main creative force&amp;nbsp;– we're producers and writers. We've also brought on many new people with experience in traditional television to help us out both story-wise and production-wise. FPS Doug will still be there, and he will still be played by Joel Gardiner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92459&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1770140 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-08-06 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a user asking if the TV series meant there would be no more web episodes, he said "Nope, it only means there's a new TV series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92541&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1772872 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2008-08-10 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the future of the web series was uncertain. Geoff Lapaire, director of all previous episodes of ''Pure Pwnage'', left the show in September 2008 to focus on the then-unannounced TV series, and Troy Dixon, who played T-Bag in the series, died in a car accident on December 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=84552&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1600457 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |date=2008-12-09 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarett Cale announced in January 2009 that work on the next web episode had begun, with him as the director, however the episode has not been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' news post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-01-27 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025702/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |archivedate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short Livestream cast on March 15, 2010, a user posted a comment regarding the web series and Jarett replied that the web series is back in production and is in progress. He has not given out an ETA.

On January 19, 2011, Jarett made an announcement on the Pure Pwnage forums that the TV series had not been picked up for a second season. Additionally, the web series has been put on indefinite hold. In his own words, "My hope that Pure Pwnage will see a proper ending to its illustrious web series has nearly vanished. I've let Geoff know that should he be willing at any time to resume some of his traditional, critical roles on the web series I will fly home to Toronto in a heartbeat to help make it happen."

On September 18, 2012 The Pure Pwnage YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "010100100100010101010100010101010101001001001110" which is a binary encoding of the word "Return", signalling the return of the Pure Pwnage.

==Pure Pwnage Teh Movie==
On September 19, 2012, an official [[crowd funding]] campaign was announced to aid in the funding of a Pure Pwnage movie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiegogo.com/purepwnage&lt;/ref&gt; The $75,000 goal was raised in just over 24 hours, due to overwhelming support from fans all over the world. At the end of the campaign, a total of $211,300 was raised.

On November 22, 2015, the official trailer was released. The movie premiered in Toronto on January 23, 2016 at the Bloor Cinema. Further screenings took place around the US and in the UK.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download via Vimeo.

=== Reception and awards ===
Pure Pwnage Teh Movie received the Canadian Comedy Awards 2016 award for best feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadiancomedyawards.org/awards.php|title=Awards {{!}} Canadian Comedy Awards|website=canadiancomedyawards.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well-received by general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lapaire|first=Geoff|title=Pure Pwnage|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4682866/|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-offs ==

=== TV series ===
On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|title=Pure Pwnage announcement: "Project X Revealed"|publisher=ROFLMAO Productions|accessdate=2009-08-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811220757/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|archivedate=2009-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made in the form of a mini-episode where Kyle tries to convince Jeremy to stop playing on his [[Nintendo DS Lite]] and make the announcement. The series had been teased for several months under the name "Project X". The TV series premiered on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] March 12, 2010, and premiered on Australia's [[ABC2]] on October 4, 2010. According to creator Jarett Cale, the TV series itself takes place in a fictional world within the Pure Pwnage universe (webseries) where Kyle ironically got a TV series, thus explaining the lack of consistency between shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/201010/programs/ZX1389A001D2010-10-04T210600.htm?program=Pure%20Pwnage|title=Pure Pwnage - Life Of A Pro Gamer|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeremy's Mail Sac ===
Starting in March 2010, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website began letting fans send Jeremy questions via e-mail.  Jeremy then answered the fan questions in video segments posted on the website titled, ''Jeremy's Mail Sac''.

=== Pro at Cooking ===
{{Main|Pro at Cooking}}
Starring Dave (Dawei) as himself, ''Pro at Cooking'' is a spin-off of ''Pure Pwnage''. A cooking show for gamers with Dave hosting as the main chef. When his female assistants do not perform as expected, Dave constantly fires each one of them usually after every episode. Directed by Davin, it has only aired seven 5- to 10-minute episodes. No other characters from ''Pure Pwnage'', excluding Dave, Davin, and Geoff, appear on the show.

=== ''Pure Pwnage: The Comic'' ===
From February 28, 2006 to March 7, 2007, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website featured a regularly issued comic, of which a new page was released once every two to three weeks. Apparently set in the "real world" rather than in the fictional world of ''Pure Pwnage'', the comic breaks most of the [[fourth wall]] of the show. For example, Dave said in the show that he was leaving it due to unfinished business in China, the comic claims that the real reason was that he had found a new job in [[Vancouver]].

However, both the show and comic clearly contain elements that are either symbolic representations of reality (for example, [[pwn]]ing an opponent with "micro balls" as a possible metaphor for pwning them in an actual video game) or are not based in reality whatsoever.

=== Pure Pwnage: Teh Movie ===
In September 2012, series creators Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire announced an indiegogo campaign to raise funds for a Pure Pwnage feature-length film. Within 24 hours of the campaign being launched, the project had received their goal of $75,000, and by the end of the campaign, they had reached a total of $211,300. Despite this being a relatively small film budget, Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire have said that with their experience of making the web series with an extremely limited amount of funds, they are confident that they would be able to make a quality film shot in countries across the world, mentioning hopes of filming in South Korea. Pre-production began in earnest in early 2013, with weekly twitch.tv livestreams in which Lapaire, Cale, and guests such as Joel Gardiner (fps_doug) and Miranda Plant (Tagi) discuss the film and interact with fans.

The film premiered on January 23, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario. Following this, Cale and Lapaire took the film to the road, screening the project around the world in a touring limited release.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download on Vimeo.

'''Sanganakallu''' ({{Lang-kn | ಸಂಗನಕಲ್ಲು  }}) is an ancient archaeological site from the Neolithic period (circa 3000 BC). It is approximately 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bellary]] in [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is a group of hills south of a horseshoe shaped valley, with Kupgal to the north.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stone Age Cultures of Bellary|last=Subbarao|first=Bendapudi|publisher=Dr. S.

* Pre-[[Mesolithic]], the phase when Sanganakallu was first settled, had little pottery, and the people made crude [[Microlith|microliths]].
* [[Mesolithic]], the phase when pottery was handmade and stone axes were mass produced.
* [[Neolithic]], the phase when pottery and tools became more sophisticated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
Sanganakallu was excavated again in 1964.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Excavation at Sangankallu, 1964-65|last=Ansari|first=Zainuddin|last2=Rao|first2=M. S.|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=Poona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
The earliest tools excavated were hundreds of [[patinated]] [[Lithic flake|flakes]] made of [[basalt]], and [[quartz]] [[Lithic flake|flakes]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In the later Mesolithic phase is when tool making became more abundant.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Stone axes, [[Hammerstone|hammer stones]], [[Chisel|chisels]], picks, slick-stones, and [[Sling (weapon)|sling stones]] were excavated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The axes were found in many different shapes. There were oval shaped, triangular shaped, or rectangular shaped axes and some were axes were rounded and some were thin.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The sheer number of [[Microlith|microliths]] is the reason Sanganakallu is considered a factory site.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Pottery ==
The first pottery started showing up in Mesolithic phase. The pottery was usually dull brown or black, and hand-made out of course clay.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Pale-gray pots made of fine clay mixed with [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[mica]] were also excavated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The pottery from the later [[Megalith|Neolithic]] period were more fine, thin, and polished.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They were all burnt and wheel turned.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The ornamental pottery was decorated in a finger groove pattern and a few shards were found painted purple.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A few pots were perforated and the significance of that is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== 1964 excavation ==
In this excavation, a one room Neolithic circular house was excavated.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The wall was made with bamboo and clay and the floor was covered in potholes.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There was a hearth in the center of the house, and there is evidence of it being burned.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Other than the house structure, a few [[terracotta]] figurines in the shape of birds or bulls were also found as well as more [[Stone tool|stone tools]] and pottery.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Animal remains were also collected, the majority of which were cow bones.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Earliest agriculturists==
The people who settled at Sanganakallu were early agriculturists, who cultivated small [[Millet|millets]] and [[Legume|pulses]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They kept sheep, cattle, and had separate areas for dumping dung ([[Neolithic ashmounds (India)|ash mounds]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Saturn Devouring His Son''''' is the name given to a painting by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco Goya]]. According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of the [[titans (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]] (in the title Romanized to [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]), who, fearing that he would be overthrown by one of his children,&lt;ref&gt;"These great Cronos swallowed as each came forth from the womb to his mother's knees with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst the deathless gods. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, strong though he was, through the contriving of great Zeus." - Hesiod {{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm|title= Theogony |publisher=Sacred-Texts.com |accessdate=2013-08-25 |date=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[filicide|ate each one]] upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 ''[[Black Paintings]]'' that Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] after Goya's death and has since been held in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].

==Background==
[[File:Quinta del Sordo 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Quinta del Sordo, c. 1900]]
In 1819, Goya purchased a house on the banks of [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]] near Madrid called [[Quinta del Sordo]] (Villa of the Deaf Man). It was a two-story house which was named after a previous occupant who had been deaf, although the name was fitting for Goya too, who had been left deaf after contracting a fever in 1792. Between 1819 and 1823, when he left the house to move to [[Bordeaux]], Goya produced a series of 14 works, which he painted with [[oil painting|oils]] directly onto the walls of the house. At the age of 73, and having survived two life-threatening illnesses, Goya was likely to have been concerned with his own mortality, and was increasingly embittered by the [[Trienio Liberal|civil strife]] occurring in Spain. Although he initially decorated the rooms of the house with more inspiring images, in time he overpainted them all with the intensely haunting pictures known today as the ''Black Paintings''. Uncommissioned and never meant for public display, these pictures reflect his darkening mood with some tense scenes of malevolence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;"But never before and never since, as far as we know, has a major, ambitious cycle of paintings been painted with the intention of keeping the pictures an entirely private affair." Licht, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturn Devouring His Son'', a disturbing portrait of the titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold that one of the sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, [[Caelus]]. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife [[Ops]] eventually hid his third son, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], on the island of [[Crete]], deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in swaddling in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.

Goya never named the works he produced at Quinta del Sordo; the names were assigned by others after his death,&lt;ref name="Licht, 168"&gt;Licht, 168&lt;/ref&gt; and this painting is also known as just ''Saturn'', ''Saturn Devouring One of His Sons'', ''Saturn Devouring his Children'' or by the Spanish names ''Saturno devorando a su hijo'' or ''Saturno devorando a un hijo''.

Goya depicts Saturn feasting upon one of his sons. His child's head and part of the left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has probably been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge widely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers into the back of the body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis,&lt;ref&gt;Morden and Pulimood in Farthing, 375&lt;/ref&gt; but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Peter Paul Rubens]]' more [[Baroque]]-style ''[[Saturn (Rubens)|Saturn Devouring His Son]]'' (1636) may have inspired [[Goya]].]]
Various interpretations of the meaning of the picture have been offered: the conflict between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution. There have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son, Xavier, the only of his six children to survive to adulthood, or with his live-in housekeeper and possible mistress, Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed cannot be determined with certainty. If Goya made any notes on the picture, they have not survived; as he never intended the picture for public exhibition, he probably had little interest in explaining its significance. It has been said that the painting is "essential to our understanding of the human condition in modern times, just as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] is essential to understanding the tenor of the 16th century".&lt;ref&gt;Licht, 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Goya may have been inspired by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]' 1636 [[Saturn (Rubens)|picture of the same name]]. Rubens' painting, also held at the Museo del Prado, is a brighter, more conventional treatment of the myth: his Saturn exhibits less of the [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] ferocity portrayed in Goya's rendition. However, some critics have suggested that Rubens' portrayal is the more horrific: the god is portrayed as a calculating remorseless killer, who – fearing for his own position of power&amp;nbsp;– murders his innocent child. Goya's vision, on the other hand, shows a man driven mad by the act of killing his own son. Or it could be interpreted as a titan driven wild with fear at the idea of usurpation from one of his children.  In addition, the body of the son in Goya's picture is that of an adult, not the helpless baby depicted by Rubens. Goya had produced a chalk drawing of the same subject in 1796-7 that was closer in tone to Rubens' work: it showed a Saturn similar in appearance to that of Rubens', daintily biting on the leg of one of his sons while he holds another like a leg of chicken, with none of the gore or madness of the later work.  Goya scholar Fred Licht has raised doubts regarding the traditional title however, noting that the classical iconographical attributes associated with Saturn are absent from the painting, and the body of the smaller figure does not resemble that of an infant.&lt;ref name="Licht, 168"/&gt; The rounded buttocks and wide hips of the headless corpse has also called into question the identification of this figure as a male.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfer from the Quinta del Sordo==
Although they were not meant to be seen by the public, the paintings remain important works in Goya's oeuvre. When Goya went into self-imposed exile in France in 1823, he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson, Mariano. After various changes of ownership, the house came into the possession of the Belgian Baron [[Frédéric Emile d'Erlanger|Emile d'Erlanger]] in 1874. After 70 years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo, the murals were deteriorating badly and, in order to preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas under the direction of [[Salvador Martínez Cubells]], the chief art restorer at the Museo del Prado. After showing them at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1878 in Paris, d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state. The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail may have been lost, but in this respect ''Saturn Devouring His Son'' appears to have fared better than some of the other works.

==Notes==
{{reflist|30em}}
Guillermo del Toro's ''Pan's Labyrinth'' (2006) models a monster-character, the Pale Man, after the Saturn who devoured his children. On the walls of the Pale Man's subterranean lair, a replica of the worldside banquet table of the monstrous Captain Vidal, whose inner self the Pale Man represents, are paintings of the Pale Man murdering children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">Many organizations have used [[sticker]]s to publicize their philosophy or cause. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), which during its colorful history has [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|pioneered a variety of creative tactics]], calls its stickers '''silent agitators''', or '''silent organizers'''. Professor [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]] has written about the history of such media,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wobbly organizers were revolutionary fish swimming in the sea of [[bindle]] stiffs and [[Hobo|tramp]] workers. The Wobbly card was a ticket to ride the rails. "Side door coaches," as box cars were called, were plastered with paper stickers, "silent organizers," that Wobs put up everywhere they passed: "Join the One Big Union," "I Will Win," "Win a World." &lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]], pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Silent agitators were produced by the millions.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Margolis described the way such stickers were used when the Wobblies [[Columbine Mine massacre|called a strike]] in 1927:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bill Lloyd, Superintendent at the Puritan Mine (in [[Colorado]]'s northern coal field), went to work one chilly Autumn morning to discover Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place: "Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies," he said indignantly, "From the bottom of the shaft clear to the working faces, see, they had these posters."&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. Eric Margolis, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers to propagandize against [[World War I|the war]]. The stickers declared, "Don't be a soldier, be a man. Join the I.W.W. and fight on the job for yourself and [[Working class|your class]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Situationists|image=|caption=Situationists [[Michèle Bernstein]], [[Guy Debord]], and [[Asger Jorn]] in 1957. In this year, the Situationist International was founded, and its manifesto, [[Report on the Construction of Situations]], was published. |all}}

The '''Situationist International''' ('''SI''') was an [[Proletarian internationalism|international]] organization of social revolutionaries made up of [[avant-garde]] [[artist]]s, [[intellectual]]s, and [[Political philosophy|political theorists]], prominent in Europe from its formation in 1957 to its dissolution in 1972.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"&gt;{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual foundations of the Situationist International were derived primarily from [[Libertarian Marxism|anti-authoritarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde [[art movement]]s of the early 20th century, particularly [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Overall, situationist theory represented an attempt to synthesize this diverse field of theoretical disciplines into a modern and comprehensive critique of mid-20th century [[advanced capitalism]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The situationists recognized that [[capitalism]] had changed since [[Marx]]'s formative writings, but maintained that his analysis of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] remained fundamentally correct; they rearticulated and expanded upon several [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] concepts, such as his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; In their expanded interpretation of [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], the situationists asserted that the misery of [[Marx's theory of alienation|social alienation]] and [[commodity fetishism]] were no longer limited to the fundamental components of capitalist society, but had now in advanced capitalism spread themselves to every aspect of life and culture.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; They rejected the idea that advanced capitalism's apparent successes—such as technological advancement, increased income, and increased leisure—could ever outweigh the social dysfunction and degradation of everyday life that it simultaneously inflicted.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;

Essential to situationist theory was the concept of [[Spectacle (critical theory)|the spectacle]], a unified critique of [[advanced capitalism]] of which a primary concern was the progressively increasing tendency towards the expression and mediation of [[social relation]]s through [[Commodity (Marxism)|objects]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The situationists believed that the shift from individual expression through directly lived experiences, or the first-hand fulfillment of authentic desires, to individual expression by proxy through the exchange or [[Consumption (sociology)|consumption]] of [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]], or passive second-hand alienation, inflicted significant and far-reaching damage to the quality of human life for both individuals and society.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Another important concept of situationist theory was the primary means of counteracting the spectacle; the construction of situations, moments of life deliberately constructed for the purpose of reawakening and pursuing authentic desires, experiencing the feeling of life and adventure, and the liberation of everyday life.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''.

When the Situationist International was first formed, it had a predominantly artistic focus; emphasis was placed on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]].&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; Gradually, however, that focus shifted more towards revolutionary and political theory.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt; The Situationist International reached the apex of its creative output and influence in 1967 and 1968, with the former marking the publication of the two most significant texts of the situationist movement, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]] and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. The expressed writing and political theory of the two aforementioned texts, along with other situationist publications, proved greatly influential in shaping the ideas behind the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 insurrections in France]]; quotes, phrases, and slogans from situationist texts and publications were ubiquitous on posters and graffiti throughout France during the uprisings.&lt;ref name="Plant1992TheMost"/&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "situationist" refers to the construction of situations, one of the early central concepts of the Situationist International; the term also refers to any individuals engaged in the construction of situations, or, more narrowly, to members of the Situationist International.&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/definitions.html Definitions]''. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Situationist theory sees the situation as a tool for the liberation of everyday life, a method of negating the pervasive [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] that accompanied the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]. The founding manifesto of the Situationist International, ''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957), defined the construction of situations as "the concrete construction of momentary ambiances of life and their transformation into a superior [[wikt:passional#Adjective|passional]] quality."&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; ''Internationale Situationniste'' #1 (June 1958) defined the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a [[wikt:unitary#Adjective|unitary]] [[wikt:ambiance#Noun|ambiance]] and a game of events".&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The situationists argued that [[advanced capitalism]] manufactured false desires; literally in the sense of [[Mass media|ubiquitous advertising]] and the glorification of [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]], and more broadly in the abstraction and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of the more ephemeral experiences of authentic life into [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]]. The experimental direction of situationist activity consisted of setting up temporary environments favorable to the fulfillment of true and authentic human desires in response.&lt;ref name="PreliminarySituations"&gt;Guy Debord (1958) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/problems.html Preliminary Problems in Constructing a Situation]''. Internationale Situationniste #1 (Paris, June 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Situationist International strongly resisted use of the term "situationism", which Debord called a "meaningless term", adding "[t]here is no such thing as situationism, which would mean a doctrine for interpreting existing conditions".&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The situationists maintained a philosophical opposition to all [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideologies]], conceiving of them as abstract [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] ultimately serving only to justify the [[Base and superstructure|economic base]] of a given society; accordingly, they rejected "situationism" as an absurd and self-contradictory concept.&lt;ref name="Vaneigem1967Revolution1"&gt;Raoul Vaneigem (1967) ''[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/35 Traité du savoir-vivre à l’usage des jeunes générations]''. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter 1: The Insignificant Signified.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', Debord asserted ideology was "the abstract will to universality and the illusion thereof" which was "legitimated in modern society by universal abstraction and by the effective dictatorship of illusion".&lt;ref name="Debord1967SocietyIX"&gt;

==History==

===Origins (1945–1955)===
The situationist movement had its origins as a left wing tendency within [[Lettrism]],&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |title=Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958) |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; an artistic and literary movement led by the Romanian-born French poet and visual artist [[Isidore Isou]], originating in 1940s Paris. The group was heavily influenced by the preceding [[avant-garde]] movements of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]], seeking to apply critical theories based on these concepts to all areas of art and culture, most notably in [[poetry]], [[film]], [[painting]] and [[political theory]].&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; Among some of the concepts and artistic innovations developed by the Lettrists were the ''lettrie'', a [[poetry|poem]] reflecting pure form yet devoid of all semantic content, new syntheses of writing and visual art identified as [[metagraphics]] and [[hypergraphics]], as well as new creative techniques in [[filmmaking]]. Future situationist [[Guy Debord]], who was at that time a significant figure in the Lettrist movement, helped develop these new film techniques, using them in his Lettrist film ''[[Howls for Sade]]'' (1952) as well as later in his situationist film ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1972).

By 1950, a much younger and more [[left-wing]] part of the Lettrist movement began to emerge. This group kept very active in perpetrating public outrages such as the [[Notre-Dame Affair]], where at the [[Easter]] High Mass at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], in front of ten thousand people and broadcast on national TV, their member and former Dominican Michel Mourre posed as a [[monk]], "stood in front of the altar and read a pamphlet proclaiming that God was dead".&lt;ref name="Horn07p8"&gt;Horn (2007), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcus89p279-86"&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] (1989) ''[[Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVAoeipLL38C preview] at Google books, pp. 279–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=To have done with the judgment of God |author= |url=http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-11-13 |publisher=Snarkout |date=2002-11-24 |accessdate=2008-06-23 |df= }}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=COSTRUIRE L'UNITA' D'AREA/2 | author=Adriano Scianca | url=http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 | publisher=miro renzaglia | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2008-06-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928042757/http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 | archivedate=2007-09-28 | df= }}{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Breton]] prominently came out in solidarity with the action in a letter that spawned a large debate in the newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''.&lt;ref name="Boucharenc05"&gt;Boucharenc, Myriam (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKf2PLK1BgC ''L'universel reportage''], pp. 94–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breton50NotreDame"&gt;[[André Breton|Breton, André]] (1950) [http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-le-scandale-de-notre-dame-41681161.html ''Lettre a Louis Pauwels" sur le «"scandale" de Notre Dame»''], in ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', April 12, 1950, ''OC III'', pp. 1024–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, this left wing of the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] movement, which included Debord, broke off from Isou's group and formed the [[Letterist International]], a new Paris-based collective of avant-garde artists and political theorists. The schism finally erupted when the future members of the radical{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Lettrists disrupted a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference for ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]]. They distributed a [[polemic]] entitled "No More Flat Feet!", which concluded: "The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin."&lt;ref name="Berna1952No"&gt;Serge Berna, Jean-Louis Brau, Guy Debord &amp; Gil J. Wolman (1952) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/flatfeet.html No More Flat Feet!]''. Internationale Lettriste #1 (Paris, November 1952). Translated by Ken Knabb. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Isou was upset with this, his own attitude being that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that his work was no longer relevant, while having appreciated it "in its own time," and asserted their belief "that the most urgent expression of freedom is the destruction of idols, especially when they claim to represent freedom," in this case, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin.&lt;ref name="1952Position"&gt;(1952) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/position.html Position of the Lettrist International]''. Internationale Lettriste #1 (Paris, November 1952). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of the [[Letterist International]], many of the important concepts and ideas that would later be integral in situationist theory were developed. Individuals in the group collaboratively constructed the new field of [[psychogeography]], which they defined as "the study of the specific effects of the [[geography|geographical environment]] (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1955Introduction"&gt;Guy Debord (1955) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography]''. Les Lèvres Nues #6 (Paris, September 1955). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Debord further expanded this concept of psychogeography with his theory of the [[dérive]], an unplanned tour through an [[city|urban]] landscape directed entirely by the feelings evoked in the individual by their surroundings, serving as the primary means for mapping and investigating the psychogeography of these different areas.&lt;ref name="Debord1956Theory"&gt;Guy Debord (1956) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/geography.html Theory of the Dérive]''. Les Lèvres Nues #9 (Paris, November 1956). Reprinted in Internationale Situationniste #2 (Paris, December 1958). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Letterist International also developed the situationist tactic of [[détournement]], which by reworking or re-contextualizing an existing work of art or literature sought to radically shift its meaning to one with revolutionary significance.

===Formation (1956–1957)===

In 1956, Guy Debord, a member of the [[Lettrist International]], and [[Asger Jorn]] of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], brought together a group of artistic collectives for the ''First World Congress of Free Artists'' in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Horn07p5-7"&gt;Horn (2007), pp. 5–7, 42&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting established the foundation for the development of the Situationist International, which was officially formed in July 1957 at a meeting in Cosio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beach Beneath the Street: The Everyday Life and Glorious Times of the Situationist International|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|date=2011-06-20|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=9781844677207|edition=1|location=|pages=67|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting International was a fusion of these extremely small [[avant-garde]] collectives: the [[Lettrist International]], the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] (an offshoot of [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]), and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] (though, Anselm Jappe has argued that the group pivoted around Jorn and Debord for the first four years).&lt;ref name="Jappe99DebordJorn"&gt;[[Anselm Jappe]], 1999, p. 65 quotation: :''For the first four years of the SI's existence, the pivot of the group was the collaboration between Debord and Asger Jorn, who complemented each other well precisely because they were so different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the Situationist International drew ideas from other groups such as ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The most prominent member of the group, [[Guy Debord]], generally became considered the organization's [[de facto]] leader and most distinguished theorist. Other members included theorist [[Raoul Vaneigem]], the Dutch painter [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]], the Italo-Scottish writer [[Alexander Trocchi]], the English artist [[Ralph Rumney]] (sole member of the London Psychogeographical Association, Rumney suffered expulsion relatively soon after the formation), the Danish artist [[Asger Jorn]] (who after parting with the SI also founded the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]]), the architect and veteran of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] [[Attila Kotanyi]], and the French writer [[Michele Bernstein]]. Debord and Bernstein later married.

In June 1957, Debord wrote the [[manifesto]] of the Situationist International, titled ''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]''. This manifesto plans a systematic{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} rereading of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and advocates a cultural revolution in [[western countries]].&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"&gt;Guy Debord (1957) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/report.html Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's Conditions of Organization and Action]''. (Paris, June 1957). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic period (1958–1962)===
[[File:Asger Jorn (1963) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danes|Danish]] painter, sculptor, [[ceramic art]]ist, and author [[Asger Jorn]], founding member of the Situationist International.]]

During the first few years of the SI's founding, [[avant-garde]] artistic groups began collaborating with the SI and joining the organization. [[Gruppe SPUR]], a [[Germans|German]] artistic collective, collaborated with the Situationist International on projects beginning in 1959, continuing until the group officially joined the SI in 1961. The role of the artists in the SI was of great significance, particularly [[Asger Jorn]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Pinot Gallizio]].&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"/&gt;

Asger Jorn, who invented [[Situgraphy]] and [[Situlogy]], had the social role of catalyst and team leader among the members of the SI between 1957 and 1961. Jorn's role in the situationist movement (as in [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]]) was that of a catalyst and team leader. [[Guy Debord]] on his own lacked the personal warmth and persuasiveness to draw people of different nationalities and talents into an active working partnership. As a prototype [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[intellectual]] Debord needed an ally who could patch up the petty egoisms and squabbles of the members. When Jorn's leadership was withdrawn in 1961, many simmering quarrels among different sections of the SI flared up, leading to multiple exclusions.
[[File:Internationale situationniste nº1.jpg|thumb|left|''Internationale situationniste'']]
The first major split was the exclusion of Gruppe SPUR, the German section, from the SI on February 10, 1962.&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"&gt;(1963) ''[http://www.notbored.org/spur-exclusion.html The Exclusion of the Spurists]''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; Many different disagreements led to the fracture, for example; while at the Fourth SI Conference in London in December, 1960, in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, the Gruppe SPUR members disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a [[revolutionary proletariat]];&lt;ref name="SI5Conf4"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/london.html The Fourth SI Conference in London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905181622/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/london.html |date=2008-09-05 }}'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/5.conf4.htm] Internationale Situationniste #5 (December 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; the accusation that their activities were based on a "systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses";&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"/&gt; the understanding that at least one Gruppe SPUR member, [[sculptor]] [[Lothar Fischer]], and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to achieve success in the [[Economics of the arts and literature|art market]].&lt;ref name="1963TheExclusion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunzelmann"&gt;''[http://www.kurr.org/t_nothing.php Nothing to talk about] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105221228/http://www.kurr.org/t_nothing.php |date=2009-01-05 }} key, Halil Altindere and Sezgin Boynik (editors)&lt;/ref&gt; the betrayal, in the ''Spur #7'' issue, of a common agreement on the Gruppe SPUR and SI publications.{{fragment|date=July 2013}}&lt;ref name="SI7Conf5"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/goteborg.html The Fifth SI Conference in Göteborg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029073104/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/goteborg.html |date=2010-10-29 }}'',[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/7.conf5.htm] Internationale Situationniste #7 (April 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DebordVernissage150362"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-15March1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord and [[Uwe Lausen]] to the journal ''Vernissage'', 15 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusion was a recognition that [[Gruppe SPUR]]'s "principles, methods and goals" were significantly in contrast with those of the SI.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord180662"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-18June1962.html Letter] from [[Guy Debord]] to [[Rodolphe Gasche]] (member of the Gruppe SPUR), 18 June 1962&lt;/ref&gt; This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to Gruppe SPUR, calling it the only significant artist group in [[Germany]] since [[World War II]], and regarding it at the level of the [[avant-garde]]s in other countries.&lt;ref name="DebordSpur280462"&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-28April1962.html Letter] from Guy Debord To the Spur group, 28 April 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant split was in 1962, wherein the "Nashists," the [[Scandinavia]]n section of the SI led by [[Jørgen Nash]], were excluded from the organization for lacking the theoretical rigor demanded by the [[France|Franco]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] section of SI led by Guy Debord. This excluded group would later declare themselves the [[2nd Situationist International]], basing their organization out of [[Sweden]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Journalist [[Stewart Home]], who favored the "Nashists" and considered Debord a "mystic, an idealist, a dogmatist and a liar"&lt;ref name="Jappe1999"&gt;[[Anselm Jappe]] (1999) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rfguCi3qQasC Guy Debord]'', p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that while the 2nd Situationist International sought to challenge the separation of [[art and politics]] from everyday life, Debord and the so-called 'specto-situationists'&lt;ref name="AssaultOnCultureCh8"&gt;Stewart Home (1987) ''[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/sithree.htm The Assault on Culture Chapter 8 – The Decline and Fall of the Specto-Situationist Critique]''.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to concentrate solely on theoretical political aims.&lt;ref name="Kurczynski2005Beyond"&gt;[[Karen Kurczynski]] (2005) ''[http://members.chello.nl/j.seegers1/situationist/bib_jorn.html#criticism Beyond Expressionism: Asger Jorn and the European Avant-Garde, 1941–1961]'' (New York University: New York 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political period (1963–1968)===

By this point the Situationist International consisted almost exclusively of the Franco-Belgian section, led by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]]. These members possessed much more of a tendency towards political theory over the more artistic aspects of the SI. The shift in the intellectual priorities within the SI resulted in more focus on the theoretical, such as the [[Spectacle (Situationism)|theory of the spectacle]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] critical analysis, spending much less time on the more artistic and tangible concepts like [[unitary urbanism]], [[détournement]], and [[situgraphy]].&lt;ref name="Blissett2002Guy"&gt;Luther Blissett (2002) ''[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/pub_contents/9 Guy Debord Is Really Dead]''&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period the SI began having more and more influence on local university students in [[France]]. Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", situationist-influenced students, infiltrated the [[University of Strasbourg]]'s [[Student activity center|student union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Plant | first=Sadie | title=The Most Radical Gesture | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-415-06222-0 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"&gt;{{cite book | last=Vague | first=Tom | title=Anarchy in the Uk: the Angry Brigade | publisher=AK Press | location=Stirling | year=1997 | isbn=978-1-873176-98-6 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first action was to form an "[[social anarchism|anarchist]] appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for [[Karl Marx]] and [[Ravachol]]; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of [[the Durruti Column]]", [[Andre Bertrand]]'s ''[[détournement|détourned]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt; They then invited the situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]'', written by [[Tunisia]]n situationist [[Mustapha/Omar Khayati]] was the result.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt; The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the [[academic year]]. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.&lt;ref name="Vague1997Anarchy"/&gt;

Quoted in [[René Viénet]] (1968) ''Enragés et situationnistes dans le mouvement des occupations'' (Paris: Gallimard)&lt;/ref&gt;

They also made up the majority in the [[Sorbonne Occupation Committee|Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt; An important event leading up to May 1968 was the scandal in Strasbourg in December 1966.&lt;ref name="Viénet68sec1"&gt;[[René Viénet]] (1968) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/enrages.html Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement]'' (Translated by Loren Goldner and Paul Sieveking, New York: Autonomedia, 1992), sec.1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union Nationale des Étudiants de France]] declared itself in favor of the SI's theses, and managed to use public funds to publish [[Mustapha Khayati]]'s pamphlet ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mustapha Khayati (November 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of copies of the pamphlet were printed and circulated and helped to make the Situationists well known throughout the nonstalinist left.

Quotations from two key situationist books, Debord's ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) and Khayati's ''On the Poverty of Student Life'' (1966), were written on the walls of Paris and several provincial cities.&lt;ref name="Viénet68sec1" /&gt; This was documented in the collection of photographs published in 1968 by [[Walter Lewino]], ''L'imagination au pouvoir''.&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"&gt;''The Beginning of an Era'' ([http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm part1], [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era2.htm part 2]) Situationist International #12, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who followed the "artistic" view of the SI might view the evolution of the SI as producing a more boring or dogmatic organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Those following the political view would see the May 1968 uprisings as a logical outcome of the SI's [[dialectic]]al approach: while savaging present day society, they sought a revolutionary society which would embody the positive tendencies of capitalist development. The "realization and suppression of art" is simply the most developed of the many dialectical supersessions which the SI sought over the years. For the Situationist International of 1968, the world triumph of [[workers councils]] would bring about all these supersessions.

Though the SI were a very small group, they were expert self-propagandists, and their slogans appeared daubed on walls throughout Paris at the time of the revolt. SI member [[René Viénet]]'s 1968 book ''Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement, France, May '68'' gives an account of the involvement of the SI with the student group of [[Enragés]] and the occupation of the [[Sorbonne]].

The occupations of 1968 started at the [[University of Nanterre]] and spread to the Sorbonne. The police tried to take back the Sorbonne and a riot ensued. Following this a general strike was declared with up to 10 million workers participating. The SI originally participated in the Sorbonne occupations and defended barricades in the riots. The SI distributed calls for the [[occupation of factories]] and the formation of [[workers' councils]],&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; but, disillusioned with the students, left the university to set up [[The Council For The Maintenance Of The Occupations]] (CMDO) which distributed the SI's demands on a much wider scale. After the end of the movement, the CMDO disbanded.

===Aftermath (1968–1972)===
By 1972, [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]] and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ({{lang-en|The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=u2r2h |url=http://tangibleinfo.blogspot.com/2010/08/gianfranco-sanguinetti-full-text-of.html |title=Complete (translated) texts |publisher=Tangibleinfo.blogspot.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (inspired by [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet argued that the ruling class of Italy supported the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist influence. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalists praised its content. After reprinting the tract as a small book, Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. In the outcry that ensued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/report.html |title=Gianfranco Sanguinetti |publisher=Notbored.org |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under pressure from Italian authorities Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied entry to France.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts, and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions,&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; the SI was dissolved in 1972.&lt;ref name="Karen2001"&gt;{{cite web | title=Situationism in a nutshell | author=Karen Elliot | url=http://www.barbelith.com/cgi-bin/articles/00000011.shtml | publisher=Barbelith Webzine | date=2001-06-01 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main concepts==

===The spectacle and its society===
{{main|Spectacle (critical theory)}}

The ''Spectacle'' is a central notion in situationist theory, developed by [[Guy Debord]] in his 1967 book, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''. In its limited sense, ''spectacle'' means the [[mass media]], which are "its most glaring superficial manifestation."&lt;ref name="Debord1977t24"&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 24&lt;/ref&gt; Debord said that the society of the spectacle came to existence in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name="Brush2005p377"&gt;Brush (2005) pp. 377–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1988cII"&gt;Debord (1988) ''Comments on the Society of the Spectacle'', II&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of the ''spectacle'' is a development and application of Karl Marx's concept of [[fetishism of commodities]], [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]],&lt;ref name="Debord1967SocietyI"&gt;Guy Debord (1967) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/tsots01.html Society of the Spectacle''. (Paris, June 1967). Chapter I: Separation Perfected.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the way it was reprised by [[György Lukács]] in 1923. In the society of the spectacle, the commodities rule the workers and the [[Consumerism|consumers]] instead of being ruled by them. The consumers are passive subjects that contemplate the reified spectacle.

As early as 1958, in the [[Report on the Construction of Situations|situationist manifesto]], Debord described [[official culture]] as a "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the [[public discourse]]. Such ideas get first trivialized and sterilized, and then they are safely [[Social integration|incorporated]] back within mainstream society, where they can be exploited to add new flavors to old dominant ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1957) pp. 2, 10&lt;/ref&gt; This technique of the spectacle is sometimes called ''[[recuperation (politics)|recuperation]]'', and its counter-technique is the ''[[détournement]]''.&lt;ref name="Chasse1969Faces"&gt;Robert Chasse, Bruce Elwell, Jonathon Horelick, Tony Verlaan. (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/faces.html Faces of Recuperation]''. In the American section of the Situationist International, issue #1 (New York, June 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Détournement===
{{main|détournement}}
A ''détournement'' is a technique developed in the 1950s by the [[Letterist International]],&lt;ref name="ReportManifesto57"&gt;''[[Report on the Construction of Situations]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI58"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline///si/is1.html |title=Internationale Situationniste #1 (June 1958) |publisher=Cddc.vt.edu |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consist in "turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself,"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Holt (2010) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; like turning slogans and logos against the advertisers or the political status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaste [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=141526467 ''Exploring Occupy Wall Street's 'Adbuster' Origins''], ''NPR'', October 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Détournement'' was prominently used to set up subversive political pranks, an influential tactic called [[situationist prank]] that was reprised by the [[punk movement]] in the late 1970s&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p. 45, quote:
{{quote|[...] gioco al coplotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement''—inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk—che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, Malcom McClaren, a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scateno', con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece è stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p. 40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

===Anti-capitalism===
The Situationist International, in the 15 years from its formation in 1957 and its dissolution in 1972, is characterized by a [[Marxist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics,&lt;ref name="PoliOnArtAndPolitics"&gt;[[Francesco Poli]] (1991) p. 63. Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt; Nel 1972, quindici anni dopo la sua fondazione [[...]] l'Internazionale Situazionista si scioglie in quanto organizzazione. Durante questi anni, il movimento, caratterizzato da un'ideologia dell'estetico e del politico di matrice marxista e surrealista, produce una quantita' consistente di scritti teorici, opuscoli, libri, film e lavori artistici nel campo della pittura e della progettazione di interventi nella dimensione urbana. Di grande rilievo è il ruolo degli artisti, tra cui in particolare Asger Jorn, Constant e Pinot Gallizio;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; without separation between the two: [[art]] and politics are faced together and in [[revolutionary]] terms.&lt;ref name="BandiniArtAndPolitics"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bandini|1977}}, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Per la prima volta dopo il surrealismo, arte e politica vengono affrontate insieme in termini rivoluzionari. [[...]] L'idea chiave è quella della 'costruzione di situazioni' [[...]] L'urbanesimo unitario [[...]] Fondamentale è la 'ricerca psicogeografica': studio delle leggi esatte e degli effetti precisi che l'ambiente geografico, coscientemente disposto o no, attua direttamente sul comportamento affettivo degli individui.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The SI analyzed the modern world from the point of view of [[everyday life]].&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIEverydayLife"&gt;[[Richard Gombin]] (1971), chap. 3, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;the IS was to attempt an analysis of the modern world from the point of view of everyday life.&amp;nbsp;... The critique of everyday life is not intended to be purely an analysis; it is supposed to lead on to a revolutionary praxis.&amp;nbsp;... [[On SI analysis of consumerism:]] This process causes an accelerating degradation of everyday life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The core arguments of the Situationist International were an [[anti-capitalism|attack on the capitalist]] degradation of the life of people&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1967QualityOfLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BandiniCapitaslismDegrade"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandini|1998|Preface to second edition}}, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] reagire all'avvilita condizione dell'uomo nel sistema capitalista.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; and the fake models advertised by the [[mass media]],&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; to which the Situationist responded with alternative life experiences.&lt;ref name="Luttazzi2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Luttazzi|2008}} &lt;blockquote&gt;'''Question''': "Le profezie di Guy Debord a proposito della Società dello spettacolo si avverano sotto i nostri occhi: il governo si occupa della «percezione» delle cose da parte dei cittadini più che della sostanza materiale, dei bisogni, dei fatti. L'invenzione dell'«emergenza sicurezza» è un caso lampante. Come pensi ci si debba muovere in questo scenario?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Answer''': "Come suggeriva Debord: con pratiche di vita alternative.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; The alternative life experiences explored by the Situationists were the construction of situations, [[unitary urbanism]], [[psychogeography]], and the union of play, freedom and [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"&gt;Debord harshly denounced the degradation in the [[quality of life]] under capitalism, also in his 1957 ''Report''. {{Harvnb|Poli|1991}} said on Debord's Report: &lt;blockquote&gt;Con il suo ''Rapporto...'' del 1957, Debord definisce programmaticamente le basi teoriche del situazionismo. [[...]]
&lt;br /&gt;Nel Rapporto di Debord si legge inoltre una durissima critica allo sfruttamento capitalistico delle masse anche nel tempo libero attraverso l'industria del divertimento che abbrutisce la gente con sottoprodotti dell'ideologia mistificata della borghesia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A major stance of the SI was to count on the force of a [[revolutionary proletariat]]. This stance was reaffirmed very clearly in a discussion on "To what extent is the SI a political movement?", during the Fourth SI Conference in London.&lt;ref name="SI5Conf4"/&gt; The SI remarked that this is a core Situationist principle, and that those that don't understand it and agree with it, are not Situationist.

===Art and politics===
{{main|Art and politics}}
The SI rejected all art that separated itself from politics, the concept of [[20th-century art]] that is separated from topical political events.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"&gt;(1963) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/SIOnline/si/counter.html The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821121236/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/counter.html |date=2008-08-21 }}''. Internationale Situationniste #8 (Paris, January 1963). Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt; The SI believed that the notion of artistic expression being separated from politics and current events is one proliferated by reactionary considerations to render artwork that expresses comprehensive critiques of society impotent.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt; They recognized there was a precise mechanism followed by reactionaries to defuse the role of subversive artists and intellectuals, that is, to [[reframing|reframe]] them as separated from the most topical events, and divert from them the taste for the new that may dangerously appeal the masses; after such separation, such artworks are sterilized, banalized, degraded, and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavors to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;

According to this theory, artists and intellectuals that accept such compromises are rewarded by the [[art dealer]]s and praised by the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt; The SI received many offers to sponsor "creations" that would just have a "situationist" label but a diluted political content, that would have brought things back to order and the SI back into the old fold of artistic praxis. The majority of SI continued to refuse such offers and any involvement on the conventional avant-garde artistic plane.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt; This principle was affirmed since the founding of the SI in 1957, but the qualitative step of resolving all the contradictions of having situationists that make concessions to the cultural market, was made with the exclusion of [[Gruppe SPUR]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="1963TheCounter"/&gt;

The SI noted how reactionary forces forbid subversive ideas from artists and intellectuals to reach the [[public discourse]], and how they attack the artworks that express comprehensive critique of society, by saying that art should not involve itself into politics.&lt;ref name="Debord1957Report"/&gt;

===The construction of situations===
The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defines the constructed situation as "a moment of life concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of a unitary ambiance and a game of events."

As the SI embraced dialectical Marxism, the situation came to refer less to a specific avant-garde practice than to the dialectical unification of art and life more generally. Beyond this theoretical definition, the situation as a practical manifestation thus slipped between a series of proposals. The SI thus were first led to distinguish the situation from the mere artistic practice of the [[happening]], and later identified it in historical events such as the [[Paris Commune]] in which it exhibited itself as the revolutionary moment. The SI's interest in the Paris Commune was expressed in 1962 in their fourteen [[Situationist Theses on the Paris Commune|"Theses on the Paris Commune"]].

===Psychogeography===
{{Main|Psychogeography}}
The first edition of ''Internationale Situationniste'' defined [[psychogeography]] as "the study of the specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref name="Debord1958Definitions"/&gt; The term was first recognized in 1955 by Guy Debord while still with the Letterist International:

{{quote|The word psychogeography, suggested by an illiterate Kabyle as a general term for the phenomena a few of us were investigating around the summer of 1953, is not too inappropriate. It does not contradict the materialist perspective of the conditioning of life and thought by objective nature. Geography, for example, deals with the determinant action of general natural forces, such as soil composition or climatic conditions, on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world. Psychogeography could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, whether consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals. The charmingly vague adjective psychogeographical can be applied to the findings arrived at by this type of investigation, to their influence on human feelings, and more generally to any situation or conduct that seems to reflect the same spirit of discovery.|Guy Debord, ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography''&lt;ref name="Debord1955Introduction"/&gt;}}

====Dérive====
{{Main|Dérive}}
By definition, psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies. Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of [[dérive]] ("drift").

{{quote|In a [[dérive]] one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there... But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.|Ken Knabb&lt;ref name="Knabb, Ken 1995. pg 50"&gt;Knabb, Ken, ed. ''Situationist International Anthology'', Berkley: Bureau of Public Secrets, 1995. pg 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

SI engaged in a play-form that was also
practiced by its predecessor organization, the [[Letterist International|Lettrist International]], the art of wandering through urban space, which they termed [[dérive]], whose unique mood is conveyed in Debord's darkly romantic meaning of palindrome. Two excursions organized by Andre Breton serve as the closest cultural precedents to the [[dérive]]. The first in 1921, was an excursion to the [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre|Church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]] with the Parisian [[Dadaists]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dada in Paris|last=Sanouillet|first=Michel|last2=Ganguly|first2=Sharmila|date=2012-10-02|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262518215|edition=Revised, Expanded|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=178|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second excursion was on May 1, 1923, when a small group of [[Surrealists]] walked toward the countryside outside of [[Blois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boredom and Art: Passions of the Will To Boredom|last=Haladyn|first=Julian Jason|date=2015-10-30|publisher=Zero Books|isbn=9781782799986|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord was cautious however to differentiate between the derive and such precedents. He emphasized its active character as "a mode of experimental behavior" that reached to [[Romanticism]], the Baroque, and the age of chivalry, with its tradition of long adventures voyages. Such urban roaming was characteristic of Left Bank bohemianism in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti, Libero. "Play-Tactics of the "Internationale Situationniste""''&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.orgPlay-tactics{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the Internationale Situationniste*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(n.d.): 36-58. ''Jstor''. The MIT Press, 2000. Web. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops—the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, editor, ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel P, 1998. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, Tom, ed. ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International: Texts and Documents'', Boston: October Press, 2004. pg 259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation. The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the situationist city.

===Work, leisure, and play===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

The situationists observed that the worker of advanced capitalism still only functions with the goal of survival. In a world where technological efficiency has increased production exponentially, by tenfold, the workers of society still dedicate the whole of their lives to survival, by way of production. The purpose for which advanced capitalism is organized isn't luxury, happiness, or freedom, but production. The production of commodities is an end to itself; and production by way of survival.

The theorists of the Situationist International regarded the current paradigm of work in advanced capitalist society as increasingly absurd. As technology progresses, and work becomes exponentially efficient, the work itself becomes exponentially more trivial. The spectacle's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production. The "growth" generated by an economy developing for its own sake can be nothing other than a growth of the very alienation that was at its origin.

===Major works===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
Twelve issues of the main French edition of journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' were published, each issue edited by a different individual or group, including: [[Guy Debord]], [[Mohamed Dahoiu]], [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]], [[Maurice Wyckaert]], [[Constant Nieuwenhuys]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Helmut Sturm]], [[Attila Kotanyi]], [[Jørgen Nash]], [[Uwe Lausen]], [[Raoul Vaneigem]], [[Michèle Bernstein]], [[Jeppesen Victor Martin]], [[Jan Stijbosch]], [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Théo Frey]], [[Mustapha Khayati]], [[Donald Nicholson-Smith]], [[René Riesel]], and [[René Viénet]].

Classic Situationist texts include: ''[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]'', ''[[Society of the Spectacle]]'' by Guy Debord, and ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' by Raoul Vaneigem.

The first English-language collection of SI writings, although poorly and freely translated, was ''Leaving The 20th century'' edited by Christopher Gray. ''[[The Situationist International Anthology]]'' edited and translated by [[Ken Knabb]], collected numerous SI documents which had previously never been seen in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/index.htm|title=Situationist International Anthology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Marxism===
Rooted firmly in the [[Marxist]] tradition, the Situationist International criticized [[Trotskyism]], [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]] from a position they believed to be further left and more properly Marxist. The situationists possessed a strong anti-authoritarian current, commonly deriding the centralized bureaucracies of [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the same breath as capitalism.

Debord's work ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) established situationist analysis as [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] critical theory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} ''The Society of the Spectacle'' is widely recognized as the main and most influential Situationist essay.&lt;ref name="Agamben1990"&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]] (1990), "''Glosse in margine ai Commentari sulla societa dello spettacolo''" in {{Harvnb|Debord|1990|pp=233–250}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt; On book ''Society of Spectacle'': "l'analisi più lucida e severa delle miserie e della servitù di una società—quella dello spettacolo, in cui noi viviamo—che ha esteso oggi il suo dominio su tutto il pianeta&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was [[anti-capitalist]],&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIAntiCapitalism"&gt;[[Richard Gombin]] (1971), chap. 3, quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International is that of total contestation of modern capitalism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI6DebordTapeRecord1961"&gt;Guy Debord (1961) ''[http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/6.everyday.htm Perspectives for Conscious Changes in Everyday Life]''. This work was originally presented by tape recording 17 May 1961 at a conference of the [[Group for Research on Everyday Life]] convened in Paris by [[Henri Lefebvre]]. Its first print appearance was in Internationale Situationniste #6 (Paris, August 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SI8EditorialNotes"&gt;''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/is8.html Editorial Notes]'', Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist]], [[Young Hegelian]],&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"&gt;Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Winter 1997), quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;In particular the key issue, of how and why the situationists came to have a preponderant role in May 1968—that is, how and why their brand of politics participated in, and to an extent fueled, a crisis of the late-capitalist State—is still wide open to interpretation.&lt;/blockquote&gt; A description of the portion of the Left at clash with the situationists is found in note #4: &lt;blockquote&gt;The word "Left" [[...]] much of the time is used descriptively, and therefore pessimistically, to indicate a set of interlocking ideological directorships stretching roughly from the statist and workerist fringes of social democracy and laborism to the para-academic journals and [[think tank]]s of latter-day [[Trotskyism]], taking in the [[Stalinist]] and lightly post-Stalinist center along the way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and from the very beginning in the 50s, remarkably differently from the established Left, [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] and against all repressive regimes.&lt;ref name="BandiniAntiStalisnism"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bandini|1998|Preface to second edition}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Non a caso l'I.S. sorge ed e' coeva alla denuncia dello Stalinismo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord starts his 1967 work with a revisited version of the first sentence with which Marx began his critique of classical political economy, ''[[Das Kapital]]''.&lt;ref name="DasKapitalEntrySentence"&gt;''[[Das Kapital]]'', entry sentence, p. 125: "The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an 'immense collection of commodities'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DebordThesis1st"&gt;''"The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles."'' Debord G.E. (1967), thesis 1st.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later essay, Debord will argue that his work was the most important social critique since Marx's work. Drawing from Marx, which argued that under a capitalist society the ''[[wealth]]'' is degraded to an immense accumulation of [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodities]], Debord argues that in [[advanced capitalism]], life is reduced to an immense accumulation of spectacles, a triumph of mere appearance where "all that once was directly lived has become mere representation".&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 17, 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacle, which according to Debord is the core feature of the advanced capitalist societies,&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 34&lt;/ref&gt; has its "most glaring superficial manifestation" in the [[advertising]]-[[mass media]]-[[marketing]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on Marx's argument that under capitalism our lives and our environment are continually depleted, Debord adds that the Spectacle is the system by which capitalism tries to hide such depletion. Debord added that, further than the impoverishment in the [[quality of life]],&lt;ref name="PoliOntheReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debord1967QualityOfLife"&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 6, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 37, 60, 68, 114, 134&lt;/ref&gt; our psychic functions are altered, we get a degradation of mind and also a degradation of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 25, 192&lt;/ref&gt; In the spectacular society, knowledge is not used anymore to question, analyze, or resolve [[contradiction]]s, but to assuage reality. Such argument on the Spectacle as a mask&lt;ref name="DebordOnSpectacleRealUnity"&gt;''"The real unity the spectacle proclaims masks the class division on which the real unity of the capitalist mode of production is based."'' Debord G.E. (1967) : thesis 72.&lt;/ref&gt; of a degrading reality has been elaborated by many Situationist artists, producing [[détournement]]s of advertising where instead of a shiny life the crude reality was represented. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Situationist theorists advocated methods of operation that included [[worker's council|democratic workers' councils]] and [[workers' self-management]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-12March1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Italian section of the SI in Milan and to Mario Perniola in Rome,
12 March 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-9December1969.html Guy Debord letter] to Paolo Salvadori 9 December [19]69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-17March1970.html Guy Debord letter] To all the sections of the SI, [17 March 1970]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notbored.org/debord-30July1969.html#_edn4 Guy Debord letter] To Rene Vienet, Wednesday 30 July [19]69&lt;/ref&gt; interested in empowering the individual, in contrast to the perceived corrupt bureaucratic states of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Their anti-authoritarian interpretation of Marxist theory can be identified with the broader [[council communism|council communist]] and [[libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]] movements, themselves more broadly termed as [[left communism]].

The last issue (1972) of the ''Situationist International'' journal, featured an editorial analyzing the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]]. The editorial, written by [[Guy Debord]], was titled ''The Beginning of an Era'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Situationist International |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.era1.htm |title=''The Beginning of an Era'' |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1966-12-09 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably as a [[detournement]] reference of ''[[Nachalo]]'' (''The Beginning''), a Russian Marxist monthly magazine.

According to [[Greil Marcus]], some found similarities between the Situationists and the [[Yippies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Greil Marcus]] ''The long walk of the Situationist International'' in McDonough (2004), ''Guy Debord and the Situationist International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Former situationists Clark and Nicholson-Smith (British section), argued that the portion of the moderate Left that is the "established Left", and its "Left opinion-makers", usually addressed contemptuously the SI as "hopelessly [[young-Hegelian]]".&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt;

===Relationship with anarchism===
The Situationist International was differentiated from both [[anarchist]]s and [[Marxist]]s. In spite of this, they have frequently been associated with anarchism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Debord did a critical assessment of the anarchists in his 1967 ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) ''The Society of the Spectacle'', chap. 4 ''The Proletariat as Subject and as Representation'', theses 92-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the final, 12th issue of the journal, the situationists rejected [[spontaneism]] and the "mystics of nonorganization," labeling them as a form of "sub-anarchism":&lt;ref name="Riesel969"&gt;Riesel, René [http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/councils.html ''Preliminaries on Councils and Councilist Organization''], International Situationniste #12 (September 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The only people who will be excluded from this debate are... those who in the name of some sub-anarchist spontaneism proclaim their opposition to any form of organization, and who only reproduce the defects and confusion of the old movement—mystics of nonorganization, workers discouraged by having been mixed up with Trotskyist sects too long, students imprisoned in their impoverishment who are incapable of escaping from bolshevik organizational schemas. The situationists are obviously partisans of organization—the existence of the situationist organization testifies to that. Those who announce their agreement with our theses while crediting the SI with a vague spontaneism simply don't know how to read.}}

According to situationist [[Ken Knabb]], Debord pointed out the flaws and merits of both Marxism and anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Knabb |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/joyrev2.htm#N_3_ |title=The Joy of Revolution (chap. 2) |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |date=1980-10-28 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "the split between Marxism and anarchism crippled both sides. The anarchists rightly criticized the authoritarian and narrowly economistic tendencies in Marxism, but they generally did so in an undialectical, moralistic, ahistorical manner... and leaving Marx and a few of the more radical Marxists with a virtual monopoly on coherent dialectical analysis—until the situationists finally brought the libertarian and dialectical aspects back together again."

===Relationship with the established left===
The SI poses a challenge to the model of political action of a portion of the left,&lt;ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97"&gt;Clark and Nicholson-Smith (Spring 1997), response to [[Peter Wollen]] (March–April 1989). Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;So far as Wollen is concerned, the anger was provoked by his essay on the history of the SI, and specifically his three-sentence treatment of the organization in its last decade. We think he should look again at these sentences (which conclude some thirty pages of discussion of the SI's place in modern art), and ask himself whether they are not lofty, contemptuous, and dismissive. That's how they read to us. They seem to epitomize—and, in view of their publication history, to enshrine—a certain effort to turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties. Like Wollen, presumably, we think that those up-heavals are of much more than historical interest, and every day they are traduced and trivialized by the [[culture industry]]. Much is at stake, therefore. We wanted to denounce a loose conspirancy of silence and misrepresentation which has been the response of a portion of the Left to the challenge that the SI poses to their model of political action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the "established Left" and "Left opinion-makers".&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt; The first challenging aspect is the fueling role that the SI had in the upheavals of the political and social movements of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt; upheavals for which much is still at stake and which many foresee as recurring in the 21st century. The second challenging aspect,&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt; is the comparison between the Situationist Marxist theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle]], which is still very topical 30 years later,&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luttazzi2008"/&gt; and the current status of the theories supported by leftist establishments in the same period, like [[Althusserianism]], [[Maoism]], [[workerism]], [[Freudo-Marxism]] and others.&lt;ref name="Jappe99May68"/&gt;

The response to this challenge has been an attempt to silence and misinterpret, to "turn the SI safely into an [[art movement]], and thereby to minimize its role in the political and social movements of the sixties".&lt;ref name="BandiniImpactAndBoycott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ClarkEtAlSpring97"/&gt;

The core aspect of the revolutionary perspectives, and the political theory, of the Situationist International, has been neglected by some commentators,&lt;ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics"&gt;Ken Knabb (2006) ''SI Anthology'', Bibliography – Books about the SI – In English, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; which either limited themselves to an apolitical reading of the situationist [[avant-garde]] art works, or dismissed the Situationist political theory. Examples of this are [[Simon Sadler]]'s ''The Situationist City'',&lt;ref name="KnabbOnArtAndPolitics"/&gt; and the accounts on the SI published by the ''[[New Left Review]]''.&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt;

The concept of revolution created by the Situationist International was [[anti-capitalist]],&lt;ref name="Gombin71SIAntiCapitalism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI6DebordTapeRecord1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SI8EditorialNotes"/&gt; [[Marxist]], [[Young Hegelian]],&lt;ref name="ClarkAndNSWinter97"/&gt; and from the very beginning in the 1950s, remarkably differently from the established Left, [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] and against all repressive regimes.&lt;ref name="BandiniAntiStalisnism"/&gt; The SI called in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] for the formation of [[Workers councils]],&lt;ref name="SI12BeginningOfAnEra"/&gt; and someone has argued that they were aligned with [[council communism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There was no separation between the artistic and the political perspectives.&lt;ref name="BandiniArtAndPolitics"/&gt; For instance, [[Asger Jorn]] never believed in a conception of the Situationist ideas as exclusively artistic and separated from political involvement. He was at the root and at the core of the Situationist International project, fully sharing the revolutionary intentions with Debord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Lippolis]] (2000) ''Notizie su Asger Jorn, situazionista iperpolitico'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario Lippolis (2000) ''Un dialogo tra vandali civilizzatori nello sfacelo dell'impero della merce'' in {{Harvnb|Jorn|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Criticism===
Critics of the Situationists frequently assert that their ideas are not in fact complex and difficult to understand, but are at best simple ideas expressed in deliberately difficult language, and at worst actually nonsensical. For example, anarchist [[Chaz Bufe]] asserts in [[Listen Anarchist!]] that "obscure situationist jargon" is a major problem in the anarchist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Listen Anarchist! | author=Chaz Bufe | url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html | publisher=See Sharp Press | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Gibbons argues that the Parisian situationists failed to take on board practically or theoretically the experience of their African embers, such as is shown by [[Abdelhafid Khattib]]'s experience of police harassment while conducting psychogeographic research on [[les Halles]] in 1958. She remarks how little the suppression of Algerians in Paris had on their activity and thinking – Bernstein and Debord co-signed the ''Declaration on the Right to Insubordination in the Algerian War'' in 1961, which led to them being questioned by the police. She cites a letter written by Jacqueline de Jong, Jorgen Nash, and Ansgar Elde protesting the expulsion of the ''Spur'' group in 1962 which highlights the political repression in Paris at that time. Gibbons also criticises the lack of mention of the Algerian situationists in either Debord's or Vaneigem's memoirs.&lt;ref name="Gibbons"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbons|first1=Andrea|title=Salvaging Situationism: Race and Space {{!}} Salvage|url=http://salvage.zone/in-print/salvaging-situationism-race-and-space/|website=salvage.zone|publisher=Salvage|accessdate=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
[[File:Liberatelondon.GIF|thumb|left|evoL PsychogeogrAphix 2003]]

Debord's analysis of the spectacle has been influential among people working on television, particularly in France and Italy;&lt;ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida02Q&amp;A"&gt;Derrida (2002) Q&amp;A session at Film Forum pp. 116–7 quote: {{quote|I think you probably know that his work [Debord's] is read now more than when he was alive. At least that's the case in France. I don't know if he's read in the States, but in France he's read as presenting a precise critique and political analysis of the media, of the becoming-spectacle, the exploitation of the 'show' in politics and in the media, and television.

What's interesting is that in France people, especially the writers or the intellectuals who are often asked to appear on TV—sometimes almost every day—they [reflexively] mention Guy Debord as their master, and I hate this! So I never quote Debord when I'm on TV, and I'm almost never on TV—so I guess that's how, in my way, I'm true to Debord.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy, TV programs produced by situationist intellectuals, like Antonio Ricci's ''[[Striscia la notizia]]'', or Carlo Freccero's programming schedule for ''[[Italia 1]]'' in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="BlissettNuncEstBibendum95"&gt;[[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] (2002) [1995] ''Guy Debord Is Really Dead'', Sabotage Editions, {{ISBN|978-0-9514417-3-2}} English edition of ''[http://www.scienzepostmoderne.org/DiversiAutori/Debord/DebordMortoDavvero.html Guy Debord è morto davvero]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives. Examples of these groups include: in Amsterdam, the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]; in the UK, [[King Mob]], the producers of ''Heatwave'' magazine (including [[Charles Radcliffe]] who later briefly joined the [[Members of the Situationist International#English Section (5)|English Section of the Situationist International]]), and the [[Angry Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/The-Situationist-International-in-Britain-Modernism-Surrealism-and-the/Cooper/p/book/9781138680456|title=The Situationist International in Britain: modernism, surrealism, and the avant-gardes|last=Cooper|first=Sam|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138680456|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, groups like [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] (later [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]), [[Weatherman (organization)|The Weathermen]], and the [[Chicago Surrealist Group|Rebel Worker]] group also explicitly employed their ideas.&lt;ref name="Lang 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lang | first=Daniel | title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade | journal=Cultural Recycling | volume=3 | issue=1 |date=May 2007 | url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist theorists such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]], and [[John Zerzan]], have developed the SI's ideas in various directions away from Marxism. These theorists were predominantly associated with the magazines ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', and ''[[Green Anarchy]]''. During the early 1980s, English anarchist Larry Law produced the ''Spectacular Times'' pocket-books series, which aimed to make Situationist ideas more easily assimilated into the anarchist movement. Later anarchist theorists such as the [[CrimethInc.]] collective also claim Situationist influence.&lt;ref name="Lang 2007"/&gt;

Situationist urban theory, defined initially by the members of the [[Lettrist International]] as "Unitary Urbanism," was extensively developed through the behavioural and performance structures of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]] during the 1990s. The re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] also inspired many new psychogeographical groups including Manchester Area Psychogeographic. The LPA and the [[Neoist Alliance]] along with the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] Project came together to form a New [[Lettrist International]] with a specifically [[Communist]] perspective. Around this time, [[Unpopular Books]] and the LPA released some key texts including new translations of [[Asger Jorn]]'s work.

Around this time also, groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]] and [[Adbusters]] have, respectively, seen themselves as "creating situations" or practicing detournement on advertisements.

In cultural terms, the SI's influence has arguably been greater, if more diffuse. The list of cultural practices which claim a debt to the SI is extensive, but there are some prominent examples:
* Situationist ideas exerted a strong influence on the design language of the [[punk rock]] phenomenon of the 1970s. To a significant extent this came about due to the adoption of the style and aesthetics and sometimes slogans employed by the SI. These were often second hand, via English pro-Situ groups such as [[King Mob]] whose associates included [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[Jamie Reid]]. [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]] was influenced by Situationist [[The Haçienda|urbanism]] and Factory Records band [[The Durutti Column]] took its name from Andre Bertrand's collage ''Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Le Retour de la Colonne Durutti | author=| url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/durutti_le_retour_66.html | publisher=Cerysmatic Factory | accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bertrand, in turn, took his title from the eponymous [[Durruti Column|anarchist army]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]). U.S. punk group The [[Feederz]] have been acclaimed as exhibiting a more direct and conscious influence. Formed in the late 1970s, they became known for extensive use of detournement and their intention to provoke their audience through the exposition of Situationist themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Situationist International in American Hardcore Punk, 1982–2002 | author=Neil Nehring | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/911505403-40919005/content~content=a758328513~tab=send | publisher=Popular Music &amp; Society | date=December 2006 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other musical artists whose lyrics and artwork have referenced Situationist concepts include: [[David Bowie]], [[Seahorse Liberation Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Really Free Culture: Anarchist Communities, Radical Movements, and Public Practices | author=Lee Tusman| url=https://books.google.com/?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=seahorse+liberation+army+situationist#v=onepage&amp;q=seahorse%20liberation%20army%20situationist&amp;f=false | publisher=Pedia Press | date= 2009 | accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Love Kills Theory]], [[Chumbawamba]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Nation of Ulysses]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Joan of Arc (band)|Joan of Arc]], [[The Spectacle]], [[International Noise Conspiracy]] and [[Refused]]. Situationist theory experienced a vogue in the late '90s [[hardcore punk]] scene, being referenced by [[Orchid (screamo band)|Orchid]], [[His Hero Is Gone]], and [[CrimethInc.]]
* One can also trace situationist ideas within the development of other avant-garde threads such as [[Neoism]], as well as artists such as [[Mark Divo]].
* Some hacker related e-zines, which, like [[samizdat]], were distributed via email and [[FTP]] over early [[Internet]] links and [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] quoted and developed ideas coming from SI. A few of them were N0 Way, N0 Route, UHF, in France; and early [[Phrack]], [[Cult of the Dead Cow|cDc]] in the US. More recently, writers such as [[Thomas de Zengotita]] have echoed Situationist theories regarding the [[Mediated: How the Media Shapes your World and the Way you Live in it|spectacle]] of contemporary society.

A '''style line''' is a seam in a [[Clothing|garment]] made primarily for the purpose of its visual effect, rather than for the purpose of shaping of structuring the garment. By contrast, a [[Dart (sewing)|dart]] or [[pleat]] by itself would not be considered a style line because although each can be used to produce a pleasing visual effect, their main purpose is to shape the garment by taking in ease or adding fullness respectively. Clearly though, there can be some ambiguity as when a dart is made as part of a seam which continues beyond the dart point. If the seam beyond the dart is straight, that is, not affecting the garment's fit, it would be considered a style line.

'''The Bee and the Orange Tree''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].

==Synopsis==
After many childless years, a king and queen had a daughter, whom they named Aimée. Unfortunately, a ship she was on, wrecked. As fate would have it, she drifted ashore in her cradle.  There, an [[ogre]] couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up.  The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby.  After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne.  The brother chose his second son.

Meanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres.  A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her.  She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man.  She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language.  She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave.  After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore.  This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.

The little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince.  When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk.  The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.

Now, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed.  The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head.  The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him.  Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head.  This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.

The princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind.  With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language.  He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety.  She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape.  It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything.  Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled.  The ogre used his [[seven-league boots]] to follow.

When the ogre caught up, the princess [[Shapeshifting|turned]] herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre.  He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again.  This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar.  When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture.  Confused again, the ogre returned home.

This time the ogress came after them.  The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box.  The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand.  Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.

A princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood.  Linda tried to have the tree transplanted into her gardens, Aimee stung Linda out of jealousy.  This caused the prince and princess to quarrel, but they soon reconciled.  When Linda tried again, Aimee stung her again.  Linda tried to arm herself with a branch, but when she did, blood flowed from the tree.  Aimee went to fetch a balm for the wound.

A fairy visited the princess and when she detected the enchantment, the fairy restored the prince.  He told his story, and she restored Aimee as well, and then brought them to her parents, where they married.

'''''The Blind Leading the Blind''''', '''''Blind''''', or '''''The Parable of the Blind''''' ({{lang-nl|De parabel der blinden}}) is a painting by the [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], completed in 1568.  Executed in [[Glue-size|distemper]] on linen canvas, it measures {{convert|86|x|154|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  It depicts the Biblical parable of [[the blind leading the blind]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 15:14, and is in the collection of the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], Italy.

The painting reflects Bruegel's mastery of observation. Each figure has a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of [[globe (human eye)|globe]] and [[Enucleation of the eye|removed eyes]]. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[The Parable of the Blind (novel)|a novel]] by [[Gert Hofmann]].

Bruegel painted ''The Blind'' the year before his death.  It has a bitter, sorrowful tone, which may be related to the establishment of the [[Council of Troubles]] in 1567 by the government of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].  The council ordered mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism.  The placement of [[Sint-Anna Church (Itterbeek)|Sint-Anna Church]] of the village [[Sint-Anna-Pede]] has led to both pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations, though it is not clear that the painting was meant as a political statement.

==Description==

The painting depicts a procession of six blind, disfigured men. They pass along a path bordered by a river on one side and a village with a church on the other.{{sfn|Charcot|Richer|1889|p=74}}  The leader of the group has fallen on his back into a ditch and, because they are all linked by their staffs, seems about to drag his companions down with him.{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=124}}  A cowherd stands in the background.{{sfn|Silver|2012|p=52}}

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind (detail) - WGA3516.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting detail of a man stumbling onto his back away from the viewer.|Bruegel demonstrates mastery of [[foreshortening]] in depicting the leader of the blind men.]]

Bruegel based the work on the Biblical [[parable]] of [[the blind leading the blind]] from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 15:14,{{efn|{{bibleref2|Matthew|15:14}} }} in which Christ refers to the [[Pharisees]].{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=191}}  According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's audience was likely as familiar with [[Classics|classical literature]] as with the Bible. [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] had published his ''[[Adagia]]'' two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation ''"{{lang|la|Caecus caeco dux}}"'' ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet [[Horace]].{{sfn|Sullivan|1991|p=463}}  Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work.{{sfn|Lindsay|Huppé|1956|pp=384–385}}  The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}}

The faces and bodies of the blind men, and background detail including the church, are rendered in exceptionally fine detail.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}}  The backward-falling posture of the guide demonstrates Bruegel's mastery of [[foreshortening]].{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=124}}  Bruegel's settings tend to be fictional,{{efn|Of Bruegel's oeuvre only the ''Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples'' (1560) also has an identifiable setting.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}} }} but that of ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' has been identified{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}} as the village [[Sint-Anna-Pede]],{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=126}} and the church as [[Sint-Anna Church (Itterbeek)|Sint-Anna Church]].{{sfn|Vries|2007|p=232}}

One of four surviving Bruegel paintings in [[Glue-size|distemper]],{{efn|The others are ''[[The Adoration of the Kings (Bruegel)|The Adoration of the Kings]]'' (1564), ''[[The Misanthrope (Bruegel)|The Misanthrope]]'' (1568) and the recently-attributed [[The Wine of Saint Martin's Day|''Wine of Saint Martin's Day'']].{{sfn|Orenstein|2001|p=31}}}} the work is a [[tüchlein]], a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue. This medium was widely used in painting and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] before the advent of oil paint.  It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator [[Mayken Verhulst]]; his teacher [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]]; and painter and illuminator [[Giulio Clovio]], with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper.{{sfn|Lobkova|2010|pp=74–75}} Due to the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue, tüchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore.  ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' is in good condition and has suffered no more than some erosion,{{sfn|Edwards|2013|p=60}} such as of a herdsman and some fowl in the middle ground.{{sfn|Edwards|2013|p=71}}{{efn|The herdsman can be seen in later derivative paintings, such as the one by Pieter Brueghel the Younger.{{sfn|Edwards|2013|p=71}} }}  The grain of the linen{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}} canvas is visible beneath the delicate brushstrokes.{{sfn|Bordin|D'Ambrosio|2010|p=30}}  The work is signed and dated ''&lt;small&gt;BRVEGEL.M.D.LX.VIII&lt;/small&gt;''.{{sfn|Grossmann|1966|p=203}}  The painting measures {{convert|86|x|154|cm|in|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=191}} the largest of 1568.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}}

The austere tone is achieved through pigments in a colour scheme of mostly greys, greens, brownish-reds, and blacks.  The diagonal movement of the bodies creates a dramatic tension{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|pp=125–126}} in the foreground which is divided diagonally from the landscape background.{{sfn|Huxley|Videpoche|1938|p=52}}  The flat country features are distinctly Flemish, unlike in most of Bruegel's landscapes, in which he introduced foreign elements such as mountain ranges even into local scenery.{{sfn|Michel|Charles|2012|p=255}}

In contrast to earlier depictions of the blind as beneficiaries of divine gifts, Bruegel's men are stumbling and decrepit,{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=192}} and portrayed without sympathy.  The eyeless figure would have been interpreted as a man who had suffered punishment for wrongdoing or fighting.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=194}}

Bruegel painted with the empirical objectivity of the Renaissance.  In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts,{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=192}} though there is still some diagnostic disagreement.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|pp=61–62}}  French anatomical pathologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and anatomical artist [[Paul Richer]] published an early account, ''{{lang|fr|Les difformes et les malades dans l'art}}'' ("''The deformed and sick in art''", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}}  The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had [[Enucleation of the eye|his eyes removed]], along with the eyelids: the third suffers from [[corneal leukoma]]; the fourth atrophy of the [[globe (human eye)|globe]]; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or [[Photophobia|photophobic]]; and the sixth has [[pemphigus]]{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}} or [[bullous pemphigoid]].{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=59}}  Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as they would have had to rely on their senses of smell and hearing.{{sfnm|1a1=Delevoy|1a2=Skira|1y=1959|1p=124|2a1=Charcot|2a2=Richer|2y=1889|2p=74}}

==Background==

[[File:Brueghel - Sieben Laster - Gula.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white illustration of a chaotic scene|''Gluttony'', Bruegel, 1558. This early work follows the busy, fantastical work of [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]].]]

Sixteenth-century Europe was undergoing many societal changes: the [[Protestant Reformation]] and its [[The Reformation and art|rejection of public religious imagery]]; [[Renaissance humanism]] and its emphasis on [[empiricism]] at the expense of religious faith; and the growth of the [[middle class]] amidst the rise of [[mercantilism]].  It was a time of rapid advances in learning and knowledge, and a move towards the empirical sciences—the age of the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s printing presses.  The [[cartography]] of [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] influenced the painting of landscapes, and the advances [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] brought to the study of [[anatomy]] via the direct observation of dissected bodies, motivated artists to pay greater attention to the accuracy of the anatomy in their works.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=56}}

Art was now traded in open markets; artists sought to distinguish themselves with subjects different from traditional noble, mythological, and Biblical ones, and developed new, realistic techniques based on empirical observation.  Classical literature provided precedents for dealing with "low" subjects in art. [[Genre art]] and its depiction of ordinary people and everyday life emerged against this background.{{sfn|Sullivan|2011}}

[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] began his career illustrating landscapes and fantastic scenes in a dense style that earned him a reputation as artistic heir to [[Hieronymus Bosch]].  He soon came to follow the example of another master, [[Pieter Aertsen]], who had made a name for himself in the 1550s depicting everyday scenes in a highly realistic style, such as the detailed array of meat products that dominate his large ''Butcher's Stall'' of 1551. Bruegel's subjects became more quotidian and his style observational.{{sfn|Sullivan|2011}}  He achieved fame for detailed, accurate and realistic portrayals of [[peasant]]s, with whom his paintings were popular.  He painted on linen canvas and oak panel, and avoided scenes of magnificence and portraits of nobility or royalty.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=55}}  The peasants Bruegel at first depicted were featureless and undifferentiated; as his work matured, their physiognomy became markedly more detailed and expressive.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}}

In 1563, Bruegel married Mayken, the daughter of his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst,{{sfn|Orenstein|2001|p=7}} and moved to [[Brussels]], the seat of government in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1556–1714). In 1567 the governor of the Netherlands, the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], established the [[Council of Troubles]] (popularly called the "Blood Council") to suppress non-Catholic religions and enforce Spanish rule, leading to mass arrests and executions.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=191}}   Whether Bruegel had Calvinist sympathies or intended a political message in ''The Blind'' is not clear, but the evidence indicates he likely held views critical of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|pp=191–192, 194}}  A bitter, sorrowful tone characterizes his last works, such as ''The Blind'' and ''[[The Magpie on the Gallows]]''.{{sfn|Orenstein|2001|p=9}}

In ancient Greece the blind were depicted as having received gifts from the gods, and blind singers were held in high regard.  In mediaeval Europe, the blind were depicted as the subjects of miracles, such as Bartimaeus in the [[healing the blind near Jericho]] in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:46–52.{{efn|{{bibleref2|Mark|15:46}} }}  Following the Reformation, painted depictions of saints and miracles fell out of favour in Protestant areas.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=192}}  In Catholic thought, charitable [[works of mercy]], such as giving alms to the blind and poor, were [[good works]] which, together with faith, helped the salvation of the doer. However, the Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola fide]]'' rejected the efficacy of works in achieving salvation, prescribing that it depended on faith alone (and the complication of God's [[predestination|predestined will]] for each individual).  The status of charity for the poor and infirm diminished, and beggars saw their circumstances deteriorate.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=193}}  In popular literature of the time, the blind were depicted as rogues or targets of pranks.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=194}}  The parable of the blind leading the blind also appears as one of the illustrated proverbs in Bruegel's ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' (1559).{{efn|The proverb in Dutch is: "{{lang|nl|Als de ene blinde de andere leidt, vallen ze beiden in de gracht.}}"&lt;br /&gt;(English: "When one blind man leads another, they both fall into the ditch."){{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}} }}{{sfnm|1a1=Karcioglu|1y=2002|1p=57|2a1=Lindsay|2a2=Huppé|2y=1956|2p=384}}

==Analysis==

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Netherlandish Proverbs - detail of blind men.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Painting of a busy village scene; a detail in the background of a procession of three blind men is highlighted|Bruegel earlier depicted [[the blind leading the blind]] ''(inset)'' in ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' (1559).]]

Charles Bouleau wrote of the tension in Bruegel's compositional rhythms.  The picture is divided into nine equal parts divided by a set of parallel oblique lines.  These are divided by another network of lines at constant angles to the first.{{sfn|Bouleau|1963|p=123}}  The composition invites the reader to follow the action rather than dwell on the individual figures.  The blind men resemble each other in dress and facial features,{{sfn|Funch|1997|p=120}} and they appear as if they succeed one another in a single movement culminating in a fall,{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=126}} beginning on the left with "rambling, then hesitation, alarm, stumbling, and finally falling".{{sfn|Funch|1997|p=120}}  The succession of heads follows a curve, and the further the succession, the greater the space between heads, suggesting increasing speed.{{sfn|Funch|1997|p=120}}  The steep roofs of the background houses contribute to the composition's feeling of motion.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}}

Art historian [[Gustav Glück]] noted incongruities in that the beggars are well-dressed and carry staves and full purses.  Academics Kenneth&amp;nbsp;C. Lindsay and Bernard Huppé suggest Bruegel may have implied that the blind men represent false priests who ignored Christ's admonitions not to carry gold, purses, or staves;{{sfn|Lindsay|Huppé|1956|p=384}}{{efn|{{bibleref2|Matthew|10:10}} }} the leader carries a [[hurdy-gurdy]], a musical instrument associated with beggars in Bruegel's time;{{sfn|Minamino|2002|p=}} this perhaps implies a false minstrel, one who sings praises not for God.{{sfn|Lindsay|Huppé|1956|pp=384–385}}

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind (detail) - WGA3517.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting detail of a church. Its steeple is to the left. A withered tree stands before the church.|[[Sint-Anna Church (Itterbeek)|Sint-Anna Church]] in the village [[Sint-Anna-Pede]]. The inclusion of the church has led to conflicting interpretations of the painting.]]

The church in the background, identified as the Sint-Anna Church at [[Dilbeek]] in modern [[Belgium]],{{sfn|Vries|2007|p=232}} has sparked much commentary.  One view holds that the church is evidence of the painting's moralistic intent—that while the first two blind men stumble and are beyond redemption, the other four are behind the church and thus may be saved.  Another interpretation has it that the church, with a withered tree placed before it, is an anti-Catholic symbol, and that those who follow it will fall following a blind leader as do the men in the ditch.  Others deny any symbolism in the church, noting that churches frequently appear in Bruegel's village scenes as they were a common part of the village landscape.{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=193}}  Medical researcher [[Zeynel&amp;nbsp;A. Karcioglu]] suggests the church represents indifference to the plight of the handicapped.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=57}}

In contrast to the posed, static figures typical of paintings of the period, Bruegel suggests the trajectory of time and space through the accelerated movement of the figures.  Critics Charcot and Richer wrote that the concept of visualizing movement was not formulated until the 17th century,{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=126}} and that Bruegel prefigures motion pictures{{sfnm|1a1=Delevoy|1a2=Skira|1y=1959|1p=126|2a1=Funch|2y=1997|2p=120}} and [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]''.{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=126}}  Karcioglu sees the painting as anticipating the 19th-century [[chronophotography]] of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]].{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}}  Dutch film director [[Joris Ivens]] stated, "If Bruegel were alive today he would be a film director."{{sfn|Delevoy|Skira|1959|p=126}}

==Legacy==

''The Blind Leading the Blind'' has been considered one of the great masterpieces of painting.{{sfnm|1a1=Huxley|1a2=Videpoche|1y=1938|1p=51|2a1=Delevoy|2a2=Skira|2y=1959|2p=126}}  Bruegel's is the earliest surviving painting whose subject is the parable of the blind leading the blind, though there are earlier engravings from the [[Low Countries]] known that Bruegel was likely aware of,{{sfn|Hagen|Hagen|2003|p=193}} including [[:File:Pieter van der Heyden 001 Rijksmuseum Amsterdam 01.jpg|one]] attributed to Bosch,{{sfn|Silver|2012|p=52}} and [[:File:Cornelis Massijs - Four Blind Peasants.tiff|another]] by [[Cornelis Massijs]].{{sfn|Mieder|2008|p=263}}  Bruegel's paintings have enjoyed worldwide popularity and have been the subjects of scholarly works in disciplines even outside the arts, such as medicine.{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|pp=55–56}}

Bruegel's depictions of beggars in paintings such as ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' left a strong influence on those who followed him, such as [[David Vinckboons]]. [[Hieronymus Wierix]] incorporated a copy of ''The Blind Leading the Blind'' into the series ''Twelve Flemish Proverbs''.{{sfn|Orenstein|2001|p=77}}  A forgery attributed to [[Jacob Savery]] called ''The Blind'' appeared {{circa|1600}} bearing a false inscription dating it 1562.{{sfn|Orenstein|2001|p=78}}  Bruegel's son [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] painted a larger copy in {{circa|1616}}{{sfn|Michel|Charles|2012|p=255}} with extra details, including a flock of sheep, that hangs in the [[Louvre]];{{sfn|Karcioglu|2002|p=58}} this copy was in the collection of [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], patron of Italian [[Baroque]] painter [[Domenico Fetti]], who may have been influenced by the painting when he executed his own version of the parable around 1621–22.{{sfnm|1a1=Askew|1y=1961|1pp=23, 36|2a1=Rowlands|2y=1996|2p=254}}

--&gt;&lt;poem lang="fr"&gt;
Contemple-les, mon âme; ils sont vraiment affreux!
Pareils aux mannequins; vaguement ridicules;
Terribles, singuliers comme les somnambules;
Dardant on ne sait où leurs globes ténébreux.

Leurs yeux, d'où la divine étincelle est partie,
Comme s'ils regardaient au loin, restent levés
Au ciel; on ne les voit jamais vers les pavés
Pencher rêveusement leur tête appesantie.

Ils traversent ainsi le noir illimité,
Ce frère du silence éternel. Ô cité!
Pendant qu'autour de nous tu chantes, ris et beugles,

Eprise du plaisir jusqu'à l'atrocité,
Vois! je me traîne aussi! mais, plus qu'eux hébété,
Je dis: Que cherchent-ils au Ciel, tous ces aveugles?

French comics artist [[F'murr]]'s comic strip ''Les Aveugles'' (1991) was directly inspired by Bruegel's painting ''The Blind Leading the Blind''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fmurr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bruegel_the_elder_pieter.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==

''The Blind Leading the Blind'' and ''The Misanthrope'' were discovered in the collection of the Count Giovanni Battista Masi of [[Parma]] in 1612, when [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]] confiscated Masi's property for his part in a conspiracy against the [[House of Farnese]].  How the painting arrived in Italy is uncertain, though it is known that Masi's father Cosimo returned from the Netherlands in 1595 with a number of Netherlandish paintings.{{sfn|Edwards|2013|p=60}}  The Farnese art collection came to be one of the largest of the Renaissance era, divided amongst the Farnese residences in Parma and Rome.{{sfn|Risser|Saunders|2013|pp=14–15}}

In the 18th century, [[Charles III of Spain]] inherited the collection from his mother, [[Elisabeth Farnese]], heiress of the [[Duchy of Parma]] in north Italy, who became Queen consort of Spain.  As a younger son, Charles had been made [[Duke of Parma]], then boldly seized the [[Kingdom of Naples]], becoming [[Charles III of Spain|Charles VII of Naples]], before inheriting the Spanish throne.  Charles housed the collection in what is now the [[Museo di Capodimonte|National Museum of Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Risser|Saunders|2013|pp=14–15}}  The painting hangs in the Capodimonte{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=10}} with ''The Misanthrope'', as part of the [[Farnese collection]].{{sfn|Bonn|2006|pp=84, 86}}

'''Tom De Haven''' (born 1949) is an American [[author]], [[editing|editor]], [[journalist]], and writing teacher. His recurring subjects include literary and [[film noir]], the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio system]] and the American comics industry. De Haven is noted for his comics-themed novels, including the ''Derby Dugan'' trilogy and ''[[It's Superman]]''.

==Life and career==
De Haven was born in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt; He attended [[Catholic School]], where he was a classmate of fellow author [[George R. R. Martin]], though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a [[cartoonist]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven2.html |title=Tom DeHaven's Biography |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work= |publisher=ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college,&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t_text.htm |title=An Interview with Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=Fall 2005 |work=Vol 4, No. 2 |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization "the First Great Disappointment Of My Life".&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; He received a [[Sociology]] degree from [[Rutgers University]] in 1971 and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1973.

An avid reader of [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, De Haven considers himself a [[Narrative#Literary theory|narrative writer]], and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

He began teaching creative writing [[part-time]] at [[Hofstra University]] in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach [[American Studies]] (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a [[full-time]] teacher.

De Haven is currently{{When|date=December 2009}} a full professor of Creative Writing at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including "The Graphic Novel",&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the [[First Novelist|VCU's First Novelist Award]], honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He considers himself a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and has been criticized for anti-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] statements he has made over the years.&lt;ref name="thunderchild"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven.html |title=The Thunder Child Interview |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work=interview |publisher=The ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author noted in an interview that he agreed with [[Robert Crumb]]'s observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to [[Art Spiegelman]]'s statement "that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in", as he was born in the Forties.&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt;

As a freelance journalist, he has written [[Literary criticism|criticism]] for publications such as the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. De Haven’s novels include the ''Funny Paper'' trilogy (consisting of ''Funny Papers'' (1985), ''Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies'' (1996) and ''Dugan Under Ground'' (2001)). The trilogy's [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] stretches from  the beginnings of the newspaper [[comic strip]]s in the 1890s to the 1970s.

The ''New York Times Book Review'' called the ''Derby'' books "a mighty accomplishment: [[John Dos Passos]]’s [[U.S.A. trilogy]] for comic [[geeks]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/07/13/nnp/19817.html |title=Mighty Accomplishment |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |year=2001 |work=New York Times Book Review |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Globe]] hails the trilogy as a "wild ride" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |title=It's Superman! |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |work=Pressroom |publisher=Chronicle Books |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313233804/http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, his novel ''It’s Superman'' reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the [[Great Depression]]. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by [[DC Comics]] in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about [[Superman]]: "[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me [[blank cheque|carte blanche]]."&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the [[period piece]]. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the [[New Deal]] era and expose corrupt politicians.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real "[[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]" of New York.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
De Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t.htm |title=Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=November 2005 |work=Interview |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel, ''Depression Funnies'', received an [[American Book Award]] in 1997. ''Dugan Under Ground'' received the [[Library of Virginia]] Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">'''Upuh Ulen-Ulen,''' also known as '''kerawang gayo,''' is a traditional cloth of the [[Gayonese]] people in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]].
[[File:Upuh Ulen-Ulen.jpg|thumb|300 px| Upuh Ulen-Ulen from the collection of the Indonesian poet [[Deknong Kemalawati]]]]

The cloth is traditionally placed on a young couple during a wedding ceremony, as well as on the shoulders of guests of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kodamim-tniad.mil.id/2016/11/21/kenakan-upuh-ulen-ulen-pangdam-im-dan-ibu-jadi-warga-kehormatan-gayo/ Kenakan Upuh Ulen-Ulen, Pangdam IM dan Ibu Jadi Warga Kehormatan Gayo]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2018, the Acheh poet [[Lesik Kati Ara]] presented [[Joko Widodo]], the president of Indonesia, with a cloth in the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|State Palace]] in [[Jakarta]]. &lt;ref&gt; Fikar W Eda. [http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2018/04/07/penyair-lk-ara-baca-puisi-bandara-rembela-lalu-serahkan-upuh-ulen-ulen-kepada-presiden-jokowi Penyair LK Ara Baca Puisi «Bandara Rembela» Lalu Serahkan Upuh Ulen-Ulen kepada Presiden Jokowi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth has many components. Traditionally, the background is meant to be the same as 'the contrast and color of the Earth'. According to a Gayonese proverb, God created man from the earth, who then lives on the earth and ultimately returns to the earth after death. The white circle in the center symbolizes a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrian Kausyar. [http://www.lintasgayo.com/7936/upuh-ulen-ulen.html Upuh Ulen-Ulen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other motifs found in Upuh Ulen-Ulen are: 

# A fence (''jang''), since everything in the world has a certain limit, beyond which one should not go.
# Sprouts of bamboo (''tuwis''), which are symbols of persistence, longevity, and happiness.
# A string of clouds (''enum beriring''), which is an allegory of our path through life.&lt;ref&gt; Rosmala Dewi, Irsanti.
