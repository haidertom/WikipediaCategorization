'''''A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits''''' is the title of a [[master's thesis]] written by [[computer science]] pioneer [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Claude E. Shannon]] while attending the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1937.  In his thesis, Shannon, a dual degree graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], proved that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The utilization of the [[wikt:binary|binary]] properties of electrical switches to perform logic functions is the basic concept that underlies all [[digital computer|electronic digital computer]] designs.  Shannon's thesis became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design when it became widely known among the [[electrical engineering]] community during and after [[World War II]].  At the time, the methods employed to design logic circuits were ''[[ad hoc]]'' in nature and lacked the theoretical discipline that Shannon's paper supplied to later projects.

'''Addressing modes''' are an aspect of the [[instruction set architecture]] in most [[central processing unit]] (CPU) designs. The various addressing modes that are defined in a given instruction set architecture define how [[machine code|machine language]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] in that architecture identify the [[operand]](s) of each instruction. An addressing mode specifies how to calculate the effective [[memory address]] of an operand by using information held in [[processor register|register]]s and/or constants contained within a machine instruction or elsewhere.

In [[computer programming]], addressing modes are primarily of interest to [[compiler]] writers and to those who write in [[assembly language]]s.

==Caveats==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Note that there is no generally accepted way of naming the various addressing modes. In particular, different authors and computer manufacturers may give different names to the same addressing mode, or the same names to different addressing modes. Furthermore, an addressing mode which, in one given architecture, is treated as a single addressing mode may represent functionality that, in another architecture, is covered by two or more addressing modes. For example, some [[complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) architectures, such as the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] [[VAX]], treat registers and [[value (computer science)|literal or immediate constants]] as just another addressing mode. Others, such as the [[IBM System/360]] and its successors, and most [[reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) designs, encode this information within the instruction. Thus, the latter machines have three distinct instruction codes for copying one register to another, copying a literal constant into a register, and copying the contents of a memory location into a register, while the VAX has only a single "MOV" instruction.

The term "addressing mode" is itself subject to different interpretations: either "memory address calculation mode" or "operand accessing mode". Under the first interpretation, instructions that do not read from memory or write to memory (such as "add literal to register") are considered not to have an "addressing mode". The second interpretation allows for machines such as VAX which use operand mode bits to allow for a register or for a literal operand. Only the first interpretation applies to instructions such as "load effective address".

The addressing modes listed below are divided into code addressing and data addressing. Most computer architectures maintain this distinction, but there are, or have been, some architectures which allow (almost) all addressing modes to be used in any context.

The instructions shown below are purely representative in order to illustrate the addressing modes, and do not necessarily reflect the mnemonics used by any particular computer.

==Number of addressing modes==
Different computer architectures vary greatly as to the number of addressing modes they provide in hardware. There are some benefits to eliminating complex addressing modes and using only one or a few simpler addressing modes, even though it requires a few extra instructions, and perhaps an extra register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=36204.36193|title=How many addressing modes are enough?|author1=F.

Lipasti |year=2004 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; much easier to design [[instruction pipeline|pipelined]] CPUs if the only addressing modes available are simple ones.

Most RISC architectures have only about five simple addressing modes, while CISC architectures such as the DEC VAX have over a dozen addressing modes, some of which are quite complicated. The IBM [[System/360]] architecture had only three addressing modes; a few more have been added for the [[System/390]].

When there are only a few addressing modes, the particular addressing mode required is usually encoded within the instruction code
(e.g. IBM System/360 and successors, most RISC). But when there are lots of addressing modes, a specific field is often set aside in the instruction to specify the addressing mode. The DEC VAX allowed multiple memory operands for almost all instructions, and so reserved the first few [[bit]]s of each operand specifier to indicate the addressing mode for that particular operand.
Keeping the addressing mode specifier bits separate from the opcode operation bits produces an [[orthogonal instruction set]].

Even on a computer with many addressing modes, measurements of actual programs&lt;ref name="hennessy-patterson-c54x"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX69oNsazH4C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|author1=John L.

Since most such measurements are based on code generated from high-level languages by compilers, this reflects to some extent the limitations of the compilers being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tahar/coen6741/notes/Chapter2-4p.pdf|title=Instruction Set Principles: Addressing Mode Usage (Summary)|author=Dr. Sofiène Tahar|quote=3 programs measured on machine with all address modes (VAX) ... 75% displacement and immediate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930125040/http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tahar/coen6741/notes/Chapter2-4p.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hennessy-patterson-c54x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficient and Language-Independent Mobile Programs|author1=Ali-Reza Adl-Tabatabai|author2=Geoff Langdale|author3=Steven Lucco|author4=Robert Wahbe|year=1995|quote=79% of all instructions executed could be replaced by RISC instructions or synthesized into RISC instructions using only basic block instruction combination.|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=231402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Useful side effect==
Some instruction set architectures, such as [[Intel x86]] and IBM/360 and its successors, have a '''load effective address''' instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performs a calculation of the effective operand address, but instead of acting on that memory location, it loads the address that would have been accessed into a register. This can be useful when passing the address of an array element to a subroutine. It may also be a slightly sneaky way of doing more calculations than normal in one instruction; for example, using such an instruction with the addressing mode "base+index+offset" (detailed below) allows one to add two registers and a constant together in one instruction.

==Simple addressing modes for code==

===Absolute or direct===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           address            |
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = address)

The effective address for an absolute instruction address is the address parameter itself with no modifications.

===PC-relative===
    +----+------------------------------+
    |jump|           offset             |    jump relative
    +----+------------------------------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + offset, offset may be negative)

The effective address for a [[program counter|PC]]-relative instruction address is the offset parameter added to the address of the next instruction. This offset is usually signed to allow reference to code both before and after the instruction.

This is particularly useful in connection with jumps, because typical jumps are to nearby instructions (in a high-level language most '''if''' or '''while''' statements are reasonably short). Measurements of actual programs suggest that an 8 or 10 bit offset is large enough for some 90% of conditional jumps (roughly &amp;plusmn;128 or &amp;plusmn;512 bytes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Kong and Patterson|title=Instruction set design|year=1995|at=Slide 27|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/152/lec3.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of PC-relative addressing is that the code may be [[position independent code|position-independent]], i.e. it can be loaded anywhere in memory without the need to adjust any addresses.

Some versions of this addressing mode may be conditional referring to two registers ("jump if reg1=reg2"),
one register ("jump unless reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. See also [[#conditional execution|conditional execution]] below.

===Register indirect===
    +-------+-----+
    |jumpVia| reg |
    +-------+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = contents of register 'reg')

The effective address for a Register indirect instruction is the address in the specified register. For example, (A7) to access the content of address register A7.

The effect is to transfer control to the instruction whose address is in the specified register.

Many RISC machines, as well as the CISC [[IBM System/360]] and successors, have subroutine call instructions that place the [[return statement|return address]] in an address register—the register-indirect addressing mode is used to return from that subroutine call.

==Sequential addressing modes==

===Sequential execution===
    +------+
    | nop  |              execute the following instruction
    +------+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address)

The CPU, after executing a sequential instruction, immediately executes the following instruction.

Sequential execution is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

Most instructions on most CPU architectures are sequential instructions.
Because most instructions are sequential instructions, CPU designers often add features that deliberately sacrifice performance on the other instructions—branch instructions—in order to make these sequential instructions run faster.

Conditional branches load the PC with one of 2 possible results, depending on the condition—most CPU architectures use some other addressing mode for the "taken" branch, and sequential execution for the "not taken" branch.

Many features in modern CPUs -- [[instruction prefetch]] and more complex [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]ing, [[out-of-order execution]], etc. -- maintain the illusion that each instruction finishes before the next one begins, giving the same final results, even though that's not exactly what happens internally.

Each "[[basic block]]" of such sequential instructions exhibits both temporal and spatial [[locality of reference]].

====CPUs that do not use sequential execution====
CPUs that do not use sequential execution with a program counter are extremely rare. In some CPUs, each instruction always specifies the address of next instruction. Such CPUs have an instruction pointer that holds that specified address; it is not a program counter because there is no provision for incrementing it. Such CPUs include some [[drum memory]] computers such as the [[IBM 650]], the [[SECD machine]], and the RTX 32P.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec5_3.html "Architecture of the RTX 32P"]
by Philip Koopman 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Other computing architectures go much further, attempting to bypass the [[von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] using a variety of [[program counter#Consequences in machine architecture|alternatives to the program counter]].

===Conditional execution===
Some computer architectures have conditional instructions (such as [[ARM architecture|ARM]], but no longer for all instructions in 64-bit mode) or conditional load instructions (such as x86) which can in some cases make conditional branches unnecessary and avoid flushing the [[instruction pipeline]].  An instruction such as a 'compare' is used to set a [[status register|condition code]], and subsequent instructions include a test on that condition code to see whether they are obeyed or ignored.

===Skip===
    +------+-----+-----+
    |skipEQ| reg1| reg2|      skip the next instruction if reg1=reg2
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective PC address = next instruction address + 1)

Skip addressing may be considered a special kind of PC-relative addressing mode with a fixed "+1" offset. Like PC-relative addressing, some CPUs have versions of this addressing mode that only refer to one register ("skip if reg1=0") or no registers, implicitly referring to some previously-set bit in the [[status register]]. Other CPUs have a version that selects a specific bit in a specific byte to test ("skip if bit 7 of reg12 is 0").

Unlike all other conditional branches, a "skip" instruction never needs to flush the [[instruction pipeline]], though it may need to cause the next instruction to be ignored.

==Simple addressing modes for data==

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS REGISTER}}Register (or Register Direct)===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | mul  | reg1| reg2| reg3|      reg1 := reg2 * reg3;
    +------+-----+-----+-----+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

In this example, all the operands are in registers, and the result is placed in a register.

==={{anchor|REGISTER PLUS IMMIEDIATE CONSTANT}}Base plus offset, and variations===
This is sometimes referred to as 'base plus displacement'
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|     offset     |  reg := RAM[base + offset]
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register)

The [[offset (computer science)|offset]] is usually a signed 16-bit value (though the [[80386]] expanded it to 32 bits).

If the offset is zero, this becomes an example of ''register indirect'' addressing; the effective address is just the value in the base register.

On many RISC machines, register&amp;nbsp;0 is fixed at the value zero. If register&amp;nbsp;0 is used as the base register, this becomes an example of ''absolute addressing''. However, only a small portion of memory can be accessed (64 [[kilobyte]]s, if the offset is 16 bits).

The 16-bit offset may seem very small in relation to the size of current computer memories (which is why the [[80386]] expanded it to 32-bit). It could be worse: IBM System/360 mainframes only have an unsigned 12-bit offset. However, the principle of [[locality of reference]] applies: over a short time span, most of the data items a program wants to access are fairly close to each other.

This addressing mode is closely related to the indexed absolute addressing mode.

Within a subroutine a programmer will mainly be interested in the parameters and the local variables, which will rarely exceed 64 [[kilobyte|KB]], for which one base register (the [[frame pointer]]) suffices. If this routine is a class method in an object-oriented language, then a second base register is needed which points at the attributes for the current object ('''this''' or '''self''' in some high level languages).

''Example 2'':
If the base register contains the address of a [[composite type]] (a record or structure), the offset can be used to select a field from that record (most records/structures are less than 32 kB in size).

===Immediate/literal===
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+
    | add  | reg1| reg2|    constant    |    reg1 := reg2 + constant;
    +------+-----+-----+----------------+

This "addressing mode" does not have an effective address, and is not considered to be an addressing mode on some computers.

The constant might be signed or unsigned. For example, &lt;code&gt;move.l #$FEEDABBA, D0&lt;/code&gt; to move the immediate hex value of "FEEDABBA" into register D0.

Instead of using an operand from memory, the value of the operand is held within the instruction itself. On the DEC VAX machine, the literal operand sizes could be 6, 8, 16, or 32 bits long.

[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andrew Tanenbaum]] showed that 98% of all the constants in a program would fit in 13 bits (see [[Reduced instruction set computer#RISC design philosophy|RISC design philosophy]]).

===Implicit===
    +-----------------+
    | clear carry bit |
    +-----------------+
 
    +-------------------+
    | clear Accumulator |
    +-------------------+
The implied addressing mode, also called the implicit addressing mode ([[X86 assembly language]]), does not explicitly specify an effective address for either the source or the destination (or sometimes both).

Either the source (if any) or destination effective address (or sometimes both) is implied by the opcode.

Implied addressing was quite common on older computers (up to mid-1970s). Such computers typically had only a single register in which arithmetic could be performed—the accumulator. Such [[accumulator machine]]s implicitly reference that accumulator in almost every instruction. For example, the operation &lt; a := b + c; &gt; can be done using the sequence &lt; load b; add c; store a; &gt; -- the destination (the accumulator) is implied in every "load" and "add" instruction; the source (the accumulator) is implied in every "store" instruction.

Later computers generally had more than one [[general purpose register]] or RAM location which could be the source or destination or both for arithmetic—and so later computers need some other addressing mode to specify the source and destination of arithmetic.

Among the x86 instructions, some use implicit registers for one of the operands or results (multiplication, division, counting conditional jump).

Many computers (such as x86 and AVR) have one special-purpose register called the [[stack pointer]] which is implicitly incremented or decremented when pushing or popping data from the stack, and the source or destination effective address is (implicitly) the address stored in that stack pointer.

Many 32-bit computers (such as 68000, ARM, or PowerPC) have more than one register which could be used as a stack pointer—and so use the "register autoincrement indirect" addressing mode to specify which of those registers should be used when pushing or popping data from a stack.

Some current computer architectures (e.g. IBM/390 and Intel Pentium) contain some instructions with implicit operands in order to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier designs.

On many computers, instructions that flip the user/system mode bit, the interrupt-enable bit, etc. implicitly specify the special register that holds those bits. This simplifies the hardware necessary to trap those instructions in order to meet the [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements]]—on such a system, the trap logic does not need to look at any operand (or at the final effective address), but only at the opcode.

A few CPUs have been designed where every operand is always implicitly specified in every instruction -- [[Instruction set#Number of operands|zero-operand]] CPUs.

==Other addressing modes for code or data==

===Absolute/direct===
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
    | load | reg |         address                      |
    +------+-----+--------------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address as given in instruction)

This requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. It is often available on CISC machines which have variable-length instructions, such as [[x86]].

Some RISC machines have a special ''Load Upper Literal'' instruction which places a 16- or 20-bit constant in the top half of a register.  That can then be used as the base register in a base-plus-offset addressing mode which supplies the low-order 16 or 12 bits.  The combination allows a full 32-bit address.

===Indexed absolute===
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
    | load | reg |index|         address                |
    +------+-----+-----+--------------------------------+
 
    (Effective address = address + contents of specified index register)

This also requires space in an instruction for quite a large address. The address could be the start of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

Note that this is more or less the same as base-plus-offset addressing mode, except that the offset in this case is large enough to address any memory location.

''Example 1'':
Within a subroutine, a programmer may define a string as a local constant or a [[static variable]].
The address of the string is stored in the literal address in the instruction.
The offset—which character of the string to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.

''Example 2'':
A programmer may define several large arrays as globals or as [[field (computer science)|class variables]].
The start of the array is stored in the literal address (perhaps modified at program-load time by a [[relocating loader]]) of the instruction that references it.
The offset—which item from the array to use on this iteration of a loop—is stored in the index register.
Often the instructions in a loop re-use the same register for the loop counter and the offsets of several arrays.

===Base plus index===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector, and the index could select the particular array element required. The processor may scale the [[index register]] to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]]. This could be used for accessing elements of an array passed as a parameter.

===Base plus index plus offset===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
    | load | reg | base|index|         offset |
    +------+-----+-----+-----+----------------+
 
    (Effective address = offset + contents of specified base register + contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or vector of records, the index could select the particular record required, and the offset could select a field within that record. The processor may scale the index register to allow for the [[stride of an array|size of each array element]].

===Scaled===
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|index|
    +------+-----+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = contents of specified base register + scaled contents of specified index register)

The base register could contain the start address of an array or [[vector data structure]], and the index could contain the offset of the one particular array element required.

This addressing mode dynamically scales the value in the index register to allow for the size of each array element, e.g. if the array elements are double precision floating-point numbers occupying 8 bytes each then the value in the index register is multiplied by 8 before being used in the effective address calculation. The scale factor is normally restricted to being a [[power of two]], so that [[bit shift|shifting]] rather than multiplication can be used.

===Register indirect===
    +------+------+-----+
    | load | reg1 | base|
    +------+------+-----+
  
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

A few computers have this as a distinct addressing mode. Many computers just use ''base plus offset'' with an offset value of 0. For example, (A7)

===Register autoincrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-------+
    | load | reg | base  |
    +------+-----+-------+
 
    (Effective address = contents of base register)

After determining the effective address, the value in the base register is incremented by the size of the data item that is to be accessed. For example, (A7)+ would access the content of the address register A7, then increase the address pointer of A7 by 1 (usually 1 word). Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step through all the elements of an array or vector.

In high-level languages it is often thought to be a good idea that functions which return a result should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] (lack of side effects makes program understanding and validation much easier). This addressing mode has a side effect in that the base register is altered. If the subsequent memory access causes an error (e.g. page fault, bus error, address error) leading to an interrupt, then restarting the instruction becomes much more problematic since one or more registers may need to be set back to the state they were in before the instruction originally started.

There have been at least two computer architectures which have had implementation problems with regard to recovery from interrupts when this addressing mode is used:
*Motorola 68000 (address is represented in 24 bits). Could have one or two autoincrement register operands. The [[68010]]+ resolved the problem by saving the processor's internal state on [[bus error|bus]] or address errors.
*DEC VAX. Could have up to 6 autoincrement register operands. Each operand access could cause two [[page fault]]s (if operands happened to straddle a page boundary). Of course the instruction itself could be over 50 bytes long and might straddle a page boundary as well!

===Register autodecrement indirect===
    +------+-----+-----+
    | load | reg | base|
    +------+-----+-----+
 
    (Effective address = new contents of base register)

Before determining the effective address, the value in the base register is decremented by the size of the data item which is to be accessed.

Within a loop, this addressing mode can be used to step backwards through all the elements of an array or vector. A stack can be implemented by using this mode in conjunction with the previous addressing mode (autoincrement).

See the discussion of side-effects under the [[#Register autoincrement indirect|autoincrement addressing mode]].

===Memory indirect===
Any of the addressing modes mentioned in this article could have an extra bit to indicate indirect addressing, i.e. the address calculated using some mode is in fact the address of a location (typically a complete [[word (data type)|word]]) which contains the actual effective address.

Indirect addressing may be used for code or data. It can make implementation of ''pointers'', ''references'', or ''[[handle (computing)|handle]]s'' much easier, and can also make it easier to call subroutines which are not otherwise addressable. Indirect addressing does carry a performance penalty due to the extra memory access involved.

Some early minicomputers (e.g. DEC [[PDP-8]], [[Data General Nova]]) had only a few registers and only a limited addressing range (8 bits). Hence the use of memory indirect addressing was almost the only way of referring to any significant amount of memory.

===PC-relative===
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
    | load | reg1 | base=PC |     offset     |
    +------+------+---------+----------------+
 
    reg1 := RAM[PC + offset]
    (Effective address = PC + offset)

The PC-relative addressing mode can be used to load a register with a value stored in program memory a short distance away from the current instruction. It can be seen as a special case of the "base plus offset" addressing mode, one that selects the program counter (PC) as the "base register".

There are a few CPUs that support PC-relative data references. Such CPUs include:

The [[x86-64]] architecture and the 64-bit [[ARMv8-A]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quequero.org/2014/04/introduction-to-arm-architecture/|title=Introduction to ARMv8 64-bit Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; have PC-relative addressing modes, called "RIP-relative" in x86-64 and "literal" in ARMv8-A.  The [[Motorola 6809]] also supports a PC-relative addressing mode.

The [[PDP-11]] architecture, the [[VAX]] architecture, and the 32-bit [[ARM architecture]]s support PC-relative addressing by having the PC in the register file.

When this addressing mode is used, the compiler typically places the constants in a [[literal pool]] immediately before or immediately after the subroutine that uses them, to prevent accidentally executing those constants as instructions.

This addressing mode, which always fetches data from memory or stores data to memory and then sequentially falls through to execute the next instruction (the effective address points to data), should not be confused with "PC-relative branch" which does not fetch data from or store data to memory, but instead branches to some other instruction at the given offset (the effective address points to an executable instruction).

==Obsolete addressing modes==
The addressing modes listed here were used in the 1950–1980 period, but are no longer available on most current computers.
This list is by no means complete; there have been many other interesting and peculiar addressing modes used from time to time, e.g.  absolute-minus-logical-OR of two or three index registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/704/24-6661-2_704_Manual_1955.pdf|title=704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine Manual of Operation|pages=10–11|publisher=[[IBM]]|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/7090/22-6528-4_7090Manual.pdf|title=Reference Manual IBM 7090 Data Processing System|pages=9–10|publisher=IBM|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-level memory indirect===
If the word size is larger than the address, then the word referenced for memory-indirect addressing could itself have an indirect flag set to indicate another memory indirect cycle. This flag is referred to as an '''indirection bit''', and the resulting pointer is a [[tagged pointer]], the indirection bit tagging whether it is a direct pointer or an indirect pointer. Care is needed to ensure that a chain of indirect addresses does not refer to itself; if it does, one can get an [[infinite loop]] while trying to resolve an address.

The [[IBM 1620]], the [[Data General Nova]], the [[HP 2100]] series, and the [[NAR 2]] each have such a multi-level memory indirect, and could enter such an infinite address calculation loop.
The memory indirect addressing mode on the Nova influenced the invention of [[threaded code#Development of Threaded Code|indirect threaded code]].

The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer with [[18-bit]] addresses and 36-bit words allowed multi-level indirect addressing with the possibility of using an index register at each stage as well.

===Memory-mapped registers===
On some computers, the registers were regarded as occupying the first 8 or 16 words of memory (e.g. [[ICT 1900 series|ICL 1900]], DEC PDP-10). This meant that there was no need for a separate "add register to register" instruction – one could just use the "add memory to register" instruction.

In the case of early models of the PDP-10, which did not have any cache memory, a tight inner loop loaded into the first few words of memory (where the fast registers were addressable if installed) ran much faster than it would have in magnetic core memory.

Later models of the DEC [[PDP-11]] series mapped the registers onto addresses in the input/output area, but this was primarily intended to allow remote diagnostics. Confusingly, the 16-bit registers were mapped onto consecutive 8-bit byte addresses.

===Memory indirect and autoincrement===
The DEC [[PDP-8]] minicomputer had eight special locations (at addresses 8 through 15). When accessed via memory indirect addressing, these locations would automatically increment after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it easy to step through memory in a loop without needing to use any registers to handle the steps.

The [[Data General Nova]] minicomputer had 16 special memory locations at addresses 16 through 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When accessed via memory indirect addressing, 16 through 23 would automatically increment before use, and 24 through 31 would automatically decrement before use.

===Zero page===
The [[Data General Nova]], [[Motorola 6800]] family, and [[MOS Technology 6502]] family of processors had very few internal registers. Arithmetic and logical instructions were mostly performed against values in memory as opposed to internal registers. As a result, many instructions required a two-byte (16-bit) location to memory. Given that opcodes on these processors were only one byte (8 bits) in length, memory addresses could make up a significant part of code size.

Designers of these processors included a partial remedy known as "zero page" addressing. The initial 256 bytes of memory ($0000 – $00FF; a.k.a., page "0") could be accessed using a one-byte absolute or indexed memory address. This reduced instruction execution time by one clock cycle and instruction length by one byte. By storing often-used data in this region, programs could be made smaller and faster.

As a result, the zero page was used similarly to a register file. On many systems, however, this resulted in high utilization of the zero page memory area by the operating system and user programs, which limited its use since free space was limited.

===Direct page===
The zero page address mode was enhanced in several late model 8-bit processors, including the [[WDC 65816]], the [[CSG 65CE02]], and the [[Motorola 6809]]. The new mode, known as "direct page" addressing, added the ability to move the 256-byte zero page memory window from the start of memory (offset address $0000) to a new location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory.

The CSG 65CE02 allowed the direct page to be moved to any 256-byte boundary within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing an 8-bit offset value in the new base page (B) register. The Motorola 6809 could do the same with its direct page (DP) register. The WDC 65816 went a step further and allowed the direct page to be moved to any location within the first 64&amp;nbsp;KB of memory by storing a 16-bit offset value in the new direct (D) register.

As a result, a greater number of programs were able to utilize the enhanced direct page addressing mode versus legacy processors that only included the zero page addressing mode.

===Scaled index with bounds checking===
This is similar to scaled index addressing, except that the instruction has two extra operands (typically constants), and the hardware checks that the index value is between these bounds.

Another variation uses vector descriptors to hold the bounds; this makes it easy to implement dynamically allocated arrays and still have full bounds checking.

===Register indirect to byte within word===
The DEC [[PDP-10]] computer used [[36-bit]] words. It had special instructions which allowed memory to be treated as a sequence of bytes (bytes could be any size from 1 bit to 36 bits). A one-word sequence descriptor in memory, called a "byte pointer", held the current word address within the sequence, a bit position within a word, and the size of each byte.

Instructions existed to load and store bytes via this descriptor, and to increment the descriptor to point at the next byte (bytes were not split across word boundaries). Much DEC software used five 7-bit bytes per word (plain ASCII characters), with one bit per word unused. Implementations of [[C (programming language)|C]] had to use four 9-bit bytes per word, since the 'malloc' function in C assumes that the size of an ''int'' is some multiple of the size of a ''char'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codingunit.com/c-reference-stdlib-h-function-malloc "C Reference: function malloc()"]&lt;/ref&gt; the actual multiple is determined by the system-dependent compile-time operator [[sizeof]].

===Index next instruction===
The [[Elliott 503]],&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;Dave Brooks. [https://web.archive.org/web/20141101211113/http://members.iinet.com.au/~daveb/history.html#puzzle "Some Old Computers"].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Elliott 803]],&lt;ref name="brooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Purvis. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173228/http://bil.members.beeb.net/inst803.html "Some details of the Elliott 803B hardware"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] only used absolute addressing, and did not have any index registers.
Thus, indirect jumps, or jumps through registers, were not supported in the instruction set. Instead, it could be instructed to ''add the contents of the current memory word to the next instruction''. Adding a small value to the next instruction to be executed could, for example, change a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 0&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;JUMP 20&lt;/code&gt;, thus creating the effect of an indexed jump. Note that the instruction is modified on-the-fly and remains unchanged in memory, i.e. it is not [[self-modifying code]]. If the value being added to the next instruction was large enough, it could modify the opcode of that instruction as well as or instead of the address.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
'''Analytical jurisprudence''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] that draws on the resources of modern [[analytical philosophy]] to try to understand the nature of law. Since the boundaries of analytical philosophy are somewhat vague, it is difficult to say how far it extends.  [[H. L. A. Hart]] was probably the most influential writer in the modern school of analytical jurisprudence,&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7496&amp;context=penn_law_review Modern Analytical Jurisprudence and the Limits of Its Usefulness], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; though its history goes back at least to [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Analytical jurisprudence is not to be mistaken for [[legal formalism]] (the idea that legal reasoning is or can be modelled as a mechanical, algorithmic process). Indeed, it was the analytical jurists who first pointed out that legal formalism is fundamentally mistaken as a theory of law.

Analytic, or 'clarificatory' jurisprudence uses a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected [[natural law]]'s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' that people invariably slip between describing that the world is a certain way to saying therefore we ought to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world is, must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative [[is–ought problem|ought questions]].

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "[[Definition of law|What are laws]]?"; "What is the law?"; "What is the relationship between law and [[power (social and political)|power]]?"; and, "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?" [[Legal positivism]] is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics, who offer their own interpretations.

[[Springer books]] commissioned essays on analytical jurisprudence for ''A Treatise on Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence''. {{ISBN|9781402033872}}

'''Anticipatory democracy''' is a theory of [[civics]] relying on democratic [[decision making]] that takes into account [[futurology|predictions of future events]] that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in his book ''[[Future Shock]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=qsPgTpt_jrKEB5CI0IAF&amp;ct=result&amp;id=SvbQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Anticipatory+democracy%22&amp;q=Toffler#search_anchor | title=Anticipatory democracy | work=The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 26 | date=1980 | accessdate=December 8, 2011 | pages=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was expanded on in the 1978 book ''Anticipatory Democracy'', edited by [[Clement Bezold]].

Other well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Heidi Toffler]], [[K. Eric Drexler]], and [[Robin Hanson]]. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this "anticipation".

The FutureMAP program of the [[Information Awareness Office]] program of the [[United States of America|United States]] government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.

== Variants ==

[[Bioregional democracy]] can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the [[ecological health]] outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.

An alternative, [[deliberative democracy]], may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model.  It relies less on formal models and a [[market system]] for betting on future events, and more on discussion.

Deliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of [[participatory democracy]] with different thresholds of ease of participation, [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants' tolerances versus preferences or ideals of [[truth]].  Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more [[left-wing politics|"left"]] and an anticipatory model as more [[right-wing politics|"right"]]. Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. [[Green politics|Greens]], usually prefer the generic term "[[participatory democracy]]". This term has become fundamental to [[green politics]] itself.
 
Other terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: [[grassroots democracy]], [[semi-direct democracy]], [[consensus democracy]].

'''Atmospheric refraction''' is the deviation of [[light]] or other [[electromagnetic wave]] from a straight line as it passes through the [[atmosphere]] due to the variation in [[air density]] as a function of [[height]].&lt;ref&gt;It is common in studies of refraction to use the term ''height'' to express vertical distance above the ground, or ''[[Geodetic datum#Vertical datum|vertical datum]]'' and ''[[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]]'' to express angular height above the [[horizon]].&lt;/ref&gt; This refraction is due to the velocity of light through [[air]], decreasing (the [[refractive index]] increases) with increased density. Atmospheric [[refraction]] near the ground produces [[mirage]]s. Such refraction can also [[looming and similar refraction phenomena|raise or lower]], or stretch or shorten, the images of distant objects without involving mirages. [[turbulence|Turbulent]] air can make distant objects appear to [[twinkling|twinkle or shimmer]]. The term also applies to the [[refraction of sound]]. Atmospheric refraction is considered in measuring the position of both celestial and terrestrial objects.

Astronomical or celestial refraction causes [[astronomical object]]s to appear higher above the horizon than they actually are. Terrestrial refraction usually causes terrestrial objects to [[Mirage#Superior mirage|appear higher]] than they actually are, although in the afternoon when the air near the ground is heated, the rays can curve upward making objects [[Mirage#Inferior mirage|appear lower]] than they actually are.

Refraction not only affects visible light rays, but all [[electromagnetic radiation]], although in varying degrees. For example, in the [[visible spectrum]], blue is more affected than red. This may cause astronomical objects to appear [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] into a spectrum in high-resolution images.

[[File:The Swimming Moon.jpg|thumb|The atmosphere refracts the image of a [[lunar phase|waxing]] crescent [[Moon]] as it sets into the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Swimming Moon |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1648a/ |website=www.eso.org |access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Whenever possible, [[astronomer]]s will schedule their observations around the times of [[culmination]], when celestial objects are highest in the sky. Likewise, sailors will not shoot a star below 20° above the horizon. If observations of objects near the horizon cannot be avoided, it is possible to equip an [[optical telescope]] with control systems to compensate for the shift caused by the refraction. If the dispersion is also a problem (in case of broadband high-resolution observations), atmospheric refraction correctors (made from pairs of rotating glass [[prism]]s) can be employed as well.

Since the amount of atmospheric refraction is a function of the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]], [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[humidity]] (the amount of [[water vapor]], which is especially important at mid-[[infrared]] wavelengths), the amount of effort needed for a successful compensation can be prohibitive. Surveyors, on the other hand, will often schedule their observations in the afternoon, when the magnitude of refraction is minimum.

Atmospheric refraction becomes more severe when temperature gradients are strong, and refraction is not uniform when the atmosphere is heterogeneous, as when [[turbulence]] occurs in the air. This causes suboptimal [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions, such as the [[twinkling]] of [[star]]s and various deformations of the [[Sun]]'s apparent shape soon before [[sunset]] or after [[sunrise]].

==Astronomical refraction==

'''Astronomical refraction''' deals with the angular position of celestial bodies, their appearance as a point source, and through differential refraction, the shape of extended bodies such as the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | pages = 282–284 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Values===
Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the [[zenith]], less than 1&amp;prime; (one [[arcminute|arc-minute]]) at 45° apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]], and still only 5.3&amp;prime; at 10° altitude; it quickly increases as altitude decreases, reaching 9.9′ at 5° altitude, 18.4′ at 2° altitude, and 35.4′ at the [[horizon]];&lt;ref name=Allen1976 /&gt; all values are for 10&amp;nbsp;°C and 1013.25&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|hPa]]
in the visible part of the spectrum.

On the horizon refraction is slightly greater than the apparent diameter of the Sun, so when the bottom of the sun's disc appears to touch the horizon, the sun's true altitude is negative. If the atmosphere suddenly vanished at this moment, one couldn't see the sun, as it would be entirely below the horizon. By convention, [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] refer to times at which the Sun’s upper limb appears on or disappears from the horizon and the standard value for the Sun’s true altitude is &amp;minus;50&amp;prime;: &amp;minus;34&amp;prime; for the refraction and &amp;minus;16&amp;prime; for the Sun’s [[semidiameter|semi-diameter]]. The altitude of a celestial body is normally given for the center of the body’s disc. In the case of the [[Moon]], additional corrections are needed for the Moon’s [[Parallax#Lunar parallax|horizontal parallax]] and its apparent semi-diameter; both vary with the Earth–Moon distance.

Refraction near the horizon is highly variable, principally because of the variability of the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]] near the Earth's surface and the geometric sensitivity of the nearly horizontal rays to this variability. As early as 1830, [[Friedrich Bessel]] had found that even after applying all corrections for temperature and pressure (but not for the temperature gradient) at the observer, highly precise measurements of refraction varied by ±0.19&amp;prime; at two degrees above the horizon and by ±0.50&amp;prime; at a half degree above the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fletcher | first = Alan | date = 1952 | title = Astronomical Refraction at Low Altitudes in Marine Navigation | journal = Navigation | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | publisher = The Institute of Navigation | place = London | pages = 314–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At and below the horizon, values of refraction significantly higher than the nominal value of 35.4′ have been observed in a wide range of climates. Georg Constantin Bouris measured refraction of as much of 4° for stars on the horizon at the [[National Observatory of Athens|Athens Observatory]]&lt;ref name = Young2004/&gt; and, during his ill-fated [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance expedition]], [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] recorded refraction of 2°37&amp;prime;:&lt;ref name=Shackleton1919 /&gt;

“The sun which had made ‘positively his last appearance’ seven days earlier surprised us by lifting more than half its disk above the horizon on May 8. A glow on the northern horizon resolved itself into the sun at 11 am that day. A quarter of an hour later the unreasonable visitor disappeared again, only to rise again at 11:40 am, set at 1 pm, rise at 1:10 pm and set lingeringly at 1:20 pm. These curious phenomena were due to refraction which amounted to 2° 37′ at 1:20 pm. The temperature was 15° below 0° Fahr., and we calculated that the refraction was 2° above normal.”

Day-to-day variations in the weather will affect the exact times of sunrise and sunset&lt;ref name=SchaeferLiller1990 /&gt; as well as moon-rise and moon-set, and for that reason it generally is not meaningful to give rise and set times to greater precision than the nearest minute.&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt; More precise calculations can be useful for determining day-to-day changes in rise and set times that would occur with the standard value for refraction{{refn|group=note|For an example see Meeus 2002&lt;ref name=Meeus2002 /&gt;}} if it is understood that actual changes may differ because of unpredictable variations in refraction.

Because atmospheric refraction is nominally 34&amp;prime; on the horizon, but only 29&amp;prime; at 0.5° above it, the setting or rising sun seems to be flattened by about 5&amp;prime; (about 1/6 of its apparent diameter).

===Calculating refraction===

Young&lt;ref name = Young2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Young2006 /&gt; distinguished several regions where different methods for calculating astronomical refraction were applicable. In the upper portion of the sky, with a [[zenith distance]] of less than 70° (or an altitude over 20°), various simple refraction formulas based on the index of refraction (and hence on the temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the observer are adequate. Between 20° and 5° of the horizon the temperature gradient becomes the dominant factor and numerical integration, using a method such as that of Auer and Standish&lt;ref name=AuerStandish2000 /&gt; and employing the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]] of the [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] and the measured conditions at the observer, is required. Closer to the horizon, actual measurements of the changes with height of the local temperature gradient need to be employed in the numerical integration. Below the astronomical horizon, refraction is so variable that only crude estimates of astronomical refraction can be made; for example, the observed time of sunrise or sunset can vary by several minutes from day to day. As ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' notes, "the actual values of …the refraction at low altitudes may, in extreme atmospheric conditions, differ considerably from the mean values used in the tables."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 1986 | title = The nautical almanac for the year 1988 | publisher = United States Naval Observatory / Her Majesty's Stationery Office | place = Washington / London | page = 261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BennettAtmRefractVsAlt.png|thumb|right|Plot of refraction vs. altitude using Bennett’s 1982 formula]]

Many different formulas have been developed for calculating astronomical refraction; they are reasonably consistent, differing among themselves by a few minutes of arc at the horizon and becoming increasingly consistent as they approach the zenith. The simpler formulations involved nothing more than the temperature and pressure at the observer, powers of the [[cotangent]] of the ''apparent'' altitude of the astronomical body and in the higher order terms, the height of a fictional homogeneous atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fletcher | first = A. | date = 1952 | title = Astronomical Refraction at Low Altitudes in Marine Navigation | journal = The Journal of Navigation | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | publisher = Royal Institute of Navigation | place = London | pages = 307–330 | issn = 1469-7785 | doi = 10.1017/S0373463300045033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wittmann | first = A.

M. | author-link = William Marshall Smart | title = Text-Book on Spherical Astronomy | year = 1977 | edition=sixth | pages = 61–62 | isbn = 0-521-29180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = W&amp;C&gt;{{Citation | last = Woolard | first = Edgar W. | author-link = Edgar W. Woolard | last2 = Clemence | first2 = Gerald M. | author2-link = Gerald M. Clemence | date = 1966 | title = Spherical Astronomy | publisher = Academic Press | place = New York and London | pages = 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = (n_0 - 1) \cot h_\mathrm{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the refraction in [[radians]], ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[index of refraction]] at the observer (which depends on the temperature and pressure), and ''h&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''apparent'' altitude of the astronomical body.

An early simple approximation of this form, which directly incorporated the temperature and pressure at the observer, was developed by [[George Comstock (astronomer)|George Comstock]]:&lt;ref name = Comstock1890&gt;{{citation | last=Comstock | first=George C.  | title= A Simple Approximate Formula for Refraction | volume = 9 | journal = Sidereal Messenger | date=1890 | page = 186 | bibcode = 1890SidM....9..185. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac {21.5 b} {273 + t} \cot h_\mathrm{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the refraction in seconds of arc, ''b'' is the barometric pressure in [[millimeters of mercury]], and ''t'' is the [[Celsius]] temperature. Comstock considered that this formula gave results within one arcsecond of [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]]'s values for refraction from 15° above the horizon to the zenith.&lt;ref name = Comstock1890 /&gt;

A further expansion in terms of the third power of the cotangent of the apparent altitude incorporates ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the height of the homogenous atmosphere, in addition to the usual conditions at the observer:&lt;ref name = W&amp;C/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = (n_0 - 1)(1 -H_0) \cot h_\mathrm{a} - (n_0 - 1)[H_0 - \frac{1}{2}(n_0 - 1)]\cot^3h_\mathrm{a} .&lt;/math&gt;

A version of this formula is used in the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s ''Standards of Fundamental Astronomy''; a comparison of the IAU's algorithm with more rigorous ray-tracing procedures indicated an agreement within 60 [[Minute and second of arc|milliarcseconds]] at altitudes above 15°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 2014 | title = Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy; SOFA Astrometry Tools | edition = Software version 11; Document 1.6 | publisher = International Astronomical Union | pages = 12, 71–73 | url = http://www.iausofa.org/sofa_ast_f.pdf | accessdate = 23 June 2016 | quote = The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for refraction, which use a simple A tan ζ + B tan&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ζ model. Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed coordinates should be within 0".05 (optical) 1"(radio) for ζ &lt; 70°, better than 30" (optical or radio) at 85° and better than 0°.3 (optical) or 0°.5 (radio) at the horizon.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett&lt;ref name=Bennett1982 /&gt; developed another simple empirical formula for calculating refraction from the apparent altitude which gives the refraction ''R'' in arcminutes:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \cot \left ( h_\mathrm{a} + \frac {7.31} {h_\mathrm{a} + 4.4} \right ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used in the [[United States Naval Observatory|U. S. Naval Observatory]]'s ''Vector Astrometry Software'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kaplan | first = G. H. | date = 21 March 2011 | title = NOVAS Fortran source code, Vers. F3.1 | chapter = SUBROUTINE REFRAC | type = Computer Program | publisher = U. S.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; more complex algorithm within 0.07′ over the entire range from the zenith to the horizon.&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett1982/&gt; Sæmundsson&lt;ref name=Saemundsson1986 /&gt; developed an inverse formula for determining refraction from ''true'' altitude; if ''h'' is the true altitude in degrees, refraction ''R'' in arcminutes is given by

:&lt;math&gt;R = 1.02 \cot \left ( h + \frac {10.3} {h + 5.11} \right ) \,;&lt;/math&gt;

the formula is consistent with Bennett’s to within 0.1′. The formulas of Bennet and Sæmundsson assume an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 101.0&amp;nbsp;kPa and a temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C; for different pressure ''P'' and temperature ''T'', refraction calculated from these formulas is multiplied by&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {P} {101} \, \frac {283} {273 + T} &lt;/math&gt;

Refraction increases approximately 1% for every 0.9&amp;nbsp;kPa increase in pressure, and decreases approximately 1% for every 0.9&amp;nbsp;kPa decrease in pressure. Similarly, refraction increases approximately 1% for every 3&amp;nbsp;°C decrease in temperature, and decreases approximately 1% for every 3&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature.

===Random refraction effects===
[[File:Seeing Moon.gif|frame|right|The animated image of the [[Moon]]'s surface shows the [[twinkling|effects]] of atmospheric [[turbulence]] on the view.]]

[[Turbulence]] in [[Earth's atmosphere]] [[light scattering|scatters]] the light from stars, making them appear brighter and fainter on a time-scale of [[millisecond]]s. The slowest components of these fluctuations are visible as [[twinkling]] (also called ''scintillation'').

Turbulence also causes small, sporadic motions of the star image, and produces rapid distortions in its structure. These effects are not visible to the [[naked eye]], but can be easily seen even in small telescopes. They perturb [[astronomical seeing]] conditions.

==Terrestrial refraction==

'''Terrestrial refraction''', sometimes called '''geodetic refraction''', deals with the apparent angular position and measured distance of terrestrial bodies. It is of special concern for the production of precise [[Cartography|maps]] and [[Surveying|surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | pages = 42–48, 233–243 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the line of sight in terrestrial refraction passes near the earth's surface, the magnitude of refraction depends chiefly on the temperature gradient near the ground, which varies widely at different times of day, seasons of the year, the nature of the terrain, the state of the weather, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Woolard | first = Edgar W. | author-link = Edgar W. Woolard | last2 = Clemence | first2 = Gerald M. | author2-link = Gerald M. Clemence | date = 1966 | title = Spherical Astronomy | publisher = Academic Press | place = New York and London | page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a common approximation, terrestrial refraction is considered as a constant bending of the ray of light or line of sight, in which the ray can be considered as describing a circular path. A common measure of refraction is the coefficient of refraction. Unfortunately there are two different definitions of this coefficient. One is the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight,&lt;ref name=Hirt2010&gt;{{Citation | last = Hirt | first = Christian | last2 = Guillaume | first2 = Sebastian | last3 = Wisbar | first3 = Annemarie | last4 = Bürki | first4 = Beat | last5 = Sternberg | first5 = Harald | date = 2010 | title = Monitoring of the refraction coefficient in the lower atmosphere using a controlled setup of simultaneous reciprocal vertical angle measurements | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 115 | publisher = American Geophysical Union | pages = D21102 | doi = 10.1029/2010JD014067|bibcode = 2010JGRD..11521102H }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other is the ratio of the angle that the line of sight subtends at the center of the Earth to the angle of refraction measured at the observer.&lt;ref name=Bomford1980_236&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | page = 236 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the latter definition only measures the bending of the ray at one end of the line of sight, it is one half the value of the former definition.

The coefficient of refraction is directly related to the local vertical temperature gradient and the atmospheric temperature and pressure. The larger version of the coefficient ''k'', measuring the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight, is given by:&lt;ref name=Hirt2010/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k =  503 \frac{P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0343 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ), &lt;/math&gt;

where temperature ''T'' is given in [[kelvin]]s, pressure ''P'' in [[Bar (unit)|millibars]], and height ''h'' in meters. The angle of refraction increases with the coefficient of refraction and with the length of the line of sight.

Although the straight line from your eye to a distant mountain might be blocked by a closer hill, the ray may curve enough to make the distant peak visible. A convenient method to analyze the effect of refraction on visibility is to consider an increased effective radius of the Earth ''R&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'', given by&lt;ref name=Young2006/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{eff} = \frac {R} {1 - k} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth and ''k'' is the coefficient of refraction. Under this model the ray can be considered a straight line on an Earth of increased radius.

The curvature of the refracted ray in [[arc seconds]] per meter can be computed using the relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | page = 235 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {\sigma} =  16.3 \frac{P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0342 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ) \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where 1/σ is the curvature of the ray in arcsec per meter, ''P'' is the pressure in millibars, ''T'' is the temperature in kelvins, and β is the angle of the ray to the horizontal. Multiplying half the curvature by the length of the ray path gives the angle of refraction at the observer. For a line of sight near the horizon cos β differs little from unity and can be ignored. This yields

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega = 8.15 \frac{L P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0342 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the length of the line of sight in meters and Ω is the refraction at the observer measured in arc seconds.

A simple approximation is to consider that a mountain's apparent altitude at your eye (in degrees) will exceed its true altitude by its distance in kilometers divided by 1500. This assumes a fairly horizontal line of sight and ordinary air density; if the mountain is very high (so much of the sightline is in thinner air) divide by 1600 instead.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12539">'''Augmented learning''' is an on-demand [[learning]] technique where the environment adapts to the learner. By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/an-interview-with-mcgraw-hill-higher-education-president-brian-kibby-about-the-future-of-ebooks-tctv/ Augmented learning and super-adaptive learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies incorporating [[rich media]] and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing.  Instead of focusing on [[memorization]], the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.

Most implementations of augmented learning are forms of e-learning. In desktop computing environments, the learner receives supplemental, contextual information through an on-screen, pop-up window, [[toolbar]] or [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar]]. As the user navigates a website, e-mail or document, the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse, touch or other input device. In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones.

Augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence ([[intelligence amplification]]) and [[augmented reality]]. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through [[distributed cognition]]. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success. Mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the [[abacus]], calculator, personal computers and smart phones. Software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user. When an individual's name appears on the screen, a pop-up window could display person's organizational affiliation, contact information and most recent interactions.

In mobile reality systems,&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; the annotation may appear on the learner's individual "heads-up display" or through headphones for audio instruction. For example, apps for Google Glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click-throughs, .&lt;ref name="Augmented Reality"&gt;[http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ Augmented Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407044513/http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper-and-pen-based exercises. For example, augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter, allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters. See [[#Understanding language|Understanding language]], below.

==Just-in-time understanding and learning==
Augmentation tools can help learners understand issues, acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or "on demand." This contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning, including [[rote learning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[observational learning]], where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned.

Snyder and Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf Computer Augmented Learning: The Basis of Sustained Knowledge Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221021/http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that just-in-time learning is not sufficient. Long-term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths.

==Understanding language==
Augmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language. The interactive, dynamic nature of these on-demand language assistants can provide definitions, sample sentences and even audible pronunciations. When sentences or blocks of text are selected, the words are read aloud  while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics. Speech rate control can tailor the text-to-speech (TTS) to keep pace with the learner's comprehension.

== Understanding Science ==
Augmented reality has come a long way in the science field, but it is still in its infancy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2012-08-03|title=Affordances of Augmented Reality in Science Learning: Suggestions for Future Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=449–462|doi=10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|issn=1059-0145}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have started using webcams, making them read a certain marker label, then an object where the label would be comes up on the screen. Developers are continuing to gather information on how AR ([[augmented reality]]) could take it's part in the learning environment. Over the past few years there have been technologies added to the classroom such as computers, laptops, projectors, white boards and much more. It is allowing students to be more engaged in what is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Students are also now able to take notes without having to listening to what the teacher is saying, but instead writing what they typed on the projector.&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer" /&gt; The notes can be more thorough and to the point, rather than an entire explanation. With the help of AR we can also see pictures on the board showing students the space in between certain objects such as planets or atoms.

==Making learning fun==
One researcher&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer"&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 Klopfer, Eric] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223005434/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 |date=December 23, 2008 }}, Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines (Game Boy, PlayStation Portable) can make an impact on learning. These mobile devices excel in their portability, context sensitivity, connectivity and ubiquity. By incorporating social dynamics in a real-world context, learning games can create compelling environments for learners.

At the [[Allard Pierson Museum]] in Amsterdam, visitors view information on-demand at the "A Future for the Past" exhibit. In a virtual reconstruction of [[Satricum]] and the Forum Romanum, users can call up information that is overlaid on room-sized photos and other images. The museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest.&lt;ref name="Augmented reality"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/augmented-reality-on-hand-at-museum-in-the-netherlands-threaten/ Flatley, Joseph L.], Augmented reality at the Allard Pierson Museum in Netherland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is augmentation really "learning"?==
Critics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization; similar arguments have been made about using [[calculators]] in the past. Just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding, augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall, present and process information.

Current research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective.&lt;ref name="cell-neuron"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans |last1=Seitz |first1=Aaron R. |last2=Kim |first2=Dongho |last3=Watanabe |first3=Takeo |journal=Neuron |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=700–707 |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(09)00083-X |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual stimuli, rendered in flashes of information, showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies.

== Augmented Learning in Education ==
Augmented learning has allowed not only students to learn, but also their parents. Tools like mobile games have made it easier for parents to understand more fully what their child is learning in school. Technology brings the childs content to a new platform which is helpful to parents when trying to make meaningful connections to what their child is learning in school. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I0kaFNaK704C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=augmented+learning+in+science&amp;ots=_fcI-rZGZ7&amp;sig=Va6-WbBonsgG0kEb8wcmAotXmu0#v=onepage&amp;q=augmented%20learning%20in%20science&amp;f=false|title=Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games|last=Klopfer|first=Eric|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262113151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, augmented reality has brought a new way of learning to young children to have the ability to articulate words. By using marker labels in books that are read by a tablet, making pictures appear on the screen along with audio narration for enhanced reading. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2014-11-11|title=The interaction of child-parent shared reading with an augmented reality (AR) picture book and parents' conceptions of AR learning|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjet.12228|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=203–222|doi=10.1111/bjet.12228|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]] in education has the potential to change the timing and location of the conventional learning process. This style of learning introduces new methods of studying. With the boom of [[technology]] and younger students being the biggest users, the learning platform has the ability to connect this generation and their smartphones to gain knowledge. Though it has yet to be fully discovered, Augmented Reality in education is looking to become a large market.

This style of learning can gain attention and expand the students interest in subject and topics he would not learn or come across in the conventional classroom lecture. Extra data such as fun facts, visual models, or historical data from events could give a wider understanding of the topics being taught. The learning platform hopes to explain abstract concepts, engage and interact with the learner, and discover and learn additional information about what they what to learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Barsanti-Matteucci engine''' was the first [[internal combustion engine]]. In late 1851 or early 1852 [[Eugenio Barsanti]], a professor of [[mathematics]], and [[Felice Matteucci]], an [[engineer]] and expert in [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], joined forces on a project to exploit the [[explosion]] and [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a gaseous mix of [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric air to transform part of the energy of such explosions into [[mechanical energy]].

==Origin==
The idea originated almost ten years earlier with Barsanti when, as a young man, he was teaching at St. Michael's College in [[Volterra]], Italy. An engineer from [[Milan]] Italy, Luigi de Cristoforis, described in a paper published in the acts of the Lombard Royal Institute of Science, Literature and Art, a pneumatic machine (later built and shown to work) that ran on [[naphtha]] and an air mixture, and which constituted the first liquid fuel engine.

==Prototypes==
During the twelve years of collaboration between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of [[internal combustion engine]]s were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of [[air]] and [[hydrogen]] or an [[illuminating gas]] shot a [[piston]] upwards thereby creating a [[vacuum]] in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to the action of the [[atmospheric pressure]], it turned a toothed rod connected to a [[sprocket]] wheel and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.
  
==Patents==
Numerous [[patent]]s were obtained by the two [[inventor]]s: the 1854 English&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=185701655A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18571201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; and Piedmont patents, the 1861 Piedmont patent of Barsanti, Matteucci and Babacci which was then used as a base to construct the engine of the [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]] company of [[Zurich]] and put on exhibit during the first National Expo of Florence in 1861, and the 1861 English patent.

== History ==

Biopython development began in 1999 and it was first released in July 2000.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=The Biopython Project: Philosophy, functionality and facts |url=http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/presentations/biopython_exelixis.pdf |date=11 March 2004 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed during a similar time frame and with analogous goals to other projects that added bioinformatics capabilities to their respective programming languages, including [[BioPerl]], [[BioRuby]] and [[BioJava]]. Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date.&lt;ref name="Contributors"&gt;{{Citation |title=List of Biopython contributors |url=http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140911121354/http://biopython.org/SRC/biopython/CONTRIB |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a similar [[Python (programming language)|Python]] project, namely '''PyCogent''', was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see [[#Key features and examples|Key features and examples]]).

As of version 1.62, Biopython supports running on Python 3 as well as Python 2.&lt;ref name="Installation"&gt;{{Citation | first = Brad | last = Chapman |title=Biopython Installation |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; objects can be manipulated via [[Array slicing#1991: Python|slicing]], in a manner similar to Python’s strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl.&lt;ref name="Chapman2004"/&gt;

Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.&lt;ref name="lists"/&gt;

== Key features and examples ==

=== Sequences ===
A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;ref name="Tutorial"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chang |first=Jeff |last2=Chapman |first2=Brad |last3=Friedberg |first3=Iddo |last4=Hamelryck |first4=Thomas |last5=de Hoon |first5=Michiel |last6=Cock |first6=Peter |last7=Antao |first7=Tiago |last8=Talevich |first8=Eric |last9=Wilczynski |first9=Bartek  |title=Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook |url=http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html |date=29 May 2014 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Biopython &lt;code&gt;Seq&lt;/code&gt; object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence = Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence
Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence[2:7]
Seq('GCTTC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna_sequence.reverse_complement()
Seq('TACGAGAAGCCT', IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence
Seq('AGGCUUCUCGUA', IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
&gt;&gt;&gt; rna_sequence.translate()
Seq('RLLV', IUPACProtein())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Sequence annotation ===
The &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt; class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Each &lt;code&gt;SeqFeature&lt;/code&gt; object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‘gene’, ‘CDS’ (coding sequence), ‘repeat_region’, ‘mobile_element’ or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record = SeqIO.read('pTC2.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.name
'NC_019375'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.description
'Providencia stuartii plasmid pTC2, complete sequence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.features[14]
SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(ExactPosition(4516), ExactPosition(5336), strand=1), type='mobile_element')
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq_record.seq
Seq('GGATTGAATATAACCGACGTGACTGTTACATTTAGGTGGCTAAACCCGTCAAGC...GCC', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Input and output ===
Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including [[FASTA format|FASTA]], [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]], GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and [[Nexus file|NEXUS]].  When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as &lt;code&gt;SeqRecord&lt;/code&gt;.  This allows records of one file format to be converted into others.

Very large sequence files can exceed a computer's memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files.  They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or [[Associative array|dictionaries]], providing fast access at the cost of memory usage.  Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; genomes = SeqIO.parse('salmonella.gb', 'genbank')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for genome in genomes:
...     SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + '.fasta', 'fasta')
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Accessing online databases ===

Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases.  Each of the functions provided by the [[Entrez]] search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pycon"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import Entrez
&gt;&gt;&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_file = open('all_records.fasta', "w")
&gt;&gt;&gt; Entrez.email = 'my_email@example.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; records_to_download = ['FO834906.1', 'FO203501.1']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for record_id in records_to_download:
...     handle = Entrez.efetch(db='nucleotide', id=record_id, rettype='gb')
...     seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format='gb')
...     handle.close()
...     output_file.write(seqRecord.format('fasta'))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Phylogeny ===

[[File:Phylo.draw.png|thumb|300px|Figure 1: A rooted phylogenetic tree created by Bio.Phylo showing the relationship between different organisms' Apaf-1 homologs&lt;ref name="Zmasek2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zmasek |first=Christian M |last2=Zhang |first2=Qing |last3=Ye |first3=Yuzhen |last4=Godzik |first4=Adam |date=24 October 2007 |title=Surprising complexity of the ancestral apoptosis network |url=http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R226 |journal=Genome Biology |publisher= |volume=8 |issue=10 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r226 |pages=R226 |pmid=17958905 |pmc=2246300}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Phylo.draw graphviz.png|thumb|Figure 2: The same tree as above, drawn unrooted using Graphviz via Bio.Phylo]]

The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising [[phylogenetic tree]]s.  A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including [[Newick format|Newick]], [[Nexus file|NEXUS]] and [[phyloXML]].  Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Clade&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree's root, and analysing branch features such as length or score.&lt;ref name="Talevich2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talevich |first=Eric |last2=Invergo |first2=Brandon M |last3=Cock |first3=Peter JA |last4=Chapman |first4=Brad A |date=21 August 2012 |title=Bio.Phylo: A unified toolkit for processing, analyzing and visualizing phylogenetic trees in Biopython |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/209 |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=209 |accessdate=9 September 2014 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-13-209 |pmid=22909249 |pmc=3468381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted trees can be drawn in [[ASCII art|ASCII]] or using [[matplotlib]] (see Figure 1), and the [[Graphviz]] library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).

=== Genome diagrams ===

[[File:PKPS77.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3: A diagram of the genes on the pKPS77 plasmid,&lt;ref name="NC_023330.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_023330.1 |title=Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPS77 plasmid pKPS77, complete sequence |date= |website= |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; visualised using the GenomeDiagram module in Biopython]]

The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython.&lt;ref name="Pritchard2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pritchard |first=Leighton |last2=White |first2=Jennifer A |last3=Birch |first3=Paul RJ |last4=Toth |first4=Ian K |title=GenomeDiagram: a python package for the visualization of large-scale genomic data |journal=Bioinformatics |date=March 2006 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=616–617 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btk021 |pmid=16377612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]].  Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks.  By looping over a sequence's features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram's tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram.  Cross-links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.

=== Macromolecular structure ===

The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB]] and [[Crystallographic Information File|mmCIF]] files, and was added to Biopython in 2003.&lt;ref name="Hamelryck2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamelryck |first=Thomas |last2=Manderick |first2=Bernard |date=10 May 2003 |title=PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/17/2308 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=19 |issue=17 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg299 |pages=2308–2310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: &lt;code&gt;Structure&lt;/code&gt; objects contain &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Chain&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Residue&lt;/code&gt; objects which contain &lt;code&gt;Atom&lt;/code&gt; objects.  Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, &lt;code&gt;DisorderedResidue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DisorderedAtom&lt;/code&gt;, that describe their uncertain positions.

Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein.  Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.

=== Population genetics ===

The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics.&lt;ref name="Rousset2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rousset |first=François |date=January 2008 |title=GENEPOP'007: a complete re-implementation of the GENEPOP software for Windows and Linux |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x/abstract |journal=Molecular Ecology Resources |publisher= |volume=8 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01931.x |pages=103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for analyses of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium]], [[linkage disequilibrium]] and other features of a population's [[Allele frequency|allele frequencies]].

This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using [[coalescent theory]] with the fastsimcoal2 program.&lt;ref name="Excoffier2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Excoffier |first=Laurent |last2=Foll |first2=Matthieu |date=1 March 2011 |title=fastsimcoal: a continuous-time coalescent simulator of genomic diversity under arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/9/1332 |journal=Bioinformatics |publisher= |volume=27 |issue=9 |accessdate=11 September 2014 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr124 |pages=1332–1334 |pmid=21398675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wrappers for command line tools ===

Many of Biopython's modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython.  These wrappers include [[BLAST]], [[Clustal]], PhyML, [[EMBOSS]] and [[SAMtools]].  Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

[[Image:Yellow-rattle close 700.jpg|thumb|right|Papery (upper) and leafy bracts on hay rattle (''[[Rhinanthus minor]]'').  All the "leaves" in this image are bracts.]]
In [[botany]], a '''bract''' is a modified or specialized [[leaf]], especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a [[flower]], [[inflorescence]] axis or [[cone scale]]. Bracts are often (but not always) different from foliage leaves. They may be smaller, larger, or of a different color, shape, or texture. Typically, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals or [[sepals]]. The state of having bracts is referred to as '''bracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|title=the definition of bracteate|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428051604/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bracteate|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bracteolate''', and conversely the state of lacking them is referred to as '''ebracteate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|title=Definition of Ebractate|website=www.greengonzo.com|access-date=2017-04-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428052240/http://www.greengonzo.com/dictionary/Ebractiate.html|archivedate=2017-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ebracteolate''', without bracts.

==Variants==

Some bracts are brightly-coloured and serve the function of attracting pollinators, either together with the [[perianth]] or instead of it. Examples of this type of bract include ''[[Euphorbia pulcherrima]]'' (poinsettia) and ''[[Bougainvillea]]'': both of these have large colourful bracts surrounding much smaller, less colourful flowers.

In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, called the '''lemma''' (lower bract) and '''palea''' (upper bract), while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called '''glumes'''.  These bracts form the [[chaff]] removed from [[cereal]] grain during [[threshing]] and [[winnowing]].

Bats may detect acoustic signals from dish-shaped bracts such as those of ''[[Marcgravia evenia]]''.&lt;ref name=Simon11&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ralph Simon|author2=Marc W. Holderied|author3=Corinna U. Koch|author4=Otto von Helversen|title=Floral acoustics: Conspicuous echoes of a dish-shaped leaf attract bat pollinators|journal=Science|volume= 333| issue=6042|pages=631–633|DOI=10.1126/science.1204210|pmid=21798950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prophyll''' is a leaf-like structure, such as a bracteole, subtending (extending under) a single flower or [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The term can also mean the lower bract on a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]].

The frequently showy pair of bracts of ''[[Euphorbia]]'' species in subgenus ''Lacanthis'' are the '''cyathophylls'''.

Bracts subtend the cone scales in the seed cones of many [[conifer]]s, and in some cases, such as ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'', they extend beyond the cone scales.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Bracteole==
A small bract is called a '''bracteole''' or '''bractlet'''. Technically this is any bract that arises ''on'' a pedicel instead of subtending it.

== Involucral bracts ==
[[Image:Leafy-bract-Beggar-ticks.we.jpg|100px|right|thumb|Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'')]]

Bracts that appear in a [[Whorl (botany)|whorl]] subtending an [[inflorescence]] are collectively called an '''involucre'''. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many [[Apiaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Dipsacaceae]] and [[Polygonaceae]]. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of bracts, in this case called an '''involucel'''. In this case they may be called ''chaff'', ''paleas'', or ''receptacular bracts'' and are usually minute scales or bristles.  Many [[Asteraceae|asteraceous]] plants have bracts at the base of each inflorescence.

The term involucre is also used for a highly conspicuous bract or bract pair at the base of an inflorescence. In the family [[Betulaceae]], notably in the genera ''[[hornbeam|Carpinus]]'' and ''[[hazel|Corylus]]'', the '''involucre''' is a leafy structure that protects the developing nuts. Beggar-tick (''[[Bidens comosa]]'') has narrow involucral bracts surrounding each inflorescence, each of which also has a single bract below it. There is then a pair of leafy bracts on the main stem and below those a pair of leaves.

==Epicalyx==
[[Image:Hibiscus rosa-sinensis3 ies.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Epicalyx of ''[[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis]]'']]
 
An epicalyx, which forms an additional whorl around the [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of a single flower, is a modification of bracteoles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darpan|first=Pratiyogita|title=Competition Science Vision|date=June 2006|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the epicalyx is a ''group of bracts resembling a calyx'' or ''bracteoles forming a whorl outer to the calyx''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/books/12/std12-botany-em.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214091359/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/12/Std12-Botany-EM.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a calyx-like extra whorl of floral appendages.  Each individual segment of the epicalyx is called an '''episepal''' because they resemble the sepals in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |title=epicalyx – Dictionary of botany |publisher=Botanydictionary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120501223013/http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |archivedate=2012-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are present in the [[Malvaceae]], the ''Hibiscus'' family. ''[[Fragaria]]'' (strawberries) may or may not have an epicalyx.
{{clear}}

==Spathe==
[[Image:Anthurium scherzerianum 2.jpg|right|100px|thumb|''[[Anthurium]] scherzerianum'' [[inflorescence]] with spathe and [[spadix (botany)|spadix]]]]

A ''spathe'' is a large bract or pair of bracts forming a sheath to enclose the flower cluster of such plants as [[Arecaceae|palm]]s, [[arum]]s, [[Iris (plant)|irises]],&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Richard Lynch {{Google books|grvYTul5CSUC|The Book of the Iris|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Casha {{Google books|Poo9CgAAQBAJ|Flora of the Maltese Islands|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dayflower]]s (''Commelina''). ''[[Habranthus tubispathus]]'' in the [[Amaryllidaceae]] derives its [[botanical nomenclature|specific name]] from its tuberous spathe. In many arums ([[Araceae]] family), the spathe is petal-like, attracting pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a [[spadix (botany)|spadix]].

'''CD133 antigen''', also known as '''prominin-1''', is a [[glycoprotein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''PROM1'' [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin AH, Miraglia S, Zanjani ED, Almeida-Porada G, Ogawa M, Leary AG, Olweus J, Kearney J, Buck DW | title = AC133, a novel marker for human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells | journal = Blood | volume = 90 | issue = 12 | pages = 5002–12 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9389720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbeil D, Fargeas CA, Huttner WB | title = Rat prominin, like its mouse and human orthologues, is a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 285 | issue = 4 | pages = 939–44 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11467842 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of pentaspan [[transmembrane]] glycoproteins, which specifically localize to cellular protrusions. When embedded in the [[cell membrane]], the [[membrane topology]] of prominin-1 is such that the [[N-terminus]] extends into the [[extracellular space]] and the [[C-terminus]] resides in the intracellular compartment. The protein consists of five transmembrane segments, with the first and second segments and the third and fourth segments connected by intracellular loops while the second and third as well as fourth and fifth transmembrane segments are connected by extracellular loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbeil D, Karbanová J, Fargeas CA, Jászai J | title = Prominin-1 (CD133): Molecular and Cellular Features Across Species | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 777 | pages = 3–24 | date = 2012-11-05 | pmid = 23161072 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-5894-4_1 | isbn = 9781461458937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the precise function of CD133 remains unknown, it has been proposed that it acts as an organizer of cell membrane topology.&lt;ref name="pmid24093054"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irollo E, Pirozzi G | title = CD133: to be or not to be, is this the real question? | journal = American Journal of Translational Research | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 563–81 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24093054 | pmc = 3786264 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California NanoSystems Institute''' ('''CNSI''') is an integrated research center operating jointly at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]]. Its missions are to foster interdisciplinary collaborations for discoveries in nanosystems and [[nanotechnology]]; train the next generation of scientists, educators and technology leaders; and facilitate partnerships with industry, fueling economic development and the social well-being of [[California]], the United States and the [[world]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} 

CNSI was created by Governor [[Gray Davis]] as part of a science and innovation initiative, it was established in 2000 with $100 million from the state of California and an additional $250 million in federal research grants and industry funding. At the institute, scientists in the areas of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, mathematics, computational science and engineering measure, modify and manipulate the building blocks of our world – [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s. These scientists benefit from an integrated laboratory culture enabling them to conduct dynamic research at the [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]], leading to significant breakthroughs in the areas of health, energy, the environment and information technology.

== History ==
On December 7, 2000, California Governor Gray Davis announced the location of the federally sponsored California NanoSystems Institute section of the [[California Institutes for Science and Innovation]] (Cal ISI) initiative. The California legislature put forth $100 million for  three research facilities to advance the future of the state's economy.&lt;ref&gt;California Launches Major Nanotechnology Research Initiative”. Foresight Update 43.December 20, 2000. &lt;http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html&gt;. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019170748/http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Update43/Update43.2.html |date=2008-10-19 }} 13 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) was selected out of the proposals along with three other Cal ISIs: [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]] (QB3), [[California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology]] (Cal-(IT)2), and [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] (CITRIS).&lt;ref&gt;Foust, Brenda. “The California Institutes for Science and Innovation”.

The '''Center for Mathematics and Theoretical Physics''' ('''CMTP''') is an [[Italy|Italian]] institution supporting research in [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]]. The CMTP was founded on November 17, 2009 as an interdepartmental research center of the three Roman universities: [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|Tor Vergata]] and [[Roma Tre University|Roma Tre]]. The CMTP's director is Roberto Longo, from the Mathematics Department of Tor Vergata University, and its scientific secretaries are Alberto De Sole, from Sapienza University, and Alessandro Giuliani, from Roma Tre University.

The center does not have a permanent location; however, it is temporarily hosted in Tor Vergata's Mathematics Department.

The aim of the CMTP, according to its Web site, is to "take advantage of the high quality and wide spectrum of research in mathematical physics presently carried on in Roma ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' in order to promote cross fertilization of mathematics and theoretical physics at the highest level by fostering creative interactions of leading experts from both subjects."&lt;ref name="CMTP - About"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Center for Mathematics and Theoretical Physics |title=CMTP - About |accessdate=December 6, 2010 |url=http://cmtp.uniroma2.it/home_about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities of the center ==
The CMTP promotes scientific research by organizing workshops, congresses, and periods of thematic research; sending invitations to scientists; and assigning study grants. The CMTP's goal is to attract foreign scientists of international prestige and young talented foreigners to Rome by offering a natural place for scientific education and a base of cultural interchange with other scientific centers abroad.

The opening activity of the center was to present the Seminal Interactions between Mathematics and Physics conference hosted by the [[Accademia dei Lincei Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] in Rome. The invited speakers counted, among others, four [[Fields Medal|fields medalists]]; [[Alain Connes]], [[Andrei Okounkov]], [[Stanislav Smirnov]] and [[Cédric Villani|C. Villani]]; and an [[Abel prize]] winner, [[Isadore Singer]].
As part of the conference, the center organized two evening public lectures for the general audience, held by [[Ludvig Faddeev]] and [[Isadore Singer|Singer]].

Among its activities, the center runs the Levi Civita colloquia.

A '''change request''' is a [[document]] containing a call for an adjustment of a [[system]]; it is of great importance in the [[change management process]].

[[Image:Example change request.png|right|350px|'''Figure 1''': Example change request for the car industry|alt=]]

A change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out. Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID), the [[Deadline (time limit)|deadline]] (if applicable), an indication whether the change is required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a domain-specific [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and a change [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], which is a piece of narrative (Keller, 2005). An example of a change request can be found in Figure 1 on the right.

Change requests typically originate from one of five sources: 
# problem reports that identify [[Software bug|bugs]] that must be fixed, which forms the most common source
# system enhancement requests from [[User (computing)|users]]
# events in the development of other systems
# changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system)
# demands from senior management (Dennis, Wixom &amp; Tegarden, 2002).
Additionally, in [[Project Management]], change requests may also originate from an unclear understanding of the goals and the objectives of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Dave. [http://www.pmhut.com/how-to-control-change-requests "How to Control Change Requests"], ''PM Hut'', November 15, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Change requests have many different names, which essentially describe the same concept:
* Request For Change (RFC) by Rajlich (1999); RFC is also a common term in [[ITIL]] (Keller, 2005) and [[PRINCE2]] (Onna &amp; Koning, 2003).
* Engineering Change (EC) by Huang and Mak (1999);
* Engineering Change Request (ECR) at Aero (Helms, 2002);
* Engineering Change Order (ECO) by Loch and Terwiesch (1999) and Pikosz and Malmqvist (1998). Engineering Change Order is a separate step after ECR. After ECR is approved by Engineering Department then an ECO is made for making the change;
* Change Notice at Chemical (Helms, 2002);
* Action Request (AR) at ABB Robotics AB (Kajko-Mattson, 1999);
* Change Request (CR) is, among others, used by Lam (1998), Mäkäräinen (2000), Dennis, et al. (2002), Crnkovic, Asklund and Persson-Dahlqvist (2003) and at ABB Automation Products AB (Kajko-Mattsson, 1999).
* Operational Change Request (OCR).
* Enterprise Change Request (ECR).

A '''church treasure''' ({{lang-de|Kirchenschatz}}) is the collection of historical art treasures belonging to a [[church (building)|church]], usually a [[monastery]] ('''monastery treasure'''), [[abbey]], [[cathedral]]. Such "treasure" is usually held and displayed in the church's [[treasure chamber|treasury]] or in a [[diocesan museum]]. Historically the highlight of church treasures was often a collection of [[reliquaries]].

As a result of gifts and the desire to acquire sacred artifacts, many churches over the centuries gathered valuable and historic collections of [[altar plate]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s of liturgical or religious books, as well as [[vestments]], and other works of art or items of historical interest. Despite [[iconoclasm]], [[secularism]], looting, fire, the enforced sale of treasure in times of financial difficulty, theft and other losses, much of this treasure has survived or has even been repurchased.  Many large churches have been displaying their riches to visitors in some form for centuries.

'''Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs''', (or '''CAAHEP'''), is an agency of [[accreditation]]  for the accredits postsecondary education programs in 28 health science fields.

Programmatic accreditation is granted after an education program is reviewed and it is determined that the program is in compliance with the profession's accreditation Standards.&lt;ref&gt;The profession's accreditation Standards designate what an entry-level health care employee in a particular field needs to know in order to be successful in that field&lt;/ref&gt; A not-for-profit organization, CAAHEP is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). It is based in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

== Members and leadership ==

*CAAHEP's members are organizations that represent the professions accredited by CAAHEP and/or the institutions that teach CAAHEP accredited programs.
*CAAHEP's leadership is composed of both a Commission and a Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caahep.org/Member-Organizations-and-Their-Commissioners/ CAAHEP Commissioners and Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals who serve as Commissioners are representatives from CAAHEP's sponsoring organizations, along with a recent graduate of a CAAHEP accredited program and members of the general public.  The Commissioners approve the organization's mission, vision, and bylaws, and decide which health science professions qualify to take part in the CAAHEP accreditation system.  CAAHEP is also led by a Board of Directors, whose members are elected from among the Commissioners.When an education program in a health science profession seeks CAAHEP accreditation, the program will work with that profession's Committee on Accreditation (CoA).&lt;ref&gt;It is the CoA that leads the program through accreditation process, reviewing the self-study, organizing the site visit of the program, and formulating the accreditation recommendation of the program for approval by the CAAHEP Board of Directors&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief History ==

In 1904, the [[American Medical Association]] established its Council on Medical Education (CME). The CME developed a rating system of medical schools in 1905, initiated inspections in 1906, and classified the institutions in 1907. The AMA then collaborated with the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study of the quality of medical education that resulted in the [[Flexner Report]] in 1910. These early efforts subsequently led to the development of specialized accreditation for the education of health professionals. It was also the precursor of accreditation activities for most other professional associations.

Early in the 1930s, several national bodies requested the collaboration of the AMA in establishing accreditation for education programs in their areas of interest. These early efforts established a basis and pattern for the role of the AMA in collaborating with other national associations for the accreditation of health sciences education programs. From 1935 through 1976, the recognized agency was the AMA Council on Medical Education. In 1976 the CME delegated to the newly formed Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) the responsibility and authority for health sciences education accreditation. In October, 1992 the AMA announced its intent to support the establishment of a new and independent agency to assume the accreditation responsibilities of CAHEA&lt;ref&gt;That new agency, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) was incorporated in May, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs Accredited by CAAHEP==

CAAHEP accredits over 2,200 programs in 28 health science disciplines. The programs reside in more than 1,300 postsecondary educational institutions across the United States and [[Canada]].

==Accredited Professions==

;by CAAHEP the professions are:
*Advanced Cardiovascular Sonography

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3009">'''Copy number analysis''' usually refers to the process of analyzing data produced by a test for DNA [[copy number variation]] in patient's sample. Such analysis helps detect chromosomal [[copy number variation]] that may cause or may increase risks of various critical disorders.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Copy number variation can be detected with various types of tests such as [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], [[comparative genomic hybridization]] and with high-resolution array-based tests based on [[array comparative genomic hybridization]] (or aCGH), [[SNP array]] technologies and high resolution microarrays that include copy number probes as well an SNPs. Array-based methods have been accepted as the most efficient in terms of their resolution and high-throughput nature and the highest coverage (choose an array with over 2 million probes)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they are also referred to as [[virtual karyotype]]. Data analysis for an array-based DNA copy number test can be very challenging though due to very high volume of data that come out of an array platform. 

BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) arrays were historically the first [[microarray]] platform to be used for DNA [[copy number]] analysis. This platform is used to identify gross deletions or amplifications in DNA. Such anomalies for example are common in cancer and can be used for diagnosis of many developmental disorders. Data produced by such platforms are usually low to medium resolution in terms of genome coverage. Usually, log-ratio measurements are produced by this technology to represent deviation of patient's copy number state from normal. Such measurements then are studied and those that significantly differ from zero value are announced to represent a part of a chromosome with an anomaly (an abnormal copy number state). Positive log-ratios indicate a region of DNA copy number gain and negative log-ratio values mark a region of DNA copy number loss. Even a single data point can be declared an indication of a copy number gain or a copy number loss in BAC arrays.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12100">'''Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylases''', also termed '''cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 omega hydroxylases''', '''CYP450 ω-hydroxylases''', '''CYP omega hydroxylase''', '''CYP ω-hydroxylases''', '''fatty acid omega hydroxylases''', '''cytochrome P450 monooxygenases''', and '''fatty acid monooxygenases''', are a set of [[cytochrome P450]]-containing enzymes that catalyze the addition of a [[hydroxyl]] residue to a [[fatty acid]] [[Substrate (chemistry)]].  The CYP omega hydroxylases are often referred to as monoxygenases; however, the [[monooxygenase]]s are CYP450 enzymes that add a hydroxyl group to a wide range of [[xenobiotic]] (e.g. drugs, industrial toxins) and naturally occurring endobiotic (e.g. cholesterol) substrates, most of which are not fatty acids. The CYP450 omega hydroxylases are accordingly better viewed as a subset of monooxygenases that have the ability to hydroxylate fatty acids. While once regarded as functioning mainly in the [[catabolism]] of dietary fatty acids, the omega oxygenases are now considered critical in the production or break-down of fatty acid-derived mediators which are made by cells and act within their cells of origin as [[autocrine signaling]] agents or on nearby cells as [[paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate various functions such as blood pressure control and inflammation.

==Action==
The omega oxygenases metabolize fatty acids (RH) by adding a hydroxyl (OH) to their terminal (i.e. furthest from the fatty acids' carboxy residue) carbons; in the reaction, the two atoms of molecular oxygen(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ are reduced to one hydroxyl group and one water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule) by the concomitant oxidation of [[NAD(P)H]] (see [[monooxygenase]]).&lt;ref name="PUB00000123"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harayama S, Kok M, Neidle EL |title=Functional and evolutionary relationships among diverse oxygenases |journal=Annu.

&lt;center&gt;
RH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NADPH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ROH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==Functions==
CYP450 enzymes belong to a superfamily which in humans is composed of at least 57 CYPs; within this superfamily, members of six CYP4A subfamilies, (which are CYP4A, CYP4B, CYP4F, CYP4V, CYP4X, and CYP4z) possess ω-hydroxylase activity viz., CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4F&lt;ref name="Panigrahy_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panigrahy D, Kaipainen A, Greene ER, Huang S | title = Cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids: the neglected pathway in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 723–35 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 20941528 | pmc = 2962793 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9264-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15822183 | year = 2005 | author1 = Kroetz | first1 = D.

*1) The only member of the CYP4B subfamily, [[CYP4B1]], shows a preference for ω-oxidizing [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, i.e. fatty acids that are 7-9 carbons long; CYP4B1 is far more weakly expressed in humans than that expressed in other mammals that were tested.&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26233909 | pmc = 4667791 | year = 2015 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = A.

*2) A member of the CYP4A subfamily, [[CYP4A11]], preferentially ω-hydroxylate [[medium-chain fatty acids]], i.e. fatty acids that are 10-16 carbons long; [[CYP4A11]], [[CYP4F2]], [[CYP4F3]]A, [[CYP4F3]]B,  [[CYP4F11]], [[CYP4V2]], and [[CYP4Z1]] also metabolize these fatty acids.&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;  Subsequent to their ω-hydroxylation, these products are converted to their acyl[[carnitine]] derivatives and transferred to [[mitochondria]] for complete oxidized by [[beta oxidation]] (see also [[omega oxidation]]).&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*3) Members of the CYP4F family, i.e. CYPA11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F11, as well as CYP2U1 ω-hydroxylate long chain fatty acids, i.e. fatty acids that are 18 to 20 carbons long.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;  These hydroxyl fatty acids are then serially metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], and dicarboxylyl CoA synthetase to form their respective [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA)-bound dicarboxylic acids and transferred to [[peroxisome]]s where they may undergo chain shortening or, as acylcarnitine derivatives or free acids, transferred to mitochondria for complete beta oxidation. The chain-shortened products of peroxisome metabolism may also be converted to [[phospholipid]]s, [[triglycerides]], and [[cholesterol ester]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*4) Members of the CYP4F family, i.e. CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, ω-hydroxylate [[very long chain fatty acids]], i.e. fatty acids that are 22 to 26 carbons long.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt; These hydroxyl fatty acids are then serially metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]], and dicarboxylyl CoA synthetase to form their respective CoA-bound dicarboxylic acids and transferred to [[peroxisome]]s where they may undergo chain shortening or, as acylcarnitine derivatives or free acids, transferred to mitochondria for complete beta oxidation. The chain-shortened products of peroxisome metabolism may also be converted to [[phospholipid]]s, [[triglycerides]], and [[cholesterol ester]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18433732"/&gt;
*5) [[CYP4F22]] ω-hydroxylates extremely long very long chain fatty acids, i.e. fatty acids that are 28 or more carbons long. The ω-hydroxylation of these special fatty acids is critical to creating and maintaining the skins water barrier function; autosomal recessive inactivating mutations of CYP4F22 are associated with the [[Lamellar ichthyosis]] subtype of [[Congenital ichthyosiform erythrodema]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25982146 | year = 2015 | author1 = Sugiura | first1 = K | title = Update on autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis: MRNA analysis using hair samples is a powerful tool for genetic diagnosis | journal = Journal of Dermatological Science | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–9 | last2 = Akiyama | first2 = M | doi = 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2015.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*6) CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F11 ω-hydroxylate [[leukotriene B4]] and very probably [[5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]] and [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]].&lt;ref name="pmid26233909"/&gt;  This hydroxylation greatly reduces the ability of these arachidonic acid metabolites to stimulate cells that mediate [[inflammation]] and [[allergic reactions]] and may thereby limit and contribute to the resolution of these [[innate immunity]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3095426 | year = 1986 | author1 = O'Flaherty | first1 = J.

'''Demography''' (from prefix ''demo-'' from [[Ancient Greek]] δῆμος ''dēmos'' meaning "the people", and ''-graphy'' from γράφω ''graphō'', implies "writing, description or measurement"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demography for etymology (origins) of ''demography''].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[statistics|statistical study]] of [[population|populations]], especially [[human|human beings]]. As a very general science, it can analyze any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space (see [[population dynamics]]).  Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to [[birth]], [[Migration (human)|migration]], [[aging]], and [[death]]. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.

[[Demographic analysis]] can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as [[education]], [[nationality]], [[religion]], and [[ethnicity]]. Educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Population |url=http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |website=demographicpartitions.org |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814023915/http://demographicpartitions.org/science-population-determines-population-change/ |archivedate=14 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually treat demography as a field of [[sociology]], though there are a number of independent demography departments.&lt;ref name="ub"&gt;{{Cite web | title=UC Berkeley Demography department website | url=http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal demography''' limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of '''social demography''' or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hinde ''Demographic Methods'' Ch. 1 {{ISBN|0-340-71892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Demographic thoughts traced back to antiquity, and were present in many civilisations and cultures, like [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNcflpmW3BUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=studies+in+demography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y1QFr3LGxP&amp;sig=xJkW1mxVL6XS-Gij0tOpOsFZA9E&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=qdjRS8DjMsGC8gbj4Ii_Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false S.C.Srivastava,''Studies in Demography'', p.39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greece, this can be found in the writings of [[Herodotus]], [[Thucidides]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Epicurus]], [[Protagoras]], [[Polus]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006" /&gt; In Rome, writers and philosophers like [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the elder]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Epictetus]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], and [[Columella]] also expressed important ideas on this ground.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2006"/&gt;

In the [[Middle ages]], Christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the Classical ideas on demography.  Important contributors to the field were [[William of Conches]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000"&gt;Peter Biller,''The measure of multitude: Population in medieval thought''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LnqlgqeYhwYC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=Nicole+Oresme+on+demographics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RB9HPQrvY&amp;sig=RtvI_JuQ4SGR0QYfa7ptB5eDW1w&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=kdLRS8SJBcO78gbWg8jNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartholomew of Lucca]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; [[William of Pagula]],&lt;ref name="Biller2000" /&gt; and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, &amp; Daria Khaltourina (2006). ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''. Moscow: URSS,  {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was ''Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality'' (1662) by [[John Graunt]], which contains a primitive form of [[actuarial table|life table]]. Among the study's findings were that one third of the children in London died before their sixteenth birthday. Mathematicians, such as [[Edmond Halley]], developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics. [[Richard Price]] was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771,&lt;ref&gt;“Our Yesterdays: the History of the Actuarial Profession in North America, 1809-1979,” by E.J. (Jack) Moorhead, FSA, ( 1/23/10 – 2/21/04), published by the Society of Actuaries as part of the profession’s centennial celebration in 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; followed later by [[Augustus de Morgan]], ‘On the Application of Probabilities to Life Contingencies’ (1838).&lt;ref&gt;The History of Insurance, Vol 3, Edited by David Jenkins and Takau Yoneyama (1 85196 527 0): 8 Volume Set: ( 2000) Availability: Japan: Kinokuniya).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, [[Benjamin Franklin]] published his essay ''[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]'', projecting [[exponential growth]] in British colonies.&lt;ref name=valtier&gt;{{cite journal|title= "An Extravagant Assumption": The Demographic Numbers behind Benjamin Franklin's Twenty-Five-Year Doubling Period|last=von Valtier|first=William F.|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]|volume=155|number=2|date=June 2011|pages=158–188|url=http://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/5VonValtier1550205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced [[Thomas Robert Malthus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=April 25, 1941 |title=Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species' |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]] |location=Philadelphia, PA |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123 |jstor=984852 |issn=0003-049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, writing at the end of the 18th century, feared that, if unchecked, population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production, leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]). Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst]].

The period 1860-1910 can be characterised as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest. This period included a panoply of international ‘great demographers’ like [[Adolphe Quételet]] (1796–1874), [[William Farr]] (1807–1883), [[Louis-Adolphe Bertillon]] (1821–1883) and his son [[Jacques Bertillon|Jacques]] (1851–1922), [[Joseph Körösi]] (1844–1906), [[Anders Nicolas Kaier]] (1838–1919), [[Richard Böckh]] (1824–1907), [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), [[Wilhelm Lexis]] (1837–1914), and [[Luigi Bodio]] (1840–1920) contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;de Gans, Henk and Frans van Poppel (2000) Contributions from the margins.

==Methods==
There are two types of data collection—direct and indirect—with several different methods of each type.

=== Direct methods ===
Direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage, divorce, and migration (registration of place of residence). In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.

A [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.

Censuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.

[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]

=== Indirect methods ===
Indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.

There are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]]-Trussell models, [[parity progression ratios]]), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, [[Page model]]), disability ([[Sullivan's method]], [[multistate life tables]]), [[population projections]] ([[Lee–Carter model|Lee-Carter model]], the [[Leslie matrix|Leslie Matrix]]), and [[population momentum]] ([[Nathan Keyfitz|Keyfitz]]).

The United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 [[National Child Development Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Power C and Elliott J |title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34–41 |year=2006 |pmid=16155052 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[1970 British Cohort Study]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elliott J and Shepherd P|title=Cohort profile: 1970 British Birth Cohort (BCS70)|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=836–43|year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl174 |pmid=16931528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Millennium Cohort Study]], begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.&lt;ref&gt;The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common rates and ratios==

* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.
* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).
* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)
* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.
* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.
* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.
* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"&gt;Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.
* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.
* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;
* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

A stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.&lt;ref name="Ela 2008"/&gt;

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.

==Basic equation==
Suppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' persons at time ''t''.
What is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Population}_{t+1} = \text{Population}_t + \text{Natural Increase}_t + \text{Net Migration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Natural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Natural Increase}_t = \text{Births}_t - \text{Deaths}_t&lt;/math&gt;

Net migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Net Migration}_t = \text{Immigration}_t - \text{Emigration}_t&lt;/math&gt;

This basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, "net migration" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR," ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.

The figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN "medium" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803–805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.

===Science of population===
Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.  Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bongaarts]]. The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables. Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 6/7. (Jun. - Jul., 1982), pp. 179-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population.  Demographers most commonly study mortality using the [[Life Table]], a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/lftbls/lftbls.htm N C H S - Life Tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.&lt;ref&gt;Donald T. Rowland ''Demographic Methods and Concepts'' Ch. 11 {{ISBN|0-19-875263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[epidemiology]], [[geography]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]], demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the [[Cicred]] (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iussp.org International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]&lt;/ref&gt; or a national association such as the [[Population Association of America]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationassociation.org Population Association of America]&lt;/ref&gt; or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canpopsoc.org Canadian Population Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626005822/http://www.canpopsoc.org/ |date=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical codes''' are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions. An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of [[business ethics]], [[code of conduct|codes of conduct]] for employees, and codes of professional practice.

==Code of ethics or code of conduct? (corporate or business ethics)==
{{See also|Business ethics|Code of conduct}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many companies use the phrases ''ethical code'' and ''code of conduct'' interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of [[ethics]] will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.

==Code of practice (professional ethics)==
{{See also|Professional ethics}}
A code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non-governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of [[professional responsibility]], which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered "ethical" or "correct" or "right" in the circumstances.  In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, ''Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations'', the [[International Federation of Accountants]] provided the following working definition:
"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=PAIB Committee |date=31 May 2007 |title=Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations |series=International Good Practice Guidance |publisher=The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) |isbn=978-1-931949-81-1 |url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/defining-and-developing-effective-code-conduct-organizations |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

Listed below are a few example statements from the professional codes of the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) and the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] (SPJ):
; PRSA Code of Ethics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PRSA Code of Ethics |website=Public Relations Society of America |url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/ |access-date=19 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: “Loyalty: We are faithful to those we represent, while honoring our obligation to serve the public interest.”
: “Fairness: We deal fairly with clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, the media, and the general public. We respect all opinions and support the right of free expression.”
; SPJ  Code of Ethics&lt;ref name=SPJ&gt;{{cite web |date=6 September 2014 |title= SPJ Code of Ethics |website=Society of Professional Journalists |url=https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: “Minimize Harm …  Balance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness. … Balance a suspect’s right to a fair trial with the public’s right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges. …”
: “Act Independently …  Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts.”

==General notes==
Ethical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part.

They are distinct from [[moral code]]s that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2064759/Elementi_di_deontologia_politica |language=Italian |first=Giampiero |last=Buonomo |title=Elementi di deontologia politica |journal=Nuovi studi politici |date=April–September 2000 |pages=3-66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/qui/code_deontologie.asp|title=Déontologie à l'Assemblée nationale |author=Assemblée Nationale |author-link=National Assembly (France) |language=French |date=2 August 2017 |website=Assemblée Nationale|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies.

Even organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include [[Black-hat hacker|hacker communities]], bands of thieves, and [[street gang]]s.

The Jewish [[Written Torah]] and [[Oral Torah]] comprise the earliest and best preserved ethical code. Adapted to every field of actual day-to-day life for thousands of years, Jewish [[Halakha]] is the oldest collective body of [[religious law]]s, [[law]]s and [[jurisdiction]]s still in use.

Codes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is [[malum in se]], [[malum prohibitum]], and good practice.  Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational.

In sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify "good and bad behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/code%20of%20ethics |title=Code of Ethics |work=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] |access-date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flute circle''' is an organization of musicians which focuses on the [[Native American flute]].
Flute circles typically meet periodically to engage in educational and recreational
activities surrounding the instrument.
Most flute circles offer instruction on the Native American flute,
especially for flutists who are new to the instrument.
Many flute circles have a facilitator with experience in group music facilitation and
[[humanistic education|humanistic music education]]
to structure the activities and the music-making.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of the Native American flute in community music is notably different from traditional uses of the
instrument for courtship, hunting, or ceremony.&lt;ref name="Densmore1957"&gt;

 | year = 1957
 | accessdate = March 16, 2010
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This new use of the instrument has not been without controversy,
and flute circles are generally advised to use the instrument in a respectful manner because of
these considerations.&lt;ref name="Wapp1984a"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circle participants may span a wide range of experience and training in music &amp;mdash;
from professionals to novice flutists or enthusiasts
of the Native American flute.&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many flute circles focus on raising the level of [[musicality]] of the participants
across a range of levels of musical experience using basic [[Ternary form|song forms]], [[Musical improvisation|music improvisation]], and techniques of experiential [[music education]].
These techniques include [[duet]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] improvisation forms that include [[Drone (music)|drone]]s, [[ostinato]] patterns, and [[call and response]] forms.&lt;ref name="Oshinsky2008"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–25}}
Facilitation forms include ''traveling ensembles'', ''showcasing'', ''segmenting'', and general ''conducted improvisations'' &amp;mdash;
techniques that are shared with other community music structures such as
[[drum circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Hull1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While some flute circles focus on aspects of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous cultures]]
and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]],
they do not typically relate to a single culture or tribe.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circles can also organize events for participants to play at events,
festivals, school presentations,
or in service settings such as senior centers, elder facilities, and group homes.
Flute circles have also engaged in their own concerts, produced music albums,
and broadcast live music performances.&lt;ref name="ThrivingFluteCircles"&gt;

== Community music ==

Flute circles are one type of community music gathering. Other types include [[drum circle]]s, community choirs, facilitated dance, and community orchestras. However, Mary Jane Jones argues in her thesis that flute circles have particular attributes not found in other types of community music gatherings:
{{quote |text=If the goal of flute players is to express themselves through a Native American-based musical means, it could be argued that they should be able to do that just as effectively through drumming or dancing. The answer may lie with the fact that, as a wind instrument, the flute uses not just the hands, but also the breath. Singing is the ultimate form of personal musical expression. The sound is formed from within the body and the words from within the mind. For people who feel that their voices are inadequate or are hindered from singing traditional Native songs because of their inability to speak their ancestral language, using the breath to produce sound through a simple cylinder may serve as a satisfying substitute. The flute can give them a voice.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}}}

== Organizations ==

Several national organizations have formed to provide support to local flute circles:

* [http://worldflutesociety.org/ WFS] &amp;mdash; [[World Flute Society]] (U.S.A.)
* [http://flutetree.org/ FTF] &amp;mdash; FluteTree Foundation (U.S.A.) (formerly RNAFF, Renaissance of the North American Flute Foundation)
* [http://jifca.com/ JIFCA] &amp;mdash; Japan Indian Flute Circle Association (日本インディアンフルートサークル協会) (Japan)

A roster of registered flute circles is maintained by WFS&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster" /&gt;
and FTF.&lt;ref name="RNAFF_Roster"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.rnaff.org/flute-circles-directory.html
 |title=Flute Circles Directory

 |author=FluteTree Foundation
 |year=2016
 |accessdate=2016-02-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===

As of March 13, 2016, the roster of flute circles in this article listed 189 organizations in 9 countries, including flute circles in 44 States of the United States and 5 Provinces of Canada.

==== Historical ====
The chart below depicts the historical number of flute circles registered with the WFS (shown in darker blue) and its predecessor organization, the International Native American Flute Association ("INAFA") (shown in lighter blue).

The data for years prior to 2016 were gathered on March 13, 2016 from historical WFS and INAFA web pages provided by the [[Wayback Machine]].
The data for 2016 and 2017 were gathered from the live WFS web site on March 4, 2016 and January 3, 2017, respectively.

The data point for each year was taken on the first date in the year that the respective web site was updated. Data for the years 2012&amp;ndash;2014 represents the shift in organizations from INAFA to WFS.
The data roughly agrees with the Jones thesis, which reported 115 flute circles on the INAFA roster in 2010.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Image:Gantry2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[University of Virginia]] spherical gantry, an example of a modern image-based gonioreflectometer]]
A '''gonioreflectometer''' is a device for measuring a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF).

The device consists of a light source illuminating the material to be measured and a [[sensor]] that captures light reflected from that material. The light source should be able to [[lighting|illuminate]] and the sensor should be able to capture data from a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] around the target. The hemispherical rotation [[dimension]]s of the sensor and light source are the four dimensions of the BRDF. The 'gonio' part of the word refers to the device's ability to measure at different angles.

Several similar devices have been built and used to capture data for similar functions. Most of these devices use a [[camera]] instead of the light intensity-measuring sensor to capture a two-dimensional sample of the target. Examples include:
*a spatial gonioreflectometer for capturing the [[SBRDF]]{{What|date=April 2011}} (McAllister,2002).
*a camera gantry for capturing the [[light field]] (Levoy and Hanrahan, 1996).
*an unnamed device for capturing the [[bidirectional texture function]] (Dana, et al. 1999).

[[File:Sewer overflow RI EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Excessive infiltration/inflow may cause sanitary sewer overflows during wet weather.]]'''Infiltration/Inflow''' ('''I/I''') causes dilution in [[sanitary sewer]]s.  Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity.  Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers.  The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines the term infiltration/inflow as combined contributions from both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=e59aece1945f2c220e3474257ee2a251&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:1.0.1.2.32&amp;idno=40#40:1.0.1.2.32.4.142.4 40CFR35.905] Accessed 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Early [[combined sewer]]s used [[surface runoff]] to dilute waste from [[toilet]]s and carry it away from urban areas into natural waterways.  [[Sewage treatment]] can remove some [[pollutant]]s from toilet waste, but treatment of diluted flow from combined sewers produces larger volumes of treated sewage with similar pollutant concentrations.  Modern sanitary sewers are designed to transport domestic and industrial [[wastewater]] directly to treatment facilities without dilution.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. ''Water Supply and Sewerage'' (1979) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infiltration==
[[Groundwater]] entering sanitary sewers through defective pipe joints and broken pipes is called ''infiltration''.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, James J. ''The Environmental Dictionary'' (1995) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-11995-4}} p.335&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipes may leak because of careless installation; they may also be damaged after installation by differential ground movement, heavy vehicle traffic on roadways above the sewer, careless construction practices in nearby trenches, or degradation of the sewer pipe materials.  In general, volume of leakage will increase over time. Damaged and broken sewer cleanouts are a major cause of infiltration into municipal sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/region1/sso/pdfs/PrivateSewerLaterals.pdf EPA Report June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Infiltration will occur where local groundwater elevation is higher than the sewer pipe.  Gravel bedding materials in sewer pipe trenches act as a [[French drain]].  Groundwater flows parallel to the sewer until it reaches the area of damaged pipe.  In areas of low groundwater, sewage may exfiltrate into groundwater from a leaking sewer.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy ''Wastewater Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill pp.39-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflow==
Water entering sanitary sewers from inappropriate connections is called ''inflow''.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;  Typical sources include sump pumps, roof drains, cellar drains, and yard drains where urban features prevent surface runoff, and storm drains are not conveniently accessible or identifiable.  Inflow tends to peak during precipitation events, and causes greater flow variation than infiltration. Peak flows caused by inflow may generate a [[foul flush]] of accumulated [[biofilm]] and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather [[wetted perimeter]] of oversized sewers during peak flow [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/rrr/wiki-internal/files/sediment%20control.pdf |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |website=[[University of California Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of inflow can sometimes be identified by [[smoke testing (mechanical)|smoke testing]].  Smoke is blown into the sewer during dry weather while observers watch for smoke emerging from yards, cellars, or roof gutters.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;Hammer, Mark J. ''Water and Waste-Water Technology'' (1975) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} pp.303-304&amp;441-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Dilution of sewage directly increases costs of pumping and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozonation, or [[ultraviolet disinfection]].  Physical treatment structures including screens and pumps must be enlarged to handle the peak flow.  Primary clarifiers must also be enlarged to treat average flows, although [[primary treatment]] of peak flows may be accomplished in [[detention basin]]s.  Biological [[secondary treatment]] is effective only while the concentration of soluble and colloidal pollutants (typically measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] or BOD) remains high enough to sustain a population of microorganisms digesting those pollutants.  Secondary treatment is expected to remove 85 percent of soluble and colloidal organic pollutants from sewage containing 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L BOD;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt; but BOD removal by conventional biological secondary treatment becomes less effective with dilution and practically ceases as BOD concentrations entering the treatment facility are diluted below about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  Unremoved organics are potentially converted to [[disinfection by-products]] by chemical disinfection prior to discharge.

High rates of infiltration/inflow may make the sanitary sewer incapable of carrying sewage from the design service area.  Sewage may back up into the lowest homes during wet weather, or street manholes may overflow.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

==Correction==
Smoke test results may not correlate well with flow volumes; although they can identify potential problem locations.  Where sewage flow is expected to be relatively uniform, significance of infiltration and inflow may be estimated by comparison of sewage flow at the same point during wet and dry weather or at two sequential points within the sewer system.  Small areas with large flow differences can be identified if the sewer system provides adequate measuring locations.  It may be necessary to replace a section of sewer line if flow differences cannot be corrected by removing identified connections.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6891">[[File:Mechanism of Invagination .png|thumb|Mechanism of Invagination|300x300px]]
In [[developmental biology]], '''invagination''' is a mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. This mechanism or cell movement happens mostly in the [[vegetal pole]]. Invagination consists of the folding of an area of the exterior sheet of cells towards the inside of the [[blastula]]. In each organism, the complexity will be different depending on the number of cells. Invagination can be referenced as one of the steps of the establishment of the body plan.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Rauno |first2=Anne |date=1997 |title=Embryology, Constructing the Organism |format=book |language=english |location=Sunderland, MA. |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=0-87893-237-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott |last2=Barresi |first2=Michael |date=2016 |title=Developmental Biology |format=book |language=English |location=Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc. |isbn=9781605354705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, originally used in [[embryology]], has been adopted in other disciplines as well. 
There is more than one type of movement for invagination. Two common types are axial and orthogonal. The difference between the production of the tube formed in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Axial can be formed at a single point along the axis of a surface. Orthogonal is linear and trough.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie A. Davies, In Mechanisms of Morphogensis (Second Edition), 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
* Invagination is the [[morphogenetic]] processes by which an [[embryo]] takes form, and is the initial step of [[gastrulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the massive reorganization of the embryo from a simple spherical ball of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], the [[blastula]], into a multi-layered [[organism]], with differentiated [[germ layer]]s: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.  More localized invaginations also occur later in embryonic development,
* The inner membrane of a [[mitochondrion]] '''invaginates''' to form [[crista]]e, thus providing a much greater surface area to accommodate the protein complexes and other participants that produce [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cronk|first=Jeff|title=Biochemistry Dictionary|url=http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114235521/http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/faculty/cronk/biochem/M-index.cfm?definition=mitochondria|archivedate=2012-11-14|df=}}[dead link]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Invagination occurs during [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] when a vesicle forms within the cell and the membrane closes around it.
* Invagination of a part of the [[intestine]] into another part is called [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanco|first=Felix|title=Intussusception|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/930708-overview|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphioxus===
[[File:Invagination.jpg|thumb|Invagination process in Amphioxus]]
The invagination in ''Amphioxus'' is the first cell movement of [[gastrulation]]. This process was first described by Conklin. During [[gastrulation]], the [[blastula]] will be transformed by the invagination. The [[endoderm]] will fold towards the inner part and that way the [[blastocoel]] will be gone transforming into like a cup-shaped structure with a double wall. The inner wall will be called the [[archenteron]]; the primitive gut. The [[archenteron]] will open to the exterior through the [[blastopore]]. The outer wall will become the [[ectoderm]]. Later forming the [[epidermis]] and [[neural crest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browder |first=Leon |date=1984 |title=Developmental Biology |location=Canada |publisher=CBS College Publishing |page=599 |isbn= 4833702010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunicates===
In tunicates, invagination is the first mechanism that takes place during [[gastrulation]]. The four largest [[endoderm]] cells induce the invagination process in the [[tunicates]]. Invagination consists of the internal movements of a sheet of cells (the [[endoderm]]) based on changes in their shape. The [[blastula]] of the tunicates is a little flattened in the [[vegetal pole]] making a change of shape from a columnar to a wedge shape. Once the [[endoderm]] cells were invaginated, the cells will keep moving beneath the [[ectoderm]]. Later, the [[blastopore]] will be formed and with this, the invagination process is complete. The [[blastopore]] will be surrounded by the [[mesoderm]] by all sides.&lt;ref name="Sinauer Associates Inc"/&gt;

==Philosophy&lt;!-- 'Invagination (philosophy)' redirects here --&gt;==
In [[Continental philosophy]], the term '''invagination'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is used to explain a special kind of [[metanarrative]]. It was first used by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=The Visible and the Invisible|year=1968|publisher=Northwestern University Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0810104571|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|invagination}}) to describe the dynamic self-differentiation of the 'flesh'. It was later used by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] ("The Law of Genre", ''Glyph 7'', 1980); for Derrida, an invaginated text is a narrative that folds upon itself, "endlessly swapping outside for inside and thereby producing a structure ''[[Mise en abyme|en abyme]]''".&lt;ref name=chaplin&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaplin|first=Susan|title=Law, Sensibility, and the Sublime in Eighteenth-Century Women's Fiction: Speaking of Dread|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOqNqq4i2ioC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754633068|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applies the term to such texts as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''&lt;ref name=chaplin/&gt; and [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s ''La Folie du Jour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5zCts8ax58C&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415267069|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invagination is an aspect of [[différance]], since according to Derrida it opens the "inside" to the "other" and denies both inside and outside a stable identity.&lt;ref name=wortham&gt;{{cite book|last=Wortham|first=Simon Morgan|title=The Derrida Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVtjXOyPSMAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=12 January 2013|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International|isbn=9781847065261|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal education''' is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of [[law]]. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for [[Admission to practice law|admission to legal practice]] in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary [[Law degree|degrees in law]], which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as [[Master of Laws|masters]] and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* [[Continuing legal education]], which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of [[rhetoric]]. Around the third century BC [[Tiberius Coruncanius]] began teaching law as a separate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;George Long article, p. 655 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anqiquities'' by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (''jurisprudentes''), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. "legal education." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007  &lt;http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9106475&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oo-U8MDJVJAJ:www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteen century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Boon and Julian Webb, '[http://letr.org.uk/references/storage/U7RC3RR2/Boon%20%26%20Webb,%20back%20to%20the%20future.pdf Legal Education and Training in England and Wales: Back to the Future?]' (2008) 58(1) ''Journal of Legal Education'' 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of legal education ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===
[[File:Uppsala Gustavianum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gustavianum]]'', The Swedish [[Uppsala University]] built 1622–1625 and now a museum, was one of the pioneers in formal legal education]]
In many countries, including most of those in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the principal law degree is an [[undergraduate degree]], usually known as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country's equivalent of a [[bar exam]]. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the [[Law school in the United States|United States]], the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a [[bachelor's degree]]. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor's degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by [[law school]]s, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SSRN 3021333].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Law Society, [https://www.lawsociety.com.au/about/StudentHub/BecomingAdmitted/PLT/index.htm#1 'Practical Legal Training'], retrieved 8 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a [[barrister]] or as a [[solicitor]] are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
[[Continuing legal education]] (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

===Australia===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Australia}}

In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. [[Bond University]] in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2{{fraction|2|3}} years. They also offer a JD in two years. The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111235355/http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[University of Melbourne]] introduced the [[Melbourne Model]], whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible.&lt;ref name="law.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php|publisher=Law.harvard.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for [[graduate entry|graduate-entry]] into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Australian Catholic University]], [[Australian National University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Bond University]], [[Macquarie Law School|Macquarie]], [[Monash University Faculty of Law|Monash]], [[Deakin University School of Law|Deakin]], [[UNSW Faculty of Law|UNSW]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[Adelaide Law School|Adelaide]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], [[Sydney Law School|Sydney]], [[Melbourne University Law School|Melbourne]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], the [[TC Beirne School of Law|University of Queensland]], the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Canberra]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Canada}}

The professional law degree in Canada is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), for [[common law]] jurisdictions, and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law]] for Quebec, a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction. Admittance to an LL.B. or J.D. program requires at least two years of [[undergraduate]] education, although, a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree|(bachelor's) degree]]. The change in academic [[nomenclature]] redesignating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—because it is the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2007/11/13/to-jd-or-not-to-jd/ To JD or Not JD — Law is Cool], November 13, 2007.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Legal education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the [[Common Professional Examination]] conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) currently offered at the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU), [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and [[City University of Hong Kong]], before starting vocational training: a year's [[pupillage]] for [[barrister]]s or a two-year [[training contract]] for [[solicitor]]s.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===
{{Main article|Legal education in India}}
{{See also|Autonomous law schools in India|Common Law Admission Test|List of law schools in India}}

The [[Bar Council of India]] prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961], which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of [[Bachelor's degree]]. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the "licenza in diritto". There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies ([[Bologna process]]):
* first a license of law program (''Licence de droit''): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (''Master de droit''): two-year period
* Ph.D. in Law (''Doctorat en droit''): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized : public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in Law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student's grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the [[University of Tokyo]] Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically-dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|title=Legal Education and the Reproduction of the Elite in Japan, 1 Asian-Pac. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 2|year=1999|publisher=Hawaii.edu|author=Setsuo Miyazawa|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081700/http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the implementation of the "law school system" in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized "cram schools" trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]]. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, [[legal research]]. During this period, the most "capable trainees" are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school {{nihongo|law schools|法科大学院|hōka daigakuin}} that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from "elite" Japanese universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]] or [[Hitotsubashi University]]. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (''[[benrishi]]''), tax accountants (''[[zeirishi]]''), [[scrivener]]s, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys ("bengoshi"), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
{{Main article|Law school in Korea}}

Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized "private educational institutes" exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the [[Judicial Research and Training Institute]] of the [[Supreme Court of Korea]]. During this period, the most capable trainees are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (''법학전문대학원''). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government's approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (''변리사''), tax attorneys (''세무사''), [[solicitor]]s(''법무사''), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|Legal education in Malaysia}}
As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Malaysian Higher School Certificate]], [[A-Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]], Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]] that include [[Sharia]] or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/programmes-courses/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-law-llb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuha.unisza.edu.my/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072652/http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the Philippines}}
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the LEGAL EDUCATION BOARD, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals.  Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino.  Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education.  The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University.  The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law.  Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
[[Law degree]] – jurist (often compared to an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and [[Ukraine]] after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor's or master's degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor's – master's) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the [[Bologna accords]]. See also [[academic degree]]. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor's degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master's degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master's degree.

=== Serbia ===
{{See also|History of legal education in Serbia|University of Belgrade Faculty of Law}}

To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. Studies last for five years (ten semesters) in accordance to the [[Bologna process|Bologna Convention]]. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. Students are divided into full-time students and part-time students. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international [[moot court]] competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a [[prosecutor]].

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practice as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or [[magistrate]] in the [[South African Law#Court System in South Africa|lower courts]], but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practice as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Law_DoL_Report.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For admission as an attorney, one serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for two years, and then writes a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. See [[Attorneys in South Africa]]. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]].

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination.

=== South American countries ===
{{Main article|Law in South America}}
The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

=== Sri Lanka ===
{{main|Legal education in Sri Lanka}}
In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be 'admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]]. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an [[LL.B.]] (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Jaffna]], [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] and [[University of Peradeniya]]) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don't hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a [[Graduate Diploma in Law]] where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a [[barrister]], [[legal executive]], or [[solicitor]].

{{See also|Law School Admission Council}}

The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a [[law school]] program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt; http://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readerrules.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state's bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States,in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), a [[Doctoral]] degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a [[bachelor's degree]]). The law school program is considered to be a [[professional school]] program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves "doctor").

Research degrees that are awarded include the [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional [[Law clerk#United States|judicial clerkship]] (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, he or she is expected to pursue [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the [[bar association|bar]] vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22856">A '''literature circle''' is equivalent of an adult [[Book discussion club|book club]], but with greater structure, expectation and rigor. The aim is to encourage thoughtful discussion and a love of reading in young people.  The true intent of literature circles is "to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers" (DaLie, 2001).

==Background of literature circles==
Literature circles were first implemented in 1982 by Karen Smith, an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona.  Handed a box of odd-and-end novels by a fellow teacher, Karen took them and promptly forgot about them.  Later that year, some of her fifth grade students expressed an interest in reading them, organized themselves loosely into groups, and started to discuss the novels.  Smith was surprised at the degree of their engagement with the books and the complexity of their discussions, they had no outside help or instruction from their teacher (Daniels, 1994). From here literature circles evolved into reading, study and discussion groups based around different groupings of students reading a variety of different novels.  They differ from traditional English instruction where students in classroom all read one “core” novel, often looking to the teacher for the answers and the meaning and literary analysis of the text.  They highlight discussion, student response, free choice, and collaboration, "providing a way for students to engage in critical thinking and reflection" ([http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center] Schlick Noe, 2004).  Well-run literature circles highlight student choice; occur over an extended period of time as part of a [[Balanced Literacy]] program; involve numerous structured and unstructured opportunities for student response and interpretation; and incorporate assessment and evaluation that includes self-assessment and numerous extension projects.  Research on literature circles is conducted primarily by [[Harvey Daniels]] (1994, 2002, 2004), [[Katherine L. Schlick Noe]] (1995, 1999, 2001, 2003), Bonnie Campbell Hill (1995, 2001, 2003), and Nancy J. Johnson (1995, 1999, 2001);  they are credited with most of the research and teacher resources around this approach to student choice and reading; however, numerous other researchers, including Kathy Short and Kathryn Mitchell Pierce (1990), Jerome Harste, Kathy Short and Carolyn Burke (1988), Katherine Samway (1991), Suzi Keegan and Karen Shrake (1991)  have conducted research and classroom-based studies.  This approach to reading and learning looks to some of the best practices and theory from [[collaborative learning]] and [[scaffolding theory]].  [[Reader-response criticism]], [[independent reading]], and [[student-centered learning]]  comprise most of the theoretical underpinning of literature circles.

Literature circles combine the best practices of collaborative learning and student-directed learning.  They are not to be confused with [[book discussion club]]s, currently popular in some circles.  While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] (including [[self-assessment]], observations and conferences) and [[evaluation]] ([[Career portfolio|portfolios]], projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. Literature circles are a pedagogically sound alternative to teacher-centered discourse.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  They can be used at all grade and ability levels, and are often credited{{who|date=April 2014}} with instilling a love of reading and discussion in students.  Furthermore, current research indicates that peer collaboration has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall ''et al''., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).

==Key features of literature circles==
#Children choose their own reading materials.
#Small temporary groups are formed, based on book choice.
#Different groups read different books
#Groups meet on a regular predictable schedule.
#Students use written or drawn notes to guide both their reading and discussion.
#Discussion topics come from the students
#Group meetings aim to be open, natural conversations.  Often the conversations digress to topics relating to the students or loosely to the books, but should eventually return to the novel.
#The teacher serves as a facilitator, observer, listener and often a fellow reader, alongside the students.  The teacher is not an instructor.
#Students are given roles or jobs to complete for each group meeting.
#The teacher should model how students should facilitate each role or job.
#Evaluation is by teacher observation and student self-evaluation and should also include extension projects.
#A spirit of playfulness and fun pervades the room.
#New groups form around new reading choices.
(Daniels, 1994)

Discussion prompts can be given by the teacher to encourage a direction for the students' responses, such as "How does the setting affect the characters?"  "What are alternative solutions to the character's conflicts in the text?" "What connections can you make with regard to the character's situation(s)?"

==Implementation considerations==
Students begin literature circles by participating in mini-lessons on how to participate in a discussion group. To begin with they may be given role sheets to assist them in taking notes on their reading and preparing for the discussion.

Sticky notes (e.g. PostIt notes) are often distributed by teachers to assist students in recording their thoughts about text elements, as they make access easy to various pages in the book.  Clip boards may assist children in using their role sheets when groups use floor space to conduct their discussions. 

As group discussions evolve and improve, ideally the role sheets should eventually be used only for redirecting the discussion when students get off-track.  In fact, Daniels notes that "the goal of role sheets is to make the role sheets obsolete" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  What he means by this is that role sheets help students stay on task and focus their discussions.  As students become more comfortable in their groups and learn the level of discourse and response that is expected of them, ideally they will no longer need the role sheets at all: "In many classrooms, the role sheets are abandoned as soon as groups are capable of lively, text-centered, multifaceted discussions" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  Schlick Noe and Johnson note that role sheets take focus and energy away from group discussions:  "Students can learn collaborative and individual accountability strategies to make their discussions work without the constraints of role sheets" (Schlick Noe and Johnson, 1999, cited from [http://www.litcircles.org/Discussion/discussion.html Literature Circles Resource Center)] Most teachers starting out may, however, wish to assign roles to students to help them learn some of the structures of Literature Circles and to aid in classroom management.

==Roles in literature circles==
The following is a list of roles which give a thinking task to each group member.  Students divide the tasks among themselves in each group.  As the groups reconvene each session, students switch roles, so that by the end of the literature circles "unit," each student will have the opportunity to participate in each role.  Again, the ideal is to eventually do away with the roles, although many teachers opt to continue using the roles to assist group on-task behaviour.  One thing to keep in mind:  Readers who are deeply engaged with a book and eager to talk about it with others may not need the structure of roles.  Many teachers discover that the roles feel restrictive to some students and can become a disincentive to take part in literature circles.  Harvey Daniels always intended roles to be a temporary scaffold to support students as they learn to talk about books in small groups.

===Discussion facilitator===
This role involves developing a list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting.  Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be [[open questions]].   A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task.  Questions that a student might ask could be:  "What was going through your mind when you read this passage?" or "How did the main character change as a result of this incident?"{{sfrac|
|}}{{frac|{{frac|{{mvar|{{math|}}}}|}}|}}

===Commentator===

This role involves locating a few significant passages of text that are thought-provoking, funny, interesting, disturbing, or powerful.  The quotations are copied down with properly cited page numbers.  A student with this task can read the passages out loud him/herself or ask other group members to read as well.  Commentary and discussion will be generated from these passages.
and also draw a part of the scene that locates where the person took place

===Illustrator===

As the term implies, this job entails drawing, sketching, or painting a picture, portrait or scene relating to the appropriate section of the novel.  Collages from magazines, images from the internet, and other media can also be used.  The student with this role then shares the artwork with the group, explaining the passage(s) that relate to the art.  Often students who do not like to write do very well with this role.  The pictures usually generate interesting group conversations.

===Connector or Reflector===

This role involves locating several significant passages in the novel and connecting these passages to real life.  The connections might relate to school, friends or family, home, the community, or they might relate to movies, celebrities, the media etc.  Students should also feel free to connect incidents or characters with other books that they have read.  Of all the roles, this role is often the most personal in its focus.

===Summarizer===

This role involves preparing a brief summary of the reading that was assigned for that day's meeting.  The summary should include the main ideas or events to remember, major characters, symbols or other significant highlights of the passage.  Good summarizers are important to literature circles, as they can help their peers see the overall picture (DaLie, 2001). Also include important events and details.

===Vocabulary Enricher===

Also called the Word Master or Word Wizard, this role is to record important words for that day's reading.  Words that are unusual, unknown, or that stand out in some way are usually chosen by the student.  Their page number and definition is also recorded.  Often students do not see this role as particularly stimulating; however, it can be a role suited to students who are still developing confidence in English classes or textual analysis.

===Travel Tracer===

This role involves recording where the major shifts in action or location take place in the novel for the reading section.  Keeping track of shifts in place, time, and characters helps students keep track of important shifts in the novel.  Artistic students also are drawn to this role, as artwork can be incorporated into this role as well.  The student's role is to describe each setting in detail, using words or maps that illustrate the action.

===Investigator===

This role includes investigative work where background information needs to be found on any topic relating to the book.  Historical, geographical, cultural, musical or other information that would help readers connect to the novel is often researched and shared with the group.  The research is informal in nature, providing small bits of information in order that others can better understand the novel.

===Figurative Language Finder===

This role includes identification of various types of figurative language, including but not limited to simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom.  This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, and whether or not they were effective.  This in-context identification can be more relevant and memorable than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools.

==Assessment and evaluation of literature circles==
Most teachers assess and evaluate what students do in Literature Circles. This may involve one or several of the following assessment(s) and evaluation(s):
*'''[[Self-Assessment]]'''
**Students should be involved in monitoring and recording their own level of response and engagement with their book and participation with their group as they meet each session. Often formal checklists are used for students to keep track of their progress.
*'''[[Peer group|Peer Assessment]]'''
**Students can also be empowered to assess their fellow group members over the course of their book talks.  As with self-assessment, checklists or other rubrics can provide structure.
*'''Observations'''
**On-going teacher observation and active participation in group discussions is critical in assessing student progress both individually and in whole group.  Daniels (1994) notes that most assessment should be formative, ensuring that students are provided with timely feedback to learn more effectively.  Observations can meet such formative assessment criteria.
*'''Conferences'''
**Face-to-face conversations between student and teacher can help to "access, track and monitor student growth" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;160).
*'''[[Career portfolio|Portfolios]]'''
**Collections of student products, collected and assembled in a meaningful fashion, provide the opportunity for reflection, discussion, response to the book, and displaying a student's best work.  Portfolios can take on many forms, ranging from writing, art, video/audiotapes, learning logs, student journals, personal responses etc. (Daniels, 1994).
*'''Extension Projects'''
**Extension Projects can take the form of numerous creative and artistic student products, from book jackets to visual media or printed forms.  Projects provide readers with "additional ways to revisit what they've read, continue the conversations (and the discoveries), and create even more meaning" (Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, [http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center)].  More conversations about the books usually arise out of sharing of these projects with the group and the whole class.
*'''Student Artifacts'''
**Response logs, role sheets, and other process material that students have compiled over the course of the Literature Circle meetings can be also evaluated providing "a rich source of insight" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;164) for the teacher to assess growth and progress of students.
*'''Wikis and Blogs'''
**Students may blog on a teacher created website.  This blog will not only facilitate conversation, but implement technology.  The blog will also give teachers a means by which to grade and assess the quality of student comprehension. Blogs enable students to share ideas, read class notes, and give feedback to the class.

A '''model spectrum''' is an artificial [[spectrum]] of a [[star]] made by recreating the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] features seen in the spectrum. A model spectrum will usually be of a specific [[spectral type]] of [[star]]. It may include other properties of the star, such as a surrounding [[nebula]], presence or lack of an extended [[atmosphere]], or a [[circumstellar dust]] [[accretion disk|disc]].

'''Nankai Institute of Economics''' (Chinese: 南开大学经济研究所, abbreviated NKIE), founded in 1927 by [[何廉|He Lian]] and [[Zhang Boling]], was originally named Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics. It changed its name into Nankai Institute of Economics in 1931, and then established the tenet of the institute, which is to "know China and serve China". The systematic social research that the institute has conducted was ahead of its time in China. The [[Nankai Price Index]], compiled in 1927, was the very first price index in China and the most important reference to the study of Chinese economy during that time, indicating that it was rather influential and of high academic value.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=易仲芳|date=1 March 2013|title=南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究（1927-1949年）|journal=华中师范大学}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was then regarded as the authority of Chinese economic studies during the period of Republic of China (1912–1949).&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录"&gt;{{Cite book|title=何廉回忆录|last=何廉|publisher=中国文史出版社|editor-last=朱佑慈等译|location=北京}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nankai Institute of Economics is now affiliated to the School of Economics, and located at the Balitai campus of [[Nankai University]], [[Nankai District]], [[Tianjin]].

=== Early stage ===
In 1926, He Lian returned to China after receiving his doctor's degree from [[Yale University]], and was offered a position by Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai University, and [[Tao Menghe]], the head of the social research's department of [[China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture]]. Tao Menghe invited He Lian to be the research adviser for the department. Although he declined the offer, He Lian was still interested in the idea and proposed to Zhang Boling that an independent research organization should be established, which was approved by Zhang Boling.&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt;

On September 10, 1927, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was founded under the support of Zhang Boling and He Lian, and it was the previous form of Nankai Institute of Economics. Its office was set in [[Xiushan Hall]], [[Balitai]]. He Lian took the position of chief adviser of the committee. Because it was considered a specialized research institution, the committee focused its early studies on two aspects, the collection of books, journals and other materials about Chinese economy, written in Chinese and other languages, as well as the compilation of an anthology of Chinese economics which included editing and analyzing the statistics of Chinese economy. In 1928, [[Fang Xianting]], a fellow student of He Lian's, returned to China to support Nankai University after receiving his doctorate of economics from Yale. He was officially employed as the chief researcher of the committee. Influence by Fang Xianting, the committee shifted its focus to the study of "the degree and the impact of China's industrialization" in the Tianjin region, which is China's first systematic research on social economics and earliest empirical research of economics.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nankai.edu.cn/nkyw/system/2012/09/10/000085694.shtml|title=南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年|author1=陈鑫|date=10 September 2012|agency=南开大学新闻网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
[[File:南开大学经济研究所第一届研究生毕业纪念.jpg|thumb|The first graduate graduation commemorative photo in 1937]]
In 1931, Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics, together with Economic Studies under the [[School of Arts]]{{dn|date=April 2018}},&lt;!--Doesn't look like an art school--&gt;, formed the School of Economics, and the committee started to take on the role of an educational facility as well. From 1931 onwards, Nankai Institute of Economics made progress with impressive research results and its research conditions improved because of it. In the spring of 1934, the department of education of the nationalist government refused to register the School of Economics as an official institution and demanded its reorganization because the name of the school violated the regulations about "organizing university". Nankai University, therefore, had to withdraw the use of the name "School of Economics" in its official documents, and reuse the "Business School". The Economic Studies, which was previously subordinate to the School of Arts, was affiliated to the Business School. Meanwhile, because of other regulations on the establishment of institutes, the university set up "the Economic Department of Business School Institute", i.e., "Nankai Institute of Economics" (abbreviated NKIE).&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=5 March 1997|title=南开经济研究所(中国·南开大学)简史|journal=经济研究|issue=1997(03)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nankai did not follow up on the regulations of the government's department of education. Although it kept the accepted names in its official reports to the government, the university remained using the "School of Economics" and "Nankai Institute of Economics" in other occasions. The journal ''Nankai Index'' was created in the same year, and it received much attention from the academia in China and in other countries, because the journal was a reflection of Chinese economy at that period. In July 1935, NKIE started to accept postgraduate students, which were the first ones educated in China to receive master's degree of economics that were officially admitted by the department of education.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt; In 1935, six institutions, including NKIE, [[Peking Union Medical College]], [[Yenching University]], [[Tsinghua University]], [[University of Nanking]], and [[China's Association for Mass Education]], jointly established the "[[Association of Northern China's Countrysides Establishment]]", which was funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He Lian was appointed as the chairman of the association and Fang Xianting the secretary.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt; NKIE was then responsible for the training of people who could manage local governments, their financial problems and other cooperation organizations.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt;

=== During the second Sino-Japanese war ===
[[File:被炸后的南开大学秀山堂残迹.jpg|thumb|The remains of NKIE's office after Xiushan Hall was bombed]]
In 1936, before the war started, Zhang Boling took precautionary measures in case that Nankai University was assaulted by the Japanese army. Before the army took over Tianjin, Nankai Institute of Economics was relocated to the underground floor of Zhongshu Library in Chongqing Nankai Secondary School, and 21,000 books and research materials, which had been collected for the last dozen years, were put into 127 boxes and shipped towards south before the university was bombed. After years of transportation through [[Hong Kong]], [[Haiphong]] and several other places, the boxes eventually arrived in Chongqing in 1940.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt;[[File:Office_Building_of_Nankai.JPG|thumb|During the war, NKIE moved south and relocated in [[Chongqing Nankai Secondary School]]]]On July 29th, 1937, Nankai University was bombed by the Japanese army. The office of NKIE at Xiushan Hall was destroyed, but none of the faculty members were injured or dead. Since Nankai University and other universities coalesced and formed [[National Southwestern Associated University]], NKIE then changed its name into Economic Studies under the Business School Institute of National Southwestern Associated University. By 1939, the institute had been reestablished at the library of [[Chongqing Nankai Secondary School]], and it had also set up an agency in Kunming (where the Associated University was located).&lt;ref name="南开大学校史1989年版"&gt;{{Cite book|title=南开大学校史|last=南开大学校史编写组|date=October 1989|publisher=南开大学出版社|location=天津}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Chinese civil war ===
In April 1946, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] signed the proposal to transform Nankai University from a private school into a national public university.&lt;ref name="蒋介石与张伯苓及南开大学"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=江沛|date=2011|title=蒋介石与张伯苓及南开大学|journal=民国档案|issue=01|pages=69-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4th, National Southwestern Associated University held its annual graduation ceremony. It then announced the disintegration of the university on July 31st, and Nankai University moved back to Tianjin and resumed its operation. In December, NKIE returned to Tianjin, but many funds that it previously received from abroad such as [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and Institute of the Pacific Relations had stopped because of its status as a public university. The researches were therefore influenced due to the lack of financial support.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt;

In September 1947, after leaving the Kuomingtang government, He Lian and Fang Xianting established an independent "[[Chinese Economic Research Institute]]" in Shanghai on the support of [[Zhou Zuomin]] and [[Dai Zimu]], the chairman and the associate manager of [[Kincheng Banking Corporation]], in order to retain the personnel of NKIE. This institute acted as a branch of NKIE, with Fang Xianting as its director, while the members were mostly previous employees at NKIE and other graduate students of NKIE.&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt;

=== From 1949 onwards ===
After 1949, since [[Marxian economics]] gained traction in mainland China, He Lian, Fang Xianting and other founders moved abroad one after another. Because it used to receive funds from foreign organizations like Rockefeller Foundation, Nankai Institute of Economics became a target of political oppression. It was demanded to be reformed, while many faculty members received unfair treatment.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所“学术中国化”研究" /&gt; In 1952, after the reformation of higher education institutions, NKIE once stopped operating.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt; In 1958, Hebei's Institute of Economics of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] was established on the basis of the old NKIE, but it was still located inside the campus of Nankai University. The independent Hebei's Institute of Economics kept its academic communication with the School of Economics of Nankai University, and many academic conferences were held among these institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=27 December 1959|title=南开大学经济系与中国科学院河北分院经济研究所联合举行科学讨论会|journal=经济研究|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1959, the prime minister [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Nankai University, and he was in support of the operation of NKIE. He asked, "why won't He Lian return to China? He has every right to come back." Besides this, Zhou Enlai also asked people to send his regards to He Lian and invite him to return when he met with guests from abroad.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=李家斌|date=15 April 1981|title=钱荣堃教授谈南开大学经济研究所|journal=人民教育}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Hebei's Institute of Economics was to be shut down, and Zhou Enlai instructed Nankai University to take over it and change its name back to Nankai Institute of Economics, with the director of the School of Economics Ji Taoda as its director, and both the dean of the School of Economics [[Teng Weizao]] and the associate director [[Tao Jikan]] as its associate directors. The institute then set up four research branches, i.e. Socialist Economy, U.S. Economy, Oceania Economy and History of Modern China's Economy.&lt;ref name="南开经济研究所简史" /&gt;

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the research at NKIE was often put into halts, and the research branches did not resume their works until 1973. In December 1979, ''Political Economics: Socialist Part'', edited by the director of NKIE [[Gu Shutang]], was officially published and became the widely-used textbook of economics among the universities in the northern China, so it was called the "northern edition". This book broke the frame of a typical Soviet Union's textbook, absorbed the newest research results and went through several revisions. It was then considered an influential volume by the educational sphere of economics in China.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=中国特色社会主义政治经济学探索的先行者——纪念谷书堂教授逝世一周年|last=逄锦聚|date=24 March 2017|agency=南开大学报}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, NKIE started to work on the major state research project "the formation of planned price"&lt;ref name="计划价格形成问题讨论会"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=福英|date=20 September 1984|title=南开大学经济研究所召开计划价格形成问题讨论会|journal=价格理论与实践}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was authorized to grant doctorates to students.

In 1987, the subdivision of Global Economy of NKIE became a separate [[Nankai Institute of International Economy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=20 July 2014|title=南开大学国际经济研究所|journal=经济研究|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, proposed by the geographer Bao Juemin, the director of the Cultural Geography Studies of the [[Geographical Society of China]], NKIE opened a new research branch of Economic Geography, which was the first research facility of economic geography set under an institute of economics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=楚义芳|date=1 April 1988|title=南开大学经济研究所成立经济地理室|journal=经济地理}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 1998, Chen Zongsheng took the position of the director of NKIE and focused the research on the problems of individual incomes and the transformation of economic system in developing countries. In 2002, the research branch of Urban and Regional Economy became the independent [[Institute of Urban and Regional Economy]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=南开大学城市与区域经济研究所|journal=学习探索|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2012, Nankai Institute of Economics celebrated its 85 years of operation.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所庆祝成立85周年2" /&gt; In October 2017, the previous director [[Chen Zongsheng]] won the eighth China's Economic Theory Innovation Award for his theory of "income distribution in China's economic transformation and development".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnr.cn/native/city/20171024/t20171024_523998566.shtml|title=南开大学陈宗胜教授荣获第八届中国经济理论创新奖|last=陈庆滨|date=24 October 2017|access-date=9 December 2017|agency=央广网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic researches ==
[[File:He_Lian.jpg|thumb|He Lian, the first director of NKIE]]

He Lian, the founder of NKIE, believes that price is the center of all economic activities according to the theory of economics,&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt; while statistics and price index are "the barometer of economy" to observe the changing price and "examine the purchasing power of the currency", which should be "referred to when doing business".&lt;ref name="何廉回忆录" /&gt; When Nankai Committee of Sociology and Economics was first established in September 1927, they decided to start their research with the compilation of a wholesale price index in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As the institute grew larger and the research area expanded, the index began to include quantity of import and export commodities and wholesale price in China; rate of foreign currencies in Tianjin and Shanghai; price of domestic currency, price of silver, customer price, price of essential commodities and living cost in Shanghai; wholesale price and living cost of workers in Tianjin; salary in large cities and counties; price of commodities in Chongqing during wartime, income of teachers, living costs of landlords, businessmen and workers in Chongqing; and industrial productivity in Northern China during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1948|title=战时华北工业生产指数|journal=经济评论|volume=2|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these indexes were important guides to study the economy in China during that period. For instance, the English economic historian [[R. H. Tawney|Richard H. Tawney]] wrote ''Land and Labor in China'' during his visit to China from 1929 to 1930, making use of the materials and research results of NKIE.&lt;ref name="南开大学经济研究所建所85周年纪事"&gt;{{cite news|title=知中国 服务中国——南开大学经济研究所建所85周年纪事|author1=张雁、陈建强|date=17 October 2012|agency=光明日报}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11084">The '''National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease''' ('''NCFAD'''), located in the [[Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health]] in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is part of the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]’s National Centres for Animal Disease. NCFAD is co-located with the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]’s [[National Microbiology Laboratory]].

NCFAD provides state-of-the-art scientific expertise and technologies for the prevention, detection, control and reporting of foreign animal diseases (FAD) and emerging animal diseases. The lab has diagnostic capabilities for a large number of FADs including, but not limited to: avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and Nipah and Hendra virus infections.

The NCFAD has received designations by the [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE)e as a reference laboratory for both highly pathogenic avian influenza and for classical swine fever, in recognition of excellence in diagnostic competency, test method development, validation, research, collaboration and training.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/XX_LIST_LAB.pdf OIE Reference Experts and Disease Index].&lt;/ref&gt; The NCFAD is also accredited to the international quality standard, ISO/IEC 17025 for both diagnostics and research. ISO accreditation means that an international level of standardization has been met; this ensures state-of-the-art technology, worldwide compatibility and competence in diagnostic and research activities.

== Mandate and Role ==

The mandate of the NCFAD is to provide scientific and laboratory services for the rapid and accurate identification and reporting of foreign animal diseases. The lab has five main functions: Testing services; technology development and research; training; scientific advice; and international consultation.

NCFAD staff are experts in tests to detect FAD agents, and they perform many of these tests on a routine basis to meet requirements for import, export, and domestic disease control - including surveillance, the provision of confirmatory testing of suspect material, and reference laboratory services. NCFAD scientists also undertake research to develop better testing technologies for FADs. Staff also serve on international committees; maintain international linkages and collaborations with FAD experts in other countries; and provide training to veterinarians, graduate students, and technologists.

One of the methods for providing this training is through a specialized annual course that focuses on FAD recognition, diagnosis and pathogenesis (the origins and development of disease and the mechanisms that cause disease).  It is the only facility in Canada that is equipped to present this course. Participants include CFIA field veterinarians, veterinary pathologists from Canada’s teaching colleges, and veterinary diagnosticians from provincial laboratories.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/agen/broch/sciwortrav5e.shtml#tc52 Foreign animal disease recognition training].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

NCFAD is organized into several Sections and Units:

'''Classical Swine Fever/Avian Influenza''' – This Section provides diagnostic testing services, technology development, research, training, and scientific consultation services. Diseases of primary concern are: classical swine fever, African swine fever, Newcastle disease, and notifiable avian influenza. This Section has expertise in the detection, isolation, identification, sequencing and characterization of viruses using conventional and molecular techniques. In addition to OIE Reference Laboratory status for classical swine fever and avian influenza, this Section is also the National Reference Laboratory and as such aides coordination of the network of provincial/university diagnostic animal health laboratories across Canada.

'''Vesicular Diseases''' – This Section provides testing services, technology development and research, training, and scientific consultation services for vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis.  This Section is also involved in the study of host responses, disease transmission and pathogenesis of vesicular diseases.  Both in vivo and in vitro work is carried out under strict containment conditions.

'''Serology/Immunology''' – This Section conducts both scheduled and special tests for the detection of antibodies to foreign animal disease agents in addition to assay development, validation, training and scientific consultation services.  The bulk of scheduled tests (avian influenza, Newcastle disease, bluetongue, pseudorabies, vesicular stomatitis and epizootic hemorrhagic disease) involve the use of validated test methods on traditional farm animal species and the qualification of these animals or their products for movement into, out of, or within Canada and in support of national sero-surveys required by Canada’s trading partners and the OIE to maintain the country’s disease-free status.  The Section provides this service for NCFAD as well as for the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN).

'''Zoonotics/Emerging Diseases (Special Pathogens)''' – This is the Containment Level 4 (CL4) Section of NCFAD. CL4 is where scientists can work safely with the most serious viruses. The Section provides expertise in the area of special pathogens, particularly the CL4 agents and zoonotic containment level 3 agents of veterinary importance such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Ebola virus and Rift Valley fever virus. The Section maintains a state of readiness for emergencies or outbreak situations through research, technical development, training and scientific consultation. Protected by positive pressure suits, bench work with infectious agents is conducted in a highly specialized CFIA containment level 4 laboratory. Attached directly to this laboratory is a containment cubicle that allows work with large animals under the CL4 conditions.  The staff members receive extensive training prior to work in CL4 and CL3 zoonotic.

'''Reagent Development''' - The Reagent Development Section has expertise in the characterization and production of reagents used in diagnostic testing and research to ensure efficient and reliable supply of high quality reagents and cells for use in diagnostic testing and research.  The mandate for the reagent development unit is to provide three core services to NCFAD.  These services involve the production and characterization of: 1) monoclonal antibodies 2) recombinant proteins and 3) mammalian, avian and insect cells. Each of the services is provided by research and technical staff who specialize in up-to-date technologies relating to the efficient productions of quality reagents.

'''Pathology''' – The Pathology Section at the NCFAD delivers diagnostic services by conducting histopathological, electron microscopical and immunohistochemical tests for the diagnosis of a broad range of infectious animal diseases foreign to Canada.  The unit also investigates the pathogenesis of foreign animal and emerging diseases, for example: avian influenza, Nipah virus infection, Rift Valley fever, capripox, lumpy skin disease, glanders, and classical swine fever.

'''Animal Care''' – The Animal Care Unit collaborates in diagnostic and research activities involving the use of animals.  This unit is involved in assays for the determination of pathogenicity indices for avian viruses, the production of serum standards for diagnostic test methods, and research projects on disease pathogenesis. NCFAD primarily works with farm animals such as pigs, chickens and cattle in order to carry out its mandate. The Animal Care Unit consists of a veterinarian and laboratory animal technologists.  This unit is devoted to the best possible care for the animals and ensures that all animal use meets or exceeds the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC).

== History ==

In the 1980s, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada identified both the need for new laboratories including high-containment space (Containment Level 3 and 4). Around the same time, Health Canada was also considering the need to replace outdated laboratories and add Containment Level 4. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement was made in October 1987.

After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba’s medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official groundbreaking in December 1992. The design team, headed by the Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc., visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction finished toward the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in 1999.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074113/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_81_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the animal health programs began moving into the new facility, they had become part of the new Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The agency was created in April 1997 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act &lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-16.5/ CFIA Act].&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of combining and integrating the related inspection services of three separate federal government departments: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Health Canada. The establishment of the CFIA consolidated the delivery of all federal food safety, animal health, and plant health regulatory programs.

== Containment ==

In addition to operating a Containment Level (CL) 2 laboratory as well as extensive CL3 laboratories, NCFAD also operates a Containment Level 4 laboratory, which provides the capability to work safely with the most serious viruses.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/sci/bio/anima/convet/convet1-3e.shtml#a2 Animal Pathogen Containment Levels].&lt;/ref&gt; A Level 4 laboratory is designed for agents that usually produce very serious and untreatable diseases, which can be spread easily through airborne or casual contact. All animal diseases classed as Level 4 are zoonotic, meaning that they can transfer to humans. Staff wear pressurized biosafety suits which are disinfected after each session. All air and waste are sterilized on exit.

== Workforce ==

NCFAD maintains a staff of approximately 65 people; primarily scientists and laboratory technicians.

The '''National Museum of Music''' is in [[Ouagadougou]], ([[Burkina Faso]]) in a two-story building on Oubritenga Avenue on the south side of the Phillipe Zinda Kabore School.  

The building that once housed the [[Association for the Development of African Architecture and Urban Planning]] (ADAUA) was renovated to accommodate the [[museum]]. The building is in Sudanese Sahelian style with dome-shaped roofs. It is in the centre of the city and is easily accessible to the general public.

The first collection, put together between September 1998 and March 1999, is constantly growing. Instruments from all families are represented including [[aerophone]]s, [[membranophone]]s, [[idiophone]]s and [[chordophone]]s. Each object is the only one of its kind and varies from 5 to 200 years in age.

The museum is headed by the curator, [[Parfait Z. Bambara]]

The '''Nun Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease''' is a continuing [[longitudinal study]], begun in 1986, to examine the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[David Snowdon]], the founding Nun Study investigator, began the research at the [[University of Minnesota]], but moved it to the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1986. In 2008, with Snowdon's retirement, the study returned to the University of Minnesota. Similar environmental influences and general lifestyles among the participants make the nuns an ideal population to study, and although it is ongoing it has yielded several findings. At the University of Minnesota, Kelvin Lim and Laura Hemmy are developing a new Alzheimer's Disease study working with the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trust &amp; Dare'', newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1992, researchers at [[Rush University Medical Center]] [[Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center]] (RADC), building on the success of the Nun Study, proposed the [[Rush Religious Orders Study]]. The Religious Orders Study was funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]] in 1993, and is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Overview and Findings from the Religious Orders Study, Curr Alzheimer Res. 2012 July 1:9(6): 628-645.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Minnesota are collaborating with the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center on the Religious Orders Study, as well as several other ongoing studies.&lt;ref&gt;Trust &amp; Dare, newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Nun Study, begun in 1986 with funding by the National Institute on Aging, focuses on a group of 678 American [[Roman Catholic]] sisters who are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Studying a relatively homogeneous group (no drug use, little or no alcohol, similar housing and reproductive histories, etc.) minimizes the extraneous [[variable (research)|variable]]s that may confound other similar research.

==Current findings==
Researchers have also accessed the convent archive to review documents amassed throughout the lives of the nuns in the study. Among the documents reviewed were autobiographical essays that had been written by the nuns upon joining the sisterhood; upon review, it was found that an essay's lack of linguistic density (e.g., complexity, vivacity, fluency) functioned as a [[statistical significance|significant]] predictor of its author's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. The approximate mean age of the nuns at the time of writing was merely 22 years. Roughly 80% of nuns whose writing was measured as lacking in linguistic density went on to develop Alzheimer's disease in old age; meanwhile, of those whose writing was not lacking, only 10% later developed the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR: Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study Neurobiology of Aging 26(3):341347, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, findings of the Nun Study suggest "that traits in early, mid, and late life have strong relationships with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the [[mental  disabilities|mental]] and [[cognitive disabilities]] of old age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp The University of Minnesota's Nun Study FAQ page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512190448/http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp |date=2010-05-12 }}, December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
* 1921: First poison laboratory within the Soviet secret services was established under the name "Special Office". It was headed by professor of medicine Ignatii Kazakov, according to [[Pavel Sudoplatov]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"&gt;Vadim J. Birstein. ''The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.'' Westview Press (2004) {{ISBN|0-8133-4280-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1926: The laboratory was under the supervision of [[Genrikh Yagoda]], a deputy of [[OGPU]] chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]], who became [[NKVD]] chief in 1934 after Menzhinsky's death.
*February 20, 1939: It becomes ''Laboratory 1'' headed by [[Grigory Mairanovsky]]. The laboratory was under the direct supervision of NKVD director [[Lavrenty Beria]] and his deputy [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] from 1939 to March 1953.
*March 14, 1953: It was renamed to ''Laboratory 12''. V. Naumov is the newly appointed head. [[Lavrenty Beria]] and [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] were executed after Stalin's death. Immediate NKVD supervisor of the laboratory, [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], received a long term in prison.
*1978: Expanded into the ''Central Investigation Institute for Special Technology'' within the [[First Chief Directorate]] of the [[KGB]].
*Since 1991: Several laboratories of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (headquartered in [[Yasenevo District|Yasenevo]] near [[Moscow]]) are responsible for the "creation of biological and toxin weapons for clandestine operations in the West".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kouzminov ''Biological Espionage: Special Operations of the Soviet and Russian Foreign Intelligence Services in the West'', Greenhill Books, 2006, {{ISBN|1-85367-646-2}} {{cite web |url=http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425151231/http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human experimentation==

Mairanovsky and his colleagues tested a number of deadly poisons on prisoners from the [[Gulag]]s ("[[enemies of the people]]"), including [[mustard gas]], [[ricin]], [[digitoxin]], [[curare]], cyanide, and many others.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;Andrew Meier. 2008. ''The Lost Spy: An American in Stalin's Secret Service'', W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the experiments was to find a tasteless, odourless chemical that could not be detected ''post-mortem''. Candidate poisons were given to the victims, with a meal or drink, as "medication".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

Finally, a preparation with the desired properties called C-2 or K-2 (carbylamine choline chloride) was developed.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Laurence, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXiJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Murder Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Volodarsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFd-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The KGB's Poison Factory], page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to witness testimonies, the victim changed physically, became shorter, weakened quickly, became calm and silent, and died within fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; Mairanovsky brought to the laboratory people of varied physical condition and ages in order to have a more complete picture about the action of each poison.

[[Pavel Sudoplatov]] and [[Nahum Eitingon]] approved special equipment (i.e., poisons) only if it had been tested on "humans", according to testimony of Mikhail Filimonov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|Vsevolod Merkulov]] said that these experiments were approved by NKVD chief [[Lavrenty Beria]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; After his arrest, Beria himself testified on August 28, 1953, that "I gave orders to Mairanovsky to conduct experiments on people sentenced to the highest measure of punishment, but it was not my idea".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

In addition to human experimentation, Mairanovsky personally executed people with poisons, under the supervision of Sudoplatov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grani"&gt;[http://grani.ru/Politics/World/Europe/Ukraine/m.81346.html History of Soviet poisonings (Russian)] by [[Boris Vadimovich Sokolov|Boris Sokolov]] grani.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged victims==
* Russian writer [[Maksim Gorky]] and his son. During the [[Trial of the Twenty One]] in 1938, NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] admitted that he poisoned to death Maksim Gorky and his son and unsuccessfully tried to poison future NKVD boss [[Nikolay Yezhov]]. The attempted poisoning of Yezhov was later officially dismissed as falsification, but [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] believed that the poisoning accusations were true. Yagoda was never officially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] (recognized as an innocent victim of political repressions) by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;
* Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Russian historians [[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]] and [[Edvard Radzinsky]] believe that Stalin was poisoned by associates of NKVD chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], based on the interviews of a former Stalin bodyguard and numerous circumstantial evidence.

*[[Georgi Dimitrov]], the first Communist leader of Bulgaria, fell ill in 1949 and was sent to a Moscow hospital.  His body was mummified and placed in a mausoleum.  Stalin had no reason to have Dimitrov killed, because Dimitrov was his most loyal servant. However, Dimitrov had an idea of joining Bulgaria with Tito's Yugoslav Federation, which was not in the plans of Stalin.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5353">'''Prebendalism''' refers to [[political systems]] where [[elected officials]], and [[government]] workers feel they have a right to a share of government revenues, and use them to benefit their supporters, co-religionists and members of their [[ethnic group]].

==Origins of the term ==

''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' defines a [[Prebendary|prebend]] as the "right of member of chapter to his share in the revenues of a cathedral".&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12371a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] used the term to describe India and China in the early Middle Ages in his 1915 book The Religion of China&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'' (Free Press, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1916 book The Religion of India.&lt;ref name="WeberInd"&gt;Max Weber, ''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' (Free Press, 1958), pp 70–71, as quoted by Immanuel Wallerstein in ''The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of California Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The occidental [[seigneurie]], like the oriental Indian, developed through the disintegration of the central authority of the patrimonial state power—the disintegration of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the Occident, the disintegration of the [[Caliphs]] and the [[Maharadja]] or [[Great Moguls]] in India. In the Carolingian Empire, however, the new stratum developed on the basis of a rural subsistence economy. Through oath-bound vassalage, patterned after the war following, the stratum of lords was joined to the king and interposed itself between the freemen and the king. Feudal relations were also to be found in India, but they were not decisive for the formation either of a nobility or landlordism. &lt;br&gt; In India, as in the Orient generally, a characteristic seigniory developed rather out of tax farming and the military and tax prebends of a far more bureaucratic state. The oriental seigniory therefore remained in essence, a "prebend" and did not become a "fief"; not feudalization, but prebendalization of the patrimonial state occurred. The comparable, though undeveloped, occidental parallel is not the medieval fief but the purchase of offices and prebends during the papal [[seicento]] or during the days of the French [[Noblesse de Robe]].&lt;ref name="WeberInd" /&gt; }}

Alavi describes how state-derived rights over capital held by state officials in parts of India in the early 18th Century were held to be of a patron-client nature and thus volatile. They were thus converted where possible into hereditary entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;Seema Alavi, ''The 18th Century in India'' (New Delhi, 2002), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Nigeria==

Richard A. Joseph, director of The Program of African Studies at [[Northwestern University]], is usually credited with first using the term to describe patron-clientelism or [[neopatrimonialism]] in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Richard A., ''Democracy and Prebendal Politics in Nigeria: The Rise and Fall of the Second Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the term has commonly been used in scholarly literature and textbooks.

Joseph wrote in 1996, "According to the theory of prebendalism, state offices are regarded as prebends that can be appropriated by officeholders, who use them to generate material benefits for themselves and their constituents and kin groups..."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Richard, "Nigeria: Inside the Dismal Tunnel," ''Current History'', May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of that kind of patron-client or [[identity politics]], Nigeria has regularly been one of the lowest ranked nations for political transparency by [[Transparency International]] in its [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2006 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416023729/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2006 |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses include the corruption investigations into the activities of 31 out of 36 Nigerian governors,&lt;ref&gt;"Nigerian governors in graft probe" at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5387814.stm&lt;/ref&gt; the frequent comments in the Nigerian press about the problems of corruption (for example, Victor E. Dike's article in the ''Daily Champion'' of Lagos, "Nigeria: Governance and Nigeria's Ailing Economy"&lt;ref&gt;Dike, Victor E., "Nigeria: Governance and Nigeria's Ailing Economy," ''Daily Champion'' (Lagos), http://allafrica.com/stories/200612130710.html&lt;/ref&gt;) and the common defenses of prebendalism as necessary for justice and equality in government funding (for example Oliver O. Mbamara's editorial, "In Defense of Nigeria: Amidst the Feasting of Critics" at ''Africa Events''.&lt;ref&gt;Mbamara, Oliver O., "In Defense of Nigeria: Amidst the Feasting of Critics," ''Africa Events'', http://www.africanevents.com/Essay-InDefenseOfNigeria0606.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rough fuzzy hybridization''' is a method of [[hybrid intelligent system]] or [[soft computing]], where [[Fuzzy set]] theory is used for linguistic representation of patterns, leading to a ''fuzzy granulation'' of the [[feature space]]. [[Rough set]] theory is used to obtain dependency rules which model informative regions in the granulated feature space.

'''Route reconnaissance''' is the [[intelligence assessment]] of the operational environment in reconnaissance operations of routes for military use, including methods of reconnoitering and classifying them for other troops. In a [[tactical area of responsibility]] during [[combat operations]] the primary purpose of conducting route reconnaissance is to find and report all enemy forces that can interfere with movement along a route, and to identify the limit of [[direct-fire]] range and [[dominant terrain|terrain]] that dominates the route. Route reconnaissance includes creation of reconnaissance overlays to identify land and water features, bridge reconnaissance and [[bridge classification|classification]], [[road reconnaissance]] and [[road structure and design|classification]], [[special terrain reconnaissance]] such as that used during [[cross-country movement]], at the [[landing area]]s, on the [[inland waterway]]s, or when using footpaths and [[trail]]s, [[engineer reconnaissance]], and use of [[military route sign]]s (standard signs, sign lighting, bridge signs). A significant part of route reconnaissance is the ability to identify [[choke point]]s that prohibit military traffic by using [[conversion factors and tables]] to identify non-standard surfaces or inadequate [[load bearing]] in structure. To do so, [[Military Load Classification]]s are used for standard vehicles of a given [[armed force]]. Route reconnaissance is typically conducted by a foot, horse or vehicle-mounted [[route reconnaissance patrol]], sometimes with aid of [[aerial reconnaissance aircraft]]. The patrol would include regular [[reconnaissance]] elements and a [[combat engineering]] team.

[[File:Fern-frond-sori.jpg|thumb|right|The sporophyll of a fern. It is a fertile leaf bearing reproductive structures.]]
A '''sporophyll''' is a [[leaf]] that bears [[sporangia]]. Both microphylls and megaphylls can be sporophylls. In heterosporous plants, sporophylls (whether they are microphylls or megaphylls) bear either megasporangia and thus are called '''megasporophylls''', or microsporangia and are called '''microsporophylls'''. The overlap of the prefixes and roots makes these terms a particularly confusing subset of botanical nomenclature.

Sporophylls vary greatly in appearance and structure, and may or may not look similar to sterile leaves. Plants that produce sporophylls include:

''[[Alaria esculenta]]'' a brown alga shows sporophylls attached near the base of the alga.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Carola I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds''. The Kew Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lycophyte]]s, where sporophylls may be aggregated into [[strobilus|strobili]] (''Selaginella'' and some ''Lycopodium'' and related genera) or distributed singly among sterile leaves (''[[Huperzia]]''). Sporangia are borne in the axil or on the adaxial surface of the sporophyll. In heterosporous members, megasporophylls and microsporophylls may be intermixed or separated in a variety of patterns.

[[Fern]]s, which may produce sporophylls that are similar to sterile fronds or that appear very different from sterile fronds. These may be non-photosynthetic and lack typical pinnae (e.g. ''Onoclea'')

[[Cycad]]s produce strobili, both pollen-producing and seed-producing, that are composed of sporophylls. 

''[[Ginkgo]]'' produces microsporophylls aggregated into a pollen strobilus. Ovules are not born on sporophylls {{Citation needed|reason=the structure that carries the seed and arillus of Ginko can and has been interpreted as a leave (This means that Ovules are in Ginko born on megasphorophylls), why should this be wrong now?|date=October 2017}}.

Conifers, like ''Ginkgo'' and cycads, produce microsporophylls, aggregated into pollen strobili. However, unlike these other groups, ovules are produced on cone scales, which are modified shoots rather than sporophylls.

Some plants do not produce sporophylls. Sporangia are produced directly on stems. ''Psilotum'' has been interpreted as producing sporangia (fused in a synangium) on the terminus of a stem. ''[[Equisetum]]'' always produce strobili, but the structures bearing sporangia (sporangiophores) have been interpreted as [[Aerial stem modification|modified stems]]. The sporangia, despite being recurved are interpreted as terminal. 

[[Gnetophyte]]s produce both compound pollen and seed strobili.

[[Image:Replica of the Stone of Scone, Scone Palace, Scotland (8924541883).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Stone of Scone, Scone Palace]]
The '''Stone of Scone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|uː|n}}; {{lang-gd|An Lia Fàil}}, {{lang-sco|Stane o Scuin}})—also known as the '''Stone of Destiny''', and often referred to in England as '''The Coronation Stone'''—is an oblong block of red [[sandstone]] that was used for centuries in the [[coronation]] of the [[monarchs of Scotland]], and later the [[monarchs of England]] and those [[List of British monarchs|of the United Kingdom]]. Historically, the artefact &lt;!-- "artefact" is correct NVOE; do not modify to foreign "artifact" --&gt; was kept at the now-ruined [[Scone Abbey]] in [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland]]. It is also known as [[Jacob's Pillow-Pillar Stone|Jacob's Pillow Stone]] and the [[Tanistry|Tanist]] Stone, and in Scottish Gaelic, ''clach-na-cinneamhain''. Its size is approximately {{convert|660|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} by {{convert|425|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|267|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and its weight is approximately {{convert|152|kg|lb|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. A roughly incised cross is on one surface, and an iron ring at each end aids with transport.&lt;ref name="The"&gt;{{cite web|title=The stone of Destiny|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/stone_scone.html|website=English Monarchs|publisher=www.englishmonarcs.co.uk|accessdate=30 August 2014|year=2004–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stone of Scone was last used in 1953 for the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].

==Tradition and history==
[[File:Stone of Scone replica.jpg|thumb|Replica of the Stone of Scone at [[Scone Palace]]]]

===Origin and legends===
In the 14th century, the English cleric and historian [[Walter Hemingford]] described the previous location of the Scottish coronation stone as the [[Scone Abbey|monastery of Scone]], 3km north of Perth:
{{quote|{{lang|la|Apud Monasterium de Scone positus est lapis pergrandis in ecclesia Dei, juxta magnum altare, concavus quidem ad modum rotundae cathedrae confectus, in quo futuri reges loco quasi coronationis ponebantur ex more.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Skene |first=William Forbes |author-link=William Forbes Skene |year=1869 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=The Coronation Stone |volume= |edition= |publisher=Edmonston &amp; Douglas |publication-date=1869 |publication-place=Edinburgh |pages=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvwHAAAAQAAJ |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the monastery of Scone, in the church of God, near to the high altar, was placed a large stone, hollowed out as a round chair, on which future kings were placed for their coronation, according to custom.}}

Various theories and legends exist about the stone's history prior to its placement in Scone:

*One story concerns [[Fergus I|Fergus, son of Erc]], the first King of the Scots in Scotland, whose transport of the Stone from Ireland to Argyll, where he was crowned in it, was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Andree, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some versions identify the stone brought by Fergus with the [[Lia Fáil]] used at [[Tara, County Meath|Tara]] for the [[High King of Ireland]]. Other traditions contend the Lia Fáil remains at Tara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danvers |first=Frederick Charles |title=The covenant; or, Jacob's heritage |publisher=William Henry Guest |year=1877 |pages=226–233 |url=https://archive.org/stream/covenantorjacob00danvgoog#page/n242/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrie|first=George|year=1839|title=On the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill|journal=The Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy:|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|volume=18|pages=159–162|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-30078991/30078991#page/n137/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Inis Fáil, The Island of Destiny, is one of the traditional names of Ireland.)
*Legends place the origins of the Stone in [[Bible|Biblical]] times and consider the Stone to be the [[Stone of Jacob]], taken by [[Jacob]] while in [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]], (Genesis 28:10–22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/35-runaway-bribe-genesis-2810-22|title=Genesis 28:10-22|publisher=Bible.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologists proved that the stone taken by [[Edward I of England]] to Westminster&lt;ref&gt;'The Stone of Destiny: Symbol of Nationhood' by David Breeze and Graeme Munro&lt;/ref&gt; is a "lower [[Old Red Sandstone]]", which was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.&lt;ref&gt;John Prebble, ''The Lion in the North''&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts over the authenticity of the stone have existed for a long time: a [[blog]] post by retired Scottish academic and writer of historical fiction Marie MacPherson shows that they date back at least two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Marie MacPherson|title=The Stone of Destiny|url=http://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-stone-of-destiny.html|website=English Historical Fiction Authors|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=30 August 2014|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter to the editor of the ''Morning Chronicle'', dated 2 January 1819, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, weighing about 500lb [{{convert|500|lb|disp=output only}}], which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi-metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages since Macbeth's reign. Beside it were also found two round tablets, of a composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which a gentleman has thus deciphered.— 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the figures of targets for the arms. From time immemorial it has been believed among us here, that unseen hands brought Jacob's pillow from Bethel and dropped it on the site where the palace of Scoon now stands. A strong belief is also entertained by many in this part of the country that it was only a representation of this Jacob's pillow that Edward sent to Westminster, the sacred stone not having been found by him. The curious here, aware of such traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to discover its real quality.&lt;ref name="The" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Westminster Abbey===
[[File:Coronation Chair and Stone of Scone.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1855]]
In 1296, the stone was captured by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as [[Looting|spoils of war]] and taken to [[Westminster Abbey]], where it was fitted into a wooden chair—known as [[King Edward's Chair]]—on which most subsequent English and then British sovereigns have been crowned. Edward I sought to claim his status as the "Lord Paramount" of Scotland, with the right to oversee its King.&lt;ref&gt;Arundell, Brian, of Wardour Howard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfCHMBR7JkAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Jacob%27s+Pillar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1wr7UvGcBMqT2QWgtYDwCA&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Gaels&amp;f=false ''Judah Scepter: A Historical and Religious Perspective''], iUnivers (2010) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doubt exists over the stone captured by Edward I. The [[Westminster Stone theory]] posits that the [[monk]]s at [[Scone Palace]] hid the real stone in the [[River Tay]], or buried it on [[Dunsinane Hill]], and that the English troops were tricked into taking a substitute. Some proponents of the theory claim that historic descriptions of the stone do not match the present stone.&lt;ref name=pillow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/salmond-stone-of-destiny-is-fake-1-1433959|title=Salmond: 'Stone of Destiny is fake'|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton|The Treaty of Northampton]] 1328, between the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the [[Kingdom of England]], England agreed to return the captured stone to Scotland; riotous crowds prevented it from being removed from Westminster Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Christopher "Bannockburn 1314"&lt;/ref&gt; The stone remained in England for another six centuries, even after [[James VI of Scotland]] assumed the English throne as [[James I of England]]. For the next century, the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings and queens of Scotland once again sat on the stone but at their coronation as kings and queens of England.

===Removal and damage===
{{Main article|Removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950}}

On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson, and Alan Stuart) removed the stone from Westminster Abbey for return to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |title=Blog Archive » Emotion Nationalism And The Brave-Heart Factor |publisher=Ian Hamilton Qc |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712235747/http://www.ianhamiltonqc.com/blog/?p=269 |archive-date=12 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the removal process, the stone broke into two pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/25/scotland.britishidentity |title=Film on Stone of Destiny heist 'will end UK' |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Olga Craig |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |publisher=Telegraph |date=14 Dec 2008 |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After burying the greater part of the Stone in a [[Kent]] field, where they camped for a few days,&lt;ref name="Guardian 14Oct2008"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/14/heritage-scotland |title=The Caledonian job |last=Scott |first=Kirsty |work=The Guardian |date=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; they uncovered the buried stone and returned to Scotland, along with a new accomplice, John Josselyn. According to one US diplomat who was posted in Edinburgh at the time, the stone was hidden for a short time in a trunk in the basement of the Consulate's Public Affairs Officer, unknown to him, before it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2014/09/scotland-a-land-apart/ |title=ADST Interview with FSO Robert Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although English, Josselyn, who was then a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], was a Scottish Nationalist. Edward I was Josselyn's 21st great-grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/25017403/person/1650035497 | title=John Rodney Josselyn – Overview – Ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller piece was similarly brought north at a later time. The entire stone was passed to a senior [[Glasgow]] politician, who arranged for it to be professionally repaired by Glasgow [[stonemason]] [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scone-palace.co.uk/palace-grounds/stone-of-destiny|title=The Stone of Destiny|date=2013-07-12|work=Scone Palace Perthshire|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXZDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3896%2C2940043 |title=Offer to repair Stone of Destiny |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=17 September 1974 |page=3 |accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major search for the stone was ordered by the [[British Government]], but proved unsuccessful. The custodians left the stone on the altar of [[Arbroath Abbey]] on 11 April 1951, in the safekeeping of the [[Church of Scotland]]. Once the London police were informed of its whereabouts, the stone was returned to Westminster four months after it had been removed. Afterwards, rumours circulated that copies had been made of the stone,{{how|date=April 2017}} and that the returned stone was not the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Richard Blystone|title=Scotland's 'Stone of Scone' finds its way home|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/15/stone.of.scone/|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=CNN|date=15 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sad"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Halloran|title=The Sad, Dark End of the British Empire|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/the-sad-end-of-the-british-empire-110362_Page2.html#.VAGwX0v5lg0|website=Politico Magazine|accessdate=30 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Scotland===
In 1996,&lt;ref name="Sad" /&gt; in a symbolic response to growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement, the British Government decided that the stone should be kept in Scotland when not in use at coronations. On 3 July 1996, it was announced in the House of Commons that the stone would be returned to Scotland, and on 15 November 1996, after a handover ceremony at the border between representatives of the [[Home Office]] and of the [[Scottish Office]], it was transported to [[Edinburgh Castle]]. The stone arrived in the Castle on 30 November 1996, [[St Andrew's Day]], where the official handover ceremony occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/scotland-welcomes-the-new-stone-age-1312444.html |title=Scotland welcomes the new Stone age |first=Neal |last=Ascherson |authorlink=Neal Ascherson |work=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |date= 1 Dec 1996 |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], representing Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over the [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] transferring the stone into the safekeeping of the [[Honours of Scotland#Commissioners for the Safekeeping of the Regalia|Commissioners for the Regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/index.php/20-lesser-known-facts-about-the-stone-of-destiny-20-facts-for-20-years |title=20 lesser known facts about the Stone of Destiny – 20 facts for 20 years! - Edinburgh Castle Blog |date=30 November 2016 |publisher= |accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ceremonial of the day: {{Edinburgh Gazette|city=e |issue=24101 |pages=2861–2862 |date=29 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently remains alongside the crown jewels of Scotland, the [[Honours of Scotland]], in the Crown Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/discover/highlights/the-stone-of-destiny |title=The Stone Of Destiny |website= edinburghcastle.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5356">'''Studium Biblicum Franciscanum''' is a [[Franciscan]] [[academic society]] based in [[Jerusalem]]. It is a center of biblical and archaeological research and studies.

== Organization ==

Founded in 1924, the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum is since 2001 the faculty for Biblical Sciences and Archaeology of the [[Pontifical University Antonianum]], the Franciscan university in Rome. Its main seat is the Flagellation Monastery in the [[Via Dolorosa]] in [[Jerusalem]].

It has a branch in [[Hong Kong]], founded in [[Beijing]] in 1945 by [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[Gabriele Allegra]], which produced the first complete translation of the [[Catholic]] [[Bible]] in Chinese in 1968 after a 40-year effort. The [[Studium Biblicum Translation]] is often considered ''the'' Chinese Bible among Catholics.

== Publications ==

The SBF publishes a number of scientific publications: the theological-archaeological journal ''[[Liber Annuus]]'' ISSN 0081-8933 with scientific articles in different languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/LA.pdf Liber annuus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131924/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/LA.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} — Texts of the volumes '''39''' to '''56 ''' (1989–2006) (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and the series "Collectio Maior", "Collectio Minor", "Analecta" and "Museum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbf.custodia.org/default.asp?id=556] — The Publications of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and Studies ==

The SBF offers two academic degrees, the [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] and the [[Doctorate]] in Biblical Sciences and Archaeology, a diploma in biblical-oriental sciences, a biblical diploma, and a philosophical-theological curriculum in the "[[Studium Theologicum Jerosolymitanum]]“. The language of teaching is Italian.

Fields of study and research are Old and New Testament exegesis, biblical and Christian history, biblical and Middle Eastern languages, and biblical archaeology with several excavations conducted by the SBF. The main discoveries are exhibited in a museum, including the oldest Georgian ''[[Bir el Qutt inscriptions]]''.

The library contains appr. 50.000 volumes and 420 journals in the areas of archaeology, biblical studies, Christian and Jewish history, and ancient travel accounts of the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;Associazione di Terra Santa: [http://www.proterrasancta.org/bibliothek-franziskaner/ ''Studium Biblicum Franciscanum: the library in Jerusalem''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415191034/http://www.proterrasancta.org/bibliothek-franziskaner/ |date=2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Music Education|major}}
The '''Suzuki method''' is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese [[violin]]ist and pedagogue [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] (1898–1998). The method aims to create an [[Nature versus nurture|environment]] for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good [[moral character]].

==Background==
{{quote|I want to make good citizens.  If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance.  He gets a beautiful heart.|Shinichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese [[violin]]ist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the [[German language]] who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider "difficult" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their [[first language|native language]], they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument.  

He pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body.  He modeled his method, which he called {{nihongo|"Talent Education"|才能教育|sainō kyōiku}}, after his theories of natural [[language acquisition]]. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with "noble hearts" (as opposed to creating famous musical [[child prodigy|prodigies]]).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|''...all'' children can be well educated...|Shin'ichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].  The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent [[moral character|character]] in every student).  These components include:

*Saturation in the musical [[community]]. 
::This includes attending local classical music [[concert]]s, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible.
*Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or [[audition]]s to begin music study. 
::Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for "talented" students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
*Emphasis on playing from a very young age,
::typically starting formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old.  (See [[Suzuki method#Technique|Technique]]).
*Using well-trained teachers.
::Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.  
*In the beginning, [[learning music by ear]] is emphasized over reading written [[musical notation]].  
::Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily. Other methods—such as [[Simply Music]], the Gordon Music Learning Theory, and Conversational Solfège—have students playing before reading notes, but may not have the same focus on daily listening and learning by ear.
*Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
::The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use [[sheet music]] to learn new pieces. 
*Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher. 
::The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory &amp; reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
*Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in [[unison]]) is strongly encouraged.
*Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. 
::This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with "preview" parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional [[etude]] books.  Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
*Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.

The method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level.  However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.

The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it "The Mom-Centric Method."&lt;ref name="meyermom"&gt;Meyer, Constance (2003-09-07). The Mom-centric method. LA Times, 7 September 2003. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-meyer7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a "school of violin playing" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin.  However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of "tonalization", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method.  Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each [[academic discipline|discipline]].

*'''Tonalization''' is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word "vocalization" (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices).  Tonalization is defined as the student's ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).  Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is "tone production," and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*Using '''[[sound recording]]s''' is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method.  Thibeault's (2018) history of Suzuki's mediated pedagogy presents Suzuki as a technological innovator who created new ways of learning from sound recordings. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[rhythm]], and beautiful tone quality [[learning music by ear|by ear]]. Suzuki pointed out that great artists (such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) were surrounded with excellent performances from birth, and that the advent of recording technology made this aspect of their environment possible to achieve for large numbers of "ordinary" people whose parents were not themselves great musicians &amp; music teachers like [[Leopold Mozart|Mozart's father]] was.  So-called "traditional" (that is, not Suzuki trained) music educators have used this technique since the earliest days of recording technology; the difference in the Suzuki method is the scale on which Suzuki systematically insisted on daily listening in the home, from before birth if possible, and his focus on using recordings of beginner's repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*"Adult" sized '''instruments are adapted''' to meet the demands of a small child's body in various ways.  This lowers the age at which people are developmentally ready to begin studying an instrument.  Scaled down instrument sizes are used for children studying [[stringed instruments]]. Curved headjoint flutes with displaced keys which are closer together than normal flute keys &amp; holes are also available making it possible for children as young as 3 years old to study the flute through the Suzuki method.  Height adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and string bass.  Although fractional sized student violins were available when Suzuki began to teach, the success and popularity of his idea that pre-school aged children could also learn to play prompted [[luthier|violinmakers]] to scale violins down to even smaller [[violin#Sizes|sizes]] than before.
*'''Suzuki Institutes''' were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers' ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents.  These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki.  In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily [[masterclass]]es; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various 'enrichment' classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities.  As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending.  Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A '''common repertoire''' for all students of an instrument was established.  This body of music allows each student to participate in group classes, helps foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provides motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the 'old' pieces they have learned in top form.  This is in direct contrast to music education outside of the method, in which teachers tailor the repertoire to the current need and level of the individual student.

==Repertoire==
{{quote|...If it is true that "everything in music is preparation" (Gerhart Zimmermann), then the genius of Suzuki is truly expressed in the scope and sequencing of the music....|Edward Kreitman}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The core Suzuki literature is published on [[sound recording|audio recordings]] and in [[sheet music]] books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading.  One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their [[curriculum]], and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.

Another innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day.  He favored a focus on melodic [[song]]-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises.  Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European "classical" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly.  Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Suzuki]].  In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's [[Variation (music)|Variations]] on "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and ending with two [[Mozart]] concertos.  The first 3 books are mostly graded [[arrangements]] of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin &amp; piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as [[Bach]], [[Telemann]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Handel]], [[Paganini]], [[Boccherini]] and [[Brahms]]. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by [[Fritz Seitz|Seitz]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Bach]], [[Veracini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]], [[Rameau]], [[Handel]], [[Mozart]], [[Fiocco]], and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).

Audio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as [[David Nadien]], [[David Cerone]], Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books.  Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by [[Koji Toyoda]], although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 [[Takako Nishizaki]] made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for [[Naxos Records]]. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]],
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]].

===Viola===
The viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by [[Doris Preucil]]. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the [[Baroque]] period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or [[transposition (music)|transposed]]) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature.  The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by [[Telemann]], [[Henri Casadesus|Casadesus]], [[Bach]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]],and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by [[William Preucil]], and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being "French Folk Song".  Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: [[Vivaldi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[David Popper|Popper]], [[Breval]], [[Goltermann]], [[William Henry Squire|Squire]], [[Bach]], [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]], [[Henry Eccles|Eccles]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[von Goens]], [[Sammartini]], [[Haydn]], and [[Boccherini]].

===Piano===
The piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by [[classical period (music)|romantic, classical]] and [[baroque music|baroque]] composers, such as Robert Schumann, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1,  Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B{{Music|b}} by J.S. Bach.  The fifth book begins with the famous "[[Für Elise]]" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn.  The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by [[Mozart]].  This book also includes "[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]" by [[Handel]] and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many [[minuet]]s in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published.  The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume.  The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the [[double bass]] series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by [[Handel]], [[Gossec]], [[Beethoven]], [[Bach]], Webster, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from [[Carnival of the Animals]] by Saint-Saëns, [[Ode to Joy]] by Beethoven, and Largo from the [[New World Symphony]] by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with [[Mary Had a Little Lamb]] and ending in the Flute Concerto by [[Otaka]]. Also included are concerti by [[Mozart]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Ibert]] and [[Quantz]]. Students also study music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Michel Blavet|Blavet]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder.  The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", several Bach Minuets, etc.  Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The [[classical guitar]] repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay.  The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the [[lute]] in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by [[Gaspar Sanz|Sanz]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Matteo Carcassi|Carcassi]], [[Mauro Giuliani|Giuliani]], [[Fernando Sor|Sor]], [[Francisco Tárrega|Tarrega]], [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]], [[Alonso Mudarra|Mudarra]], and Yocoh's [[Sakura Sakura|Sakura]] Variations.  Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown.  George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and [[William Kanengiser]] recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of [[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]] in book 9, which was recorded by [[Scott Tennant]].

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes.  This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique.  Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note.  Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukiharpinfo.com/whats-new-suzuki-harp/book-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels.  Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The [[pipe organ]] repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998.  Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 &amp; 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 &amp; 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

===Early childhood education and Suzuki in the schools===
Although [[early childhood education]] (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI).  Also, a "modified" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

===Supplemental materials===
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s, [[string orchestra]], and [[string quartet]] arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

==Historical notes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In the late 19th century, Japan's borders were [[Meiji period#Economy|opened to trade with the outside world]], and in particular to the importation of [[Western Culture]].  As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the [[Shamisen]], began to manufacture [[violin]]s instead. (''Nurture by Love'' Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a [[phonograph]] recording of [[Franz Schubert]]'s Ave Maria, as played on violin by [[Mischa Elman]].  Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]".  His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument.  At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him.  Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies.  While there, he studied privately with [[Karl Klingler]], but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma.  He met and became friends with [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged him in learning classical music.  He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Japan]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]].  Raising children with "noble hearts" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and "nurtured by love" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto.  TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees).  Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers.  These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in [[Africa]]), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

[[John D. Kendall]] of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (''Nurtured by Love'' Documentary). [[Vilem Sokol]] of the [[Seattle Youth Symphony]] hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system.  Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include [[Roland and Almita Vamos]], Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, [[Betty Haag]], Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Science Network (TSN)''' is a non-profit virtual forum dedicated to science and its impact on society. Initially conceived in 2003 by [[Roger Bingham]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] as a cable science network,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ Michael Shermer.com, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; TSN would soon become a global digital platform. TSN currently offers free access to over 1100 videos&lt;ref name="search" /&gt; of lectures from scientific meetings and long form one-on-one conversations with prominent scientists and communicators of science, including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[V.S. Ramachandran]], [[Helen S. Mayberg]], and [[Barbara Landau]], on topics including education, aging, neuroscience, and stem cells.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 TSN Search]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission, TSN has also sponsored and co-sponsored scientific forums, such as the landmark Symposium and Town Hall meeting, ''Stem cells: science, ethics and politics at the crossroads'', held at the Salk Institute in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/stem-cells-science-ethics-and-politics-at-the-crossroads Stem Cells: Science, Ethics and Politics at the Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salk.edu/insidesalk/pdf/InsideSalkNov04.pdf Inside Salk 11 04]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Beyond Belief'' conference series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programgroup/beyond-belief ''Beyond Belief'' conference series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beyond Belief'' Conference Series==

TSN's signature series ''Beyond Belief'' was conceived to bring together a community of scientists, philosophers, scholars from the humanities, and social commentators. Speakers at these meetings have included [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Harry Kroto]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and [[Stuart Kauffman]]. So far, the following three ''Beyond Belief'' conferences were organized:

===2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival===
''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]'',  the first of The Science Network's annual Beyond Belief symposia, held from November 5 to November 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival ''Beyond Belief: Science, Reason, Religion &amp; Survival'']&lt;/ref&gt; was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "a free-for-all on science and religion," which seemed at times like "the founding convention for a political party built on a single plank: in a world dangerously charged with ideology, science needs to take on an evangelical role, vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told." According to participant [[Melvin Konner]], however, the event came to resemble a "den of vipers” debating the issue, "Should we bash religion with a crowbar or only with a baseball bat?”&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tyson,%20Neil%20DeGrasse&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all ''A Free-for-All on Science and Religion," George Johnson, New York Times, Section F, Page 1, November 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Scientist]] summed up the topics to be discussed as a list of three questions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225780.142-beyond-belief-in-place-of-god.html Michael Brooks and Helen Phillips, New Scientist, November 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can [[science]] help us create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have traditionally sustained societies?
* Can we treat [[religion]] as a natural phenomenon?
* Can we be good without [[God]]? And if not God, then what?

Speakers included physicists [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name = "nyt"/&gt;

===2007: Enlightenment 2.0===
''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'' was the second annual symposium and was held from 31 October to 2 November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0 ''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'']&lt;/ref&gt;  at the Frederic de Hoffmann Auditorium of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

===2008: Candles in the Dark===
''Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark'' was the third annual Beyond Belief symposium. This event was organized by The Science Network and held from 3 October to 6 October 2008 in La Jolla, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|title=2008 Official Website|work=The Science Network|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9141">In [[Telecommunication|communications]], '''traffic policing''' is the process of monitoring [[network packet|network traffic]] for compliance with a [[traffic contract]] and taking steps to enforce that contract. Traffic sources which are aware of a traffic contract may apply [[traffic shaping]] to ensure their output stays within the contract and is thus not discarded. Traffic exceeding a traffic contract may be discarded immediately, marked as non-compliant, or left as-is, depending on administrative policy and the characteristics of the excess traffic.

== Effects ==
The recipient of traffic that has been ''policed'' will observe [[packet loss]] distributed throughout periods when incoming traffic exceeded the contract. If the source does not limit its sending rate (for example, through a [[#Impact on Congestion-Controlled Sources|feedback mechanism]]), this will continue, and may appear to the recipient as if [[link errors]] or some other disruption is causing random packet loss. The received traffic, which has experienced policing en route, will typically comply with the contract, although [[jitter]] may be introduced by elements in the network downstream of the policer.

With reliable protocols, such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] as opposed to [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], the dropped packets will not be acknowledged by the receiver, and therefore will be resent by the emitter, thus generating more traffic.

=== Impact on congestion-controlled sources ===
Sources with feedback-based [[congestion control]] mechanisms (for example [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]) typically adapt rapidly to static policing, converging on a rate just below the policed sustained rate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

&lt;!-- The sentence below seems to be off-topic with respect to the title of this section.
     Also, the reference that might help verify it is not publicly accessible
     (reserved to IEEE members)--&gt;
Co-operative policing mechanisms, such as packet-based discard&lt;ref&gt;Design and applications of ATM LAN/WAN adapters. Bonjour, D.; De Hauteclocque, G.; Le Moal, J. ATM, 1998. ICATM-98., IEEE International Conference, 22-24 Jun 1998 Page(s):191 - 198 Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/ICATM.1998.688177&lt;/ref&gt; facilitate more rapid convergence, higher stability and more efficient resource sharing.  As a result, it may be hard for endpoints to distinguish TCP traffic that has been merely policed from TCP traffic that has been [[traffic shaping|shaped]].

=== Impact in the case of ATM ===
Where [[cell relay|cell]]-level dropping is enforced (as opposed to that achieved through packet-based policing) the impact is particularly severe on longer packets. Since cells are typically much shorter than the maximum packet size, conventional policers discard cells which do not respect packet boundaries, and hence the total amount of traffic dropped will typically be distributed throughout a number of packets. Almost all known [[ATM Adaptation Layer 5#Convergence, segmentation, and reassembly|packet reassembly]] mechanisms will respond to a missing cell by dropping the packet entirely, and consequently a very large number of packet losses can result from moderately exceeding the policed contract.

== Process ==
RFC 2475 describes traffic policing elements like a ''meter'' and a ''dropper''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2475#section-2.3.3.1 IETF RFC 2475] "An Architecture for Differentiated Services" section 2.3.3 - definitions of meter, dropper and marker&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also optionally include a ''marker''. The meter measures the traffic and determines whether or not it exceeds the contract (for example by [[Generic cell rate algorithm|GCRA]]). Where it exceeds the contract, some policy determines if any given [[Protocol data unit|PDU]] is dropped, or if marking is implemented, if and how it is to be marked. Marking can comprise setting a congestion flag (such as [[Explicit Congestion Notification|ECN]] flag of [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[Cell Loss Priority|CLP]] bit of [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]]) or setting a traffic aggregate indication (such as [[Differentiated Services]] Code Point of [[Internet Protocol|IP]]).

In simple implementations, traffic is classified into two categories, or "colors" : compliant (green) and in excess (red). RFC 2697 proposes a more precise classification, with three "colors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2697 IETF RFC 2697] "A Single Rate Three Color Marker"&lt;/ref&gt; In this document, the contract is described through three parameters: '''Committed Information Rate''' (CIR), '''Committed Burst Size''' (CBS), and '''Excess Burst Size''' (EBS). A packet is "green" if it doesn't exceed the CBS, "yellow" if it does exceed the CBS, but not the EBS, and "red" otherwise.

The "single-rate three-color marker" described by RFC 2697 allows for temporary bursts. The bursts are allowed when the line was under-used before they appeared. A more predictable algorithm is described in RFC 2698, which proposes a "double-rate three-color marker".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2698 IETF RFC 2698] "A Two Rate Three Color Marker"&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 2698 defines a new parameter, the Peak Information Rate (PIR). RFC 2859 describes the "Time Sliding Window Three Colour Marker" which meters a traffic stream and marks packets based on measured throughput relative to two specified rates: Committed Target Rate (CTR) and Peak Target Rate (PTR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2859 IETF RFC 2859] "A Time Sliding Window Three Color Marker"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
On Cisco equipment, both traffic policing and shaping are implemented through the [[token bucket]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/qos/configuration/guide/qcfpolsh.html#wp1012025 What is a token bucket?] at Cisco&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic policing in ATM networks is known as [[UPC and NPC|Usage/Network Parameter Control]].&lt;ref&gt;Hiroshi Saito, Teletraffic Technologies in ATM Networks, Artech House, 1993. {{ISBN|0-89006-622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The network can also discard non-conformant traffic in the network (using [[Priority Control]]). The reference for both traffic policing and traffic shaping in ATM (given by the [[ATM Forum]] and the [[ITU-T]]) is the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm ([[GCRA]]), which is described as a version of the [[leaky bucket]] algorithm.&lt;ref name="ATMF-GCRA" &gt;ATM Forum, The User Network Interface (UNI), v. 3.1, Prentice Hall PTR, 1995, {{ISBN|0-13-393828-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITU-T-GCRA"&gt;ITU-T, ''Traffic control and congestion control in B ISDN'', Recommendation I.371, International Telecommunication Union, 2004, Annex A, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Token bucket#Comparison to leaky bucket|comparison of the leaky bucket and token bucket]] algorithms shows that they are simply mirror images of one another, one adding bucket content where the other takes it away and taking away bucket content where the other adds it. Hence, given equivalent parameters, implementations of both algorithms will see exactly the same traffic as conforming and non-conforming.

Traffic policing requires maintenance of numerical statistics and measures for each policed traffic flow, but it does not require implementation or management of significant volumes of packet buffer. Consequently, it is significantly less complex to implement than ''traffic shaping''.

== Connection Admission Control as an alternative ==
[[Connection-oriented]] networks (for example ATM systems) can perform [[Connection Admission Control]] (CAC) based on traffic contracts. In the context of [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP), this is also known as [[Call Admission Control]] (CAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/solutions_docs/voip_solutions/CAC.html#wp902188 VoIP Call Admission Control] at Cisco&lt;/ref&gt;

An application that wishes to use a [[connection-oriented]] network to transport traffic must first request a connection (through signalling, for example [[Q.2931]]), which involves informing the network about the characteristics of the traffic and the [[quality of service]] (QoS) required by the application.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson P., Huston G., Quality of Service: Delivering QoS on the Internet and in Corporate Networks, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1998. {{ISBN|0-471-24358-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is matched against a traffic contract. If the connection request is accepted, the application is permitted to use the network to transport traffic.

This function protects the network resources from malicious connections and enforces the compliance of every connection to its negotiated traffic contract.

Difference between CAC and traffic policing is that CAC is an ''a priori'' verification (before the transfer occurs), while traffic policing is an ''a posteriori'' verification (during the transfer).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kf1ZwDifdAC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=urmonotheism |title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|page=136|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|year=1997|isbn=1-85075-657-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=YmgCAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Urreligion&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 J L Studach ''Die Urreligion oder das entdeckte Uralphabet'', 1856]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;
