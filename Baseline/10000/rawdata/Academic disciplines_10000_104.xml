      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12579">Formerly called the '''Intern Development Program''' ('''IDP'''), the '''Architectural Experience Program''' ('''AXP''') is a comprehensive training program created to ensure that candidates pursuing licensure in the architecture profession gain the knowledge and skills required for the independent practice of architecture. The program is developed, maintained, and administered by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) and is required by most U.S. architectural registration boards to satisfy experience requirements for licensure.

==History==
In 1976, NCARB introduced the Intern Development Program (IDP) after working with the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) throughout the 1970s to develop a more structured program for candidates to ensure they were gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to practice independently. Administered by NCARB, jurisdictions gradually began adopting the program to satisfy their experience requirement.

Mississippi became the first state to require the IDP in 1978. All 54 U.S. jurisdictions accept the IDP toward the fulfillment of their experience requirement.

The first major change to the program came in 1996 when it became required to record actual training units earned rather than the percent of time spent in each training area. The program has been monitored annually by NCARB’s Internship Committee, which has recommended other minor changes over the years based on interpretations of the current practice of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-2/IDP2-History.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, NCARB announced the rollout of IDP 2.0, the most significant update to the program since its inception in the 1970s. IDP 2.0 more closely aligns the program's requirements with the current practice of architecture and ensures the comprehensive training that is essential for competent practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-2/IDP2-Timeline.aspx IDP 2.0 Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

IDP 2.0 was developed in response to the 2007 Practice Analysis of Architecture. In this study, almost 10,000 practicing architects completed an extensive electronic survey to identify the tasks, knowledge, and skills that recently licensed architects, practicing independently, need in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

The updates were rolled out in phases with the first phase occurring in July 2009 and the final in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2011/10-IDP-2.aspx Final Phase of IDP 2.0 to be Implemented April 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224836/http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2011/10-IDP-2.aspx |date=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the IDP was [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx streamlined] to reduce experience hours required from 5,600 to 3,740. (Some jurisdictions require documentation of additional hours to meet their experience requirement. NCARB recommends that you submit all experience until you have satisfied your jurisdiction’s requirement. See individual jurisdiction’s requirements [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas/Experience-Requirement-by-State.aspx '''here'''].)

In order to address the findings of the 2012 Practice Analysis, NCARB began an in-depth review and overhaul of the experience program to ensure that the requirements continued to adhere to current architectural practice. In addition, NCARB decided to rename the IDP the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) as part of an effort to sunset the term “intern.”

The introduction of the new name and the overhaul were both launched on June 29, 2016. In the AXP, the previous 17 experience categories were realigned into six broad areas that reflect the current practice of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2016/AXP-Launch.aspx|title=NCARB Launches Architectural Experience Program|last=|first=|date=2016-06-30|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703160133/http://www.ncarb.org/News-and-Events/News/2016/AXP-Launch.aspx|archivedate=2016-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
An individual seeking architectural licensure is referred to as an '''“licensure candidate.”''' All U.S. states and Canadian provinces prohibit the use of the word “architect” from any person not already licensed to practice architecture. Most states and provinces also prohibit any derivation of the word architect as well.

A '''supervisor''' is someone who reviews and directs the work of others and ensures that work is done within acceptable levels of quality. An AXP supervisor is the individual who supervises a candidate on a daily basis. The AXP supervisor is required to certify that the information submitted on an experience report is true and correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Supervisors-and-Mentors/Working-With-A-Supervisor.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mentor''' is a loyal adviser, teacher, or coach. An AXP mentor must be a registered architect who makes a long-term commitment to a candidate’s professional growth. If possible, the mentor should not work in the same office so that the candidate can gain useful insight into the daily work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Supervisors-and-Mentors/Working-With-A-Mentor.aspx|title=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The first step to beginning the AXP is to establish an [http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Getting-Started/My-NCARB-Record.aspx NCARB Record]. Candidates are eligible to start earning credit for the AXP once they have graduated from high school. In order to gain experience, they must work under the direct supervision of an AXP supervisor in one of the NCARB approved work settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Meeting-NCARB-Experience-Requirements/Work-Settings.aspx|title=IDP Work Settings|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031417/http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Meeting-NCARB-Experience-Requirements/Work-Settings.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All experience must be reported electronically to NCARB at least every six months through their NCARB Record, and experience may be submitted more often. Half credit will be given for experience reported that is up to five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/Maintaining-Participation.aspx|title=Maintaining Participation|website=www.ncarb.org|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience requirement==
Licensure candidates must acquire 3,740 experience hours in specific experience areas to complete the AXP. These areas were effective June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx|title=Experience Requirements|last=|first=|date=2016-06-29|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensure candidates must be employed in one of two experience settings to earn credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Categories-Areas.aspx|title=Experience Requirements|last=|first=|date=2016-06-29|website=NCARB|publisher=NCARB|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice Management===
'''Required hours: 160'''

Practice Management is where licensure candidates gain experience running an architecture firm—including the ins and outs of managing a business, marketing firms, securing projects, working with clients, and sustaining a positive and professional work environment.

===Project Management===
'''Required hours: 360'''

In Project Management, licensure candidates learn how to deliver projects that meet contractual requirements, so they’ll be prepared to budget, coordinate, oversee, and execute a project.

=== Programming &amp; Analysis ===
'''Required hours: 260'''

Programming &amp; Analysis is the first phase of a project, often referred to as pre-design. Licensure candidates will experience tasks related to researching and evaluating client requirements, building code and zoning regulations, and site data to develop recommendations on the feasibility of a project.

=== Project Planning &amp; Design ===
'''Required hours: 1,080'''

Project Planning &amp; Design covers the schematic design phase of a project. Licensure candidates will learn to layout the building design, review building codes and regulations, coordinate schematics with consultants, and communicate design concepts with clients.

=== Project Development &amp; Documentation ===
'''Required hours: 1,520'''

In Project Development &amp; Documentation, licensure candidates will gain experience with projects after the schematic design has been approved—focusing on construction documents and coordinating with regulatory authorities to gain the necessary approvals for construction.

=== Construction &amp; Evaluation ===
'''Required hours: 360'''

In Construction &amp; Evaluation, licensure candidates will get involved with the construction administration and post-construction phases of a project—this includes being out on the job site; meeting with contractors, clients, and building officials; and punching lists, leading to the completion of the project.

===Total hours: 3,740===

==Resources==
'''''AXP Guidelines'':''' Produced by NCARB, the document is essential reading for participants of the AXP. It includes steps to completing the program, reporting procedures, training requirements, and core competencies that should understand before becoming licensed. The document is updated about twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/forms/idp_guidelines.pdf |title=IDP Guidelines |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106003738/http://www.ncarb.org/forms/idp_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP-Coordinators.aspx '''Architect Licensing Advisor''']''':''' An individual who provides information and guidance for those working toward licensure. Licensing advisors are usual located at:
* NAAB-accredited architectural degree programs
* AIA chapters
* AIAS chapters
* Firms
* State registration boards

{{Infobox Observatory}}
'''Armagh Observatory''' is an astronomical research institute in [[Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Around 25 astronomers are based at the observatory, studying stellar astrophysics, the [[Sun]], [[Solar System]] astronomy and  Earth's [[climate]].

==History==
The Observatory is located close to the centre of the city of Armagh, adjacent to the [[Armagh Planetarium]] in approximately {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of landscaped grounds known as the Armagh Astropark. It was founded in 1789 by [[The Most Reverend|The Most Rev.]] and [[Right Honourable|Rt Hon.]] [[Richard Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby|The 1st Baron Rokeby]], [[Church of Ireland]] [[Primate of All Ireland|Lord Primate of All Ireland]] and [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Lord Archbishop of Armagh]].

[[Ernst Julius Öpik]] (grandfather of [[Lembit Öpik]] MP) was based here for over 30 years and among his many contributions to astrophysics he wrote of the dangers of an asteroid impacting on the Earth.

==Facilities==
There are scale models of the Solar System and the Universe, two sundials and historic telescopes, as well as telescope domes and other outdoor exhibits. The Human Orrery, launched in 2004, is located close to the main Observatory building. The Observatory's specialist library and archives, and collections of scientific instruments and artefacts associated with the development of modern astronomy, represent one of the leading collections of its kind in the [[British Isles]].

'''Autonomous Telepresence''' (or AT) is a term coined by Marque Cornblatt to describe an emerging field of study that combines [[robotics]], [[social networking]] and human interaction. These elements together enable an entirely new and unique form of two-way communication - remotely operated face-to-face video chat. Using off-the-shelf components, Gomi and found objects, AT was first developed and built by Cornblatt in 1993 in the Sparky series of rovers (also known as the Self Portrait Artifact - Roving Chassis series).

Combining the real-time interaction commonly associated with web-based [[video chat]] with the independence of a remotely operated vehicle, AT has become a novel method for human interaction, helping connect people in schools, museums, corporate environment and events.

By the late 1990s the Sparky series had grown to include a wide range of technologies to enable [[face-to-face interaction]], These include the development of unique software and code, as well as the inclusion of Internet, Wi-Fi, and other technologies.  AT was featured at the 2007 [[Interactive Television of Tomorrow]] show, as well as the [[American Film Institute]] Digital Content Festival the same year.  AT and Sparky were recently showcased on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s [[Modern Marvels]] program as the future of the telephone.

A '''Bachelor of Education''' (B.Ed.) is a [[bachelor's degree|graduate]] [[professional degree]] which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools, though in some countries additional work must be done in order for the student to be fully qualified to teach.

==USA and Canada==
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a program lasting one to five years, depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located. In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.

A B.Ed. program may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor's degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor's degree, usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.

There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction. In the [[United States]], this includes [[elementary school]] education, [[middle school]] education, and [[high school]] education. Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] degree. In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specializes in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state's Board of Education certification examination.

A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in [[pedagogy]], educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.

==Australia==
In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student's intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.
The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor's degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.

Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.

==Bangladesh==
In [[Bangladesh]], Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons. (4 years) and Diploma (1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or Colleges for those aimed their profession as a Teacher or as an Education and Curriculum Specialist or as an Educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as [[Save the Children]], [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level. Without teaching profession, if anyone wants to go other professions such as education &amp; curriculum specialist, researcher, administrator etc. in any educational or other sectors, he/she must have the minimum qualification of Hons. graduation degree in Education (B.Ed. hons. degree). Every year many talent Hons. graduate students from this subject get international scholarship from well known universities of other countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|USA]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] etc. The minimum qualification required for entry into '''B.Ed. Hons. (4 years)''' course is passed H.S.C or Equivalent and for entry into Diploma (1/2/3 years) course in education is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc). The Hons. students of this subject have to read basic educational course contents as their major courses with some minor subject courses. In addition, usually for diploma (1/2/3 years) students from Arts faculty are trained to lecture subjects like history, civics, geography and languages and from Science faculty are trained to follow their lecture on mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology etc. whereas graduates from Commerce faculty trained up to lecture on accounting &amp; finance, economics, management &amp; marketing. After B.Ed. hons., one can continue for Master in Education (M.Ed.), M.Phil, PhD.D in Education in some universities of Bangladesh. National Council for Education and related Universities as well as their institutions is the constitutional authority to standardize courses for the educationalist and teachers in Bangladesh.

Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or an Undergraduate/Bachelor's Degree in one or two subject areas, with a Diploma of Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Diploma of Education.

== Nigeria ==
In [[Nigeria]], the Bachelor of Education degree is awarded at Universities and Colleges of Education across the nation as a first degree. There are a few specialised Universities of Education in the country that exist to train teachers professionally. Some of these specialised Universities include [[Tai Solarin University of Education]] and [[Ignatius Ajuru University of Education]]. The B.Ed can be done as combined honours with a B.A. or B.Sc. It can also be done as a single honours degree with specialisations in Nursery and Primary Education, Curriculum Development, Educational Administration and Policy Studies, among others.

Upon graduation, they are registered by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and can be employed as teachers afterwards. Postgraduate education usually take the form of an [[Master of Education|M.Ed]], PGDE, and GDE.

==Sri Lanka==
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the [[University of Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) in 1963. Prof. J. E. Jayasuriya, then Professor of Education at University of Ceylon introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications. Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor's degree either in Arts or Sciences and after four years of teaching in a Secondary school teachers get the One year Post-Graduate Diploma in Education.

The University of Ceylon used to take only 50 -60 Post Graduate Diploma candidates at a time in an annual program. The B.Ed. degree was introduced combining the bachelor's degree and the Post Graduate Diploma in Education. B.Ed. was introduced as a four-year special degree and in contrast with the 9 - 10 3hr papers at the final degree examination, a B.Ed. degree required a candidates to sit for 19 - 20 papers for the finals. This happened due to combining of the bachelor's degree and the Post-graduate Diploma in Education. Only the top performing students were admitted to B.Ed. degree at University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. The first batch graduated in 1967. Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed. degree. Upali M Sedere was the first First Class holder of the B.Ed. degree from University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1969. Subsequently, in 1973, the B.Ed. program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], where both the [[university]] system and [[school]] system are very different, the degree is awarded after a three or four-year course (the course length depends on the university) which is specifically tailored to either [[primary education]] or for a limited range of [[secondary education]] subjects. It leads to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS) in England and Wales and is a [[teaching qualification]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result of the [[Robbins Report|Robbins Report on higher education (1963)]], the teacher training colleges were reformed as [[College of education|Colleges of Education]]. Such colleges, as in the case of those in London, became 'constituent colleges' of the [[Institute of Education]], with their academic award being from the [[University of London]]. Students were offered an extra year of study, bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree. The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm.org.uk/mt/archive/mt196files/ATM-MT196-03-07.pdf atm.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s, when a [[bachelor's degree]] became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the old [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed).

The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification. Other routes are as follows:

==Bachelor of Science Education (B.Sc.Ed.)==
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in biology, chemistry, physics, and math) with major Educational courses. It is the combination of degrees in science and education course (sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc + B.Ed. = B.Sc.Ed.). Even though B.Sc and B.Ed. are notionally two degrees, they must be taken together. There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty/School of Science and that of Education, to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science.

In Malaysia, it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into. Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test, rigorous interviews and demos of teaching. Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education. Upon graduation, the students will get job offers from government and private institutions (mostly to teach for matriculation, foundation or high school students) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training. Graduates also can work in other science related industries. Bachelor of Science ''and'' Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science ''in'' Education.

In Singapore, the [[National Institute of Education]], an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University, offers a four-year undergraduate programme, offering B.Sc.(Ed.) or B.A.(Ed.) in its initial teacher training programmes. Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles, alongside their chosen subject majors (and minors).

It was edited by Johan Kugelberg with Philippe Vermés and published in the United Kingdom by Four Corners Books in 2011.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/beauty-is-in-the-street-2291269.html|title=Beauty is in the Street|date=31 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Matilda|last=Battersby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Paris July 1968.jpg|thumb|Posters in Paris in July 1968]]

The ''Atelier Populaire'', who designed and printed the posters, were a group of [[Marxist]] artists and art students who occupied the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] during with the wave of [[wildcat strikes]] in May 1968.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; Using a [[silk-screen]] printing press they produced thousands of posters at a time.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; They typically were printed on newssheet using a single colour, and use a simple [[iconography]] in which the factory represents the role of workers in society and the fist stands for solidarity and resistance (see right).&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

They comment on topics including the [[freedom of the press]] (see also [[Censorship in France]]), [[colonialism]] (see also [[French colonial empire]]) and the status of [[immigrant workers]] (see also [[Immigration to France]]).&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; The posters were also used to voice opposition to [[consumerism]] and were inspired by the [[Situationist International]]'s critique of the [[spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]] and [[Georges Perec]]'s 1965 novel ''[[Things: A Story of the Sixties]].&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Though the posters display various styles, individual artists were never credited and each work was treated as the work of the collective.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; General assemblies (see [[General assembly (Occupy movement)]]) were held to discuss and vote on the posters.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/01/1968-paris-protest-posters-.html|title='Beauty Is in the Street' features 1968 Paris protest posters|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Liesl|last=Bradner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; In a 1969 book of the posters, the ''Atelier Populaire'' wrote "To use them for decorative purposes, to display them in bourgeois places of culture or to consider them as objects of aesthetic interest is to impair both their function and their effect."&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Much of the imagery they created, including a poster of a truncheon-wielding [[riot police]]man (right) has since achieved iconic status.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; The posters were rarely saved but were collected by Kugelberg who staged an exhibition at London's [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; The exhibition commemorated the 40th anniversary of the protests.&lt;ref name=dd/&gt;

==Overview==

The book includes over 200 posters.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/four-corners-beauty-in-the-street|title=Four Corners: Beauty is in the Street|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=It's Nice That|first=Alex|last=Bec}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the exhibition which preceded it, the posters in the book are accompanied by photographs taken by Vermés of the students, the production process and the protests,&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; many of which were previously unpublished.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

The book also includes a foreword by Vermés, a founder of the ''Atelier Populaire'';&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; translations of first-hand accounts of students' and strikers' clashes with the police;&lt;ref name=int/&gt; manifestos and pamphlets;&lt;ref name=dd/&gt; a pictorial index, a bibliography, and a thumbnail gallery of posters that were not reproduced full-size.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Justin McGuirk noted the continued relevance of "the spirit of '68" in the United Kingdom in the wake of the [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|2010 student protests]], describing the book as "a beautiful volume". McGuirk questioned the absence of political design from the 2010 protests and occupations, as well as the commercial [[street art]] of [[Banksy]] and [[Shepard Fairey]], and the contemporary popularity of the 1939 [[Keep Calm and Carry On]] poster.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/23/beauty-in-street-posters-protest|title=Beauty Is in the Street: the power of protest posters|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Justin|last=McGuirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Liesl Bradner also argued for the book's relevance in 2012 after the [[Occupy movement]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s naming "the protester" as its [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Alex Bec of the art blog ''It's Nice That'' noted that despite the events of May 1968 having been well documented, "''Beauty is in the Street'' blew everything before it out of the water."&lt;ref name=int/&gt; Fíacha O'Dubhda of ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]'' described the book as one "that immerses the reader in the process through which spontaneous design and production were used to document, illustrate and instigate" the events of May 1968.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/review/article/on-the-barricades|title=On the barricades|date=Summer 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]|first=Fíacha|last=O'Dubhda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[theological]] usages, the term appears as ''[[charism]]'', with a meaning the same as sense 2.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the term has become widely{{quantify|date=July 2017}} used, with varying meanings, in religion, the [[Social science|social sciences]], the [[biological sciences]], the media, and throughout Western societies.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Since the advent of [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] in 1974, the word charisma has also been used as an attribute in gaming, where it designates a character's likeability and their ability to persuade.

==Etymology==
The English term ''charisma'' is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} (''khárisma''), which means "favor freely given" or "gift of grace".&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; The term and its plural {{lang|grc|χαρίσματα}} (''charismata'') derive from {{lang|grc|χάρις}} (''charis''), which means "grace". Some derivatives from that root (including "grace") have similar meanings to the modern sense of ''personality charisma'', such as "filled with attractiveness or charm", "kindness", "to bestow a favor or service", or "to be favored or blessed".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"charisma" in ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' second edition. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, Robert. ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek''. Brill, 2010, p. 1607.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Koine Greek|ancient Greek dialect]] widely used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] employed these terms without the connotations found in modern religious usage.&lt;ref name=Ebertz&gt;Ebertz, Michael N. "Charisma" in ''Religion Past &amp; Present.'' edited by Hans Dieter Betz, et al., Brill, 2007, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek]]s applied personality charisma to their [[Greek mythology|gods]]; for example, attributing charm, beauty, nature, human creativity or fertility to goddesses they called ''[[Charites]]'' ({{lang|grc|Χάριτες}}).

Theologians and social scientists have expanded and modified the original Greek meaning into the two distinct senses above. For ease of reference, we will call the first sense ''personality charisma'' and the second ''divinely conferred charisma''.

The meaning of ''charisma'' has become greatly diffused from its original ''divinely conferred'' meaning, and even from the ''personality charisma'' meaning in modern English dictionaries, which reduces to a mixture of charm and status. John Potts, who has extensively analyzed the term's history, sums up meanings beneath this diffused common usage:&lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary charisma maintains, however, the irreducible character ascribed to it by Weber: it retains a mysterious, elusive quality. Media commentators regularly describe charisma as the "X-factor". …The enigmatic character of charisma also suggests a connection – at least to some degree – to the earliest manifestations of charisma as a spiritual gift.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. A History of Charisma. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Divinely conferred charisma===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] record the development of ''divinely conferred charisma''. In the Hebrew text the idea of charismatic leadership is generally signaled by the use of the noun ''hen'' (favor) or the verb ''hanan'' (to show favor). The Greek term for ''charisma'' (grace or favor), and its root ''charis'' (grace) replaced the Hebrew terms in the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the 3rd century BC [[Koine Greek#Biblical Koine|Septuagint]]). Throughout, "the paradigmatic image of the charismatic hero is the figure who has received God's favor".&lt;ref name = Scheper&gt;Scheper, George L. "Charisma" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones. Macmillan Reference USA, 2005, v 3, p. 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''divinely conferred charisma''&lt;ref&gt;Grabo, A., Spisak, B. R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2017). Charisma as signal: An evolutionary perspective on charismatic leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 28(4), 473-485. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.&lt;/ref&gt; applied to highly revered figures.

Thus, Eastern Mediterranean Jews in the 1st century CE had notions of ''charis'' and ''charisma'' that embraced the range of meanings found in Greek culture and the spiritual meanings from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. ''A History of Charisma''. PalgraveMacMillan, 2009, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; From this linguistic legacy of fused cultures, in [[1 Corinthians]], [[Paul the Apostle]] introduced the meaning that the Holy Spirit bestowed ''charism'' and ''charismata'', "the gift of God's grace", upon individuals or groups. For Paul, "[t]here is a clear distinction between charisma and charis; charisma is the direct result of divine charis or grace".&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1549&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s, Paul refers to ''charisma'' or its plural ''charismata'' seven times in [[1 Corinthians]], written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]] (or common) Greek around 54 CE. He elaborates on his concepts with six references in Romans (c. 56). He makes 3 individual references in [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 56), [[1 Timothy]], and [[2 Timothy]] (c. 62 – c. 67). The seventeenth and only other mention of ''charisma'' is in 1 Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3), pp. 268-269. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebertz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 23, 37, 43, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia''. Thomson/Gale, 2003, v. 3, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gospel]]s, written in the late first century, apply ''divinely conferred charisma'' to revered figures. Examples are accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and of his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], in which disciples see him as radiant with light, appearing together with Moses and Elijah. Another example is [[Gabriel|Gabriel's]] greeting to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as "full of grace".&lt;ref  name=Scheper/&gt; In these and other instances [[early Christians]] designated certain individuals as possessing "spiritual gifts", and these gifts included "the ability to penetrate the neighbour to the bottom of his heart and spirit and to recognize whether he is dominated by a good or by an evil spirit and the gift to help him to freedom from his demon".&lt;ref name=Benz&gt;Benz, Ernst Wilhelm. "The Roles of Christianity" in ''The new Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 16, 1986, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers characterized their revered religious figures as having "a higher perfection… a special ''Charisma''".&lt;ref name=Benz/&gt; Then, with the establishment of the [[Christian Church]], "the old charismatic gifts and free offerings were transformed into a hierarchical sacerdotal system".&lt;ref&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches'', translated by Olive Wyon. Allen and Unwin, v. 1, 1911/1931, pp. 99, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the institution rather than divinely inspired individuals increasingly dominated religious thought and life, and that focus went unchanged for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, William and Mary Morse. ''Harper's Dictionary of Contemporary Usage''. Harper and Row, 1985, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional changes began in the 17th century when church leaders, notably in the [[Western Christianity|Latin tradition]], accented "individual gifts [and] particular talents imparted by [[God in Christianity|God]] or the [[Holy Spirit]]". The 19th century brought an increasing shift in emphasis toward individual and spiritual aspects of charisma; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and some [[Catholic]] [[Theology|theologians]] narrowed the concept to superlative, out-of-the-ordinary, and virtuoso gifts. Simultaneously, the term became alienated from the much wider meaning that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] had attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, 2007, pp. 493–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the narrowed term projected back to the earlier period "A systematically reflected and highly differentiated understanding of charisma was often unconsciously infused into the Scriptures and writings of the church fathers, so that these texts were no longer read through the eyes of the authors".&lt;ref&gt;Baumert, N. "'Charisma' – Versuch einer Sprachregelung." ''ThPh'' 66, 1991, p. 22. Quoted in Ebertz, 2007, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

These dialectic meanings influenced notable changes in [[Pentecostalism]] in the late 19th century, and [[charismatic movements]] in some mainline churches in the mid-20th century. The discussion in the [[#21st century religion|21st Century Religion]] section explores what ''charisma'' means in these and other religious groups.

===Personality charisma===
The basis for modern secular usage comes from [[Germans|German]] [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. He discovered the term in the work of [[Rudolph Sohm]], a [[Germans|German]] [[church historian]] whose 1892 ''Kirchenrecht''&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Rudolf. ''Kirchenrecht''. Leipzig: Duncher &amp; Humblot, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 269-270. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars, which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Norman. "Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace," ''Sociological Inquiry'', 68:1 pp. 32–60, 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate and literature had made ''charisma'' a popular term when Weber used it in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and in his [[Sociology of Religion (book)|''Sociology of Religion'']]. Perhaps because he assumed that readers already understood the idea, Weber's early writings lacked definition or explanation of the concept.  In the collection of his works, ''Economy and Society'' edited by his wife, he identified the term as a prime example of action he labeled "value-rational," in distinction from and opposition to action he labeled "Instrumentally rational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher= Bedminster Press|year=1968|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he applied meanings for ''charisma'' similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1544.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's ''charisma'' would have coincided with the ''divinely conferred charisma'' sense defined above in Sohm's work.

Weber introduced the ''personality charisma'' sense when he applied ''charisma'' to designate a form of authority. To explain [[charismatic authority]] he developed his classic definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organization'', translated by A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. Free Press, 1924/1947, pp. 328, 358ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Weber extends the concept of charisma beyond supernatural to superhuman and even to exceptional powers and qualities. Sociologist Paul Joosse examined Weber's famous definition, and found that:&lt;blockquote&gt;through simple yet profoundly consequential phrases such as “are considered” and “is treated,” charisma becomes a relational, attributable, and at last a properly sociological concept.... For Weber, the locus of power is in the led, who actively (if perhaps unconsciously) invest their leaders with social authority.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) pp.271. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Weber indicates that it is followers who attribute the individual with powers, emphasizing that "the recognition on the part of those subject to authority" is decisive for the validity of charisma.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1947, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber died in 1920 leaving "disordered, fragmentary manuscripts without even the guidance of a plan or table of the proposed contents". One unfinished manuscript contained his above quoted definition of ''charisma''.&lt;ref name=MacRae&gt;MacRae, Donald G. ''Max Weber''. Viking, 1974, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over a quarter century for his work to be translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;"Max Weber" in ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', edited by Craig Calhoun. Oxford University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to charisma, Weber's formulations are generally regarded as having revived the concept from its deep theological obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Stephen. "Charisma Reconsidered," pp. 5–26 in ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', 3:5, 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the admirable translations and prefaces of his entire works, many scholars have found Weber's formulations ambiguous. For the past half-century they have debated the meaning of many Weberian concepts, including the meaning of ''charisma,'' the role of followers, and the degree of a supernatural component.&lt;ref name=MacRae/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Sonja M. 1984. "The Role of Leadership in the Construction of Reality," pp. 157–178 in ''Leadership Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by Barbara Kellerman. Prentice-Hall, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. "Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the Symbolics of Power," in ''Culture and Its Creators'' edited by Ben-David J. Clark. University of Chicago Press, pp. 150–171, 1977, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, Peter. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rustow, Dankwart A. "The Study of Leadership."

Berghahn Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists have been most active in applying Weber's ideas, researchers in management and organizational behavior including [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues, have reignited interest in charisma with respect to defining the term in unambiguous ways, finding ways to experimentally manipulate charisma, and to estimate the causal effects of charisma on performance outcomes in work and political settings.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacquart, P. &amp; Antonakis, J. 2015.

== Rationale for civic education in the United States ==

The promotion of a republic and its values has been an important concern for policy-makers – to impact people´s political perceptions, to encourage political participation, and to foster the principles enshrined in the Constitution (e.g. liberty, freedom of speech, civil rights). The subject of “Civics” has been integrated into the Curriculum and Content Standards, to enhance the comprehension of democratic values in the educational system. Civic literature has found that “engaging young children in civic activities from an early age is a positive predictor of their participation in later civic life”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"&gt;Bers, Marina Umaschi. (2008). “Civic Identities, Online Technologies: From Designing Civic Curriculum to Supporting Civic Experiences." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp. 139–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an academic subject, Civics has the instructional objective to promote knowledge that is aligned with self-governance and participation in matters of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen C. Lagemann &amp; Harry R. Lewis. (2012). “Renewing Civic Education: Time to Restore American Higher Education's Lost Mission” (Harvard Magazine, March-Apr).&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives advocate for an instruction that encourages active student participation in democratic decision-making environments, such as voting to elect a course representative for a school government, or deciding on actions that will affect the school environment or community. Thus the intersection of individual and collective decision making activities, are critical to shape “individual´s moral development”.&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; To reach those goals, civic instructors must promote the adoption of certain skills and attitudes such as “respectful argumentation, debate, information literacy”, to support “the development of morally responsible individuals who will shape a morally responsible and civically minded society".&lt;ref name="Bers, Marina Umaschi 2008 pp.139"/&gt; In the 21st century, young people are less interested in direct political participation (i.e. being in a political party or even voting), but are motivated to use digital media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Digital media enable young people to share and exchange ideas rapidly, enabling the coordination of local communities that promote volunteerism and political activism, in topics principally related to human rights and  environmental subjects.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"&gt;Bennett, W. Lance. (2008). “Changing Citizenship in the Digital Age." ''Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth''. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008, pp.1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people are constructing and supporting their political identities in the 21st century by using social media, and digital tools (e.g. text messaging, hashtags, videos) to share, post, reply an opinion or attitude about a political/social topic and to promote social mobilization and support through online mechanism to a wide and diverse audience. Therefore, civics' end-goal in the 21st century must be oriented to “empower the learners to find issues in their immediate communities that seem important to the people with whom they live and associate”, once “learners have identified with a personal issue and participated in constructing a collective framing for common issues”.&lt;ref name="Bennett, W. Lance 2008 pp.1"/&gt;

== Current state of civic education in the United States ==

According to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, one of the purposes of Civic Education is to “foster civic competence and responsibility”  which is promoted through the Center for Civic Education’s We the People and Project Citizen initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-110, § 115, Stat. 1425 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is a lack of consensus for how this mission should be pursued.  The Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning &amp; Engagement (CIRCLE) reviewed state civic education requirements in the United States for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Godsay, S., Henderson, W., Levine, P., Littenberg-Tobias, J., &amp; CIRCLE (The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and, E). (2012). State Civic Education Requirements. CIRCLE Fact Sheet. Center For Information And Research On Civic Learning And Engagement (CIRCLE).&lt;/ref&gt;  The findings include:
* All 50 states have social studies standards which include civics and government.
* 40 states require at least one course in government/civics.
* 21 states require a state-mandated social studies test which is a decrease from 2001 (34 states).
* 8 states require students to take a state-mandated government/civics test.
* 9 states require a social studies test as a requirement for high school graduation.
The lack of state-mandated student accountability relating to civics may be a result of a shift in emphasis towards reading and mathematics in response to the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Nora. (2011) "Few States Test Students on Civics." ''Education Week, 32 (08).''  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/10/11/08civics.h32.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is a movement to require that states utilize the citizenship test as a graduation requirement, but this is seen as a controversial solution to some educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://civiceducator.org/tests-wont-fix-civics-education/|title=Hey Policy Makers! Tests Are Not the Answer for Better Civics Education|date=2017-09-13|work=The Civic Educator|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students are also demonstrating that their civic knowledge leaves much to be desired.  A National Center for Education Statistics NAEP report card for civics (2010) stated that “levels of civic knowledge in U.S. have remained unchanged or even declined over the past century”. Specifically, only 24 percent of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders were at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress in civics.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics (2011). The Nation’s Report Card: Civics 2010 (NCES 2011–466). Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, civic education has emphasized the facts of government processes detached from participatory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, A. (2015). Citizenship education in American schools and its role in developing civic engagement: a review of the research.Educational Review, 67(1), 35–63. {{doi|10.1080/00131911.2013.813440}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an effort to combat the existing approach, the National Council for the Social Studies developed the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards.  The C3 Framework emphasizes “new and active approaches” including the “discussion of controversial issues and current events, deliberation of public issues, service-learning, action civics, participation in simulation and role play, and the use of digital technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS).

== Civic education in the United States in the 21st century ==

According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, among teens 12–17 years old, 95% have access to the Internet, 70% go online daily, 80% use social networking sites, and 77% have cell phones.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"&gt;Jenkins, H. (2007). "Confronting the challenges of participatory culture: Media education for the 21st century." Chicago: The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, participatory culture has become a staple for today’s youth, affecting their conceptualization of civic participation.  They use Web 2.0 tools (i.e. blogs, podcasts, wikis, social media) to: circulate information (blogs and podcasts); collaborate with peers (wikis); produce and exchange media; and connect with people around the world via social media and online communities.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Lenhart, Mary Madden, Aaron Smith, Kristen Purcell, Kathryn Zickuhr and Lee Rainie, Teens, Kindness and Cruelty on Social Network Sites: How American teens navigate the new world of “digital citizenship” (Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, November 2011),&lt;nowiki&gt;http://pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2011/PIP_Teens_Kindness_Cruelty_SNS_Report_Nov_2011_FINAL_110711.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed on October 8, 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt;  The pervasiveness of participatory digital tools has led to a shift in the way adolescents today perceive civic action and participation. Whereas 20th century civic education embraced the belief of “dutiful citizenship” and civic engagement as a “matter of duty or obligation;” 21st century civic education has shifted to reflect youths' “personally expressive politics” and “peer-to-peer relationships” that promote civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Jenkins, H. 2007"/&gt;

This shift in students' perceptions has led to classroom civic education experiences that reflect the digital world in which 21st century youth now live, in order to make the content both relevant and meaningful.  Civics education classrooms in the 21st century now seek to provide genuine opportunities to actively engage in the consumption, circulation, discussion, and production of civic and political content via Web 2.0 technologies such as blogging, wikis, and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Don Tapscott, ''Growing up digital: The rise of the net generation'' ( New York: McGraw-Hill, 1997); W. Lance Bennett, Deen Freelon and Chris Wells, “Changing Citizen Identity and the Rise of a Participatory Media Culture,” in Lonnie R. Sherrod, Judith Torney-Purta and Constance A. Flanagan (Eds.), ''Handbook of Research on Civic Engagement in Youth'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these tools offer new ways for engagement, interaction, and dialogue, educators have also recognized the need to teach youth how to interact both respectfully and productively with their peers and members of online communities.  As a result, many school districts have also begun adopting Media Literacy Frameworks for Engaged Citizenship as a pedagogical approach to prepare students for active participatory citizenship in today’s digital age.  This model includes critical analysis of digital media as well as a deep understanding of media literacy as a “collaborative and participatory movement that aims to empower individuals to have a voice and to use it.”&lt;ref&gt;All Together Now: Collaboration and Innovation for Youth Engagement: The Report of the Commission on Youth Voting and Civic Knowledge (Medford, MA: Center for Information &amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 2013),  www.civicyouth.org/about-circle/ commission-on-youth-voting-civic-knowledge/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mihailidis, P., &amp; Thevenin, B.

'''Co-cultural communication theory''' was built upon the frameworks of [[muted group theory]] and [[standpoint theory]]. The cornerstone of co-cultural communication theory is muted group theory as proposed in the mid 1970s by Shirley and [[Edwin Ardener]].  The Ardeners were [[cultural anthropologists]] who made the observation that most other cultural anthropologists practicing [[ethnography]] in the field were talking only to the leaders of the cultures, who were by and large adult males. The researchers would then use this data to represent the culture as a whole, leaving out the perspectives of women, children and other groups made voiceless by the cultural hierarchy (S. Ardener, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Shirley, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ardeners maintained that groups which function at the top of the society hierarchy determine to a great extent the dominant communication system of the entire society (E. Ardener, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Ardener, Edwin, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ardener's 1975 muted group theory also posited that dominant group members formulate a "communication system that support their perception of the world and conceptualized it as ''the'' appropriate language for the rest of society".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication faculty Stanback and Pearce (1981) referred to these non-dominant groups as "subordinate social groups".  They noted 4 ways in which the non-dominant groups tend to communicate with the dominant groups. They also asserted that "From the perspective of the dominant group, the behaviors in each form of [[communication]] are appropriate. However, the meaning of these behaviors to the members of the lower-statused  group are quite different, making them different forms of communication with different implications for the relations among the groups".&lt;ref&gt;Stanback and Pearce, 1981, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of communication, Stanback and Pearce as well as Kramarae used muted group theory to help explain communication patterns and social representation of non-dominant cultural groups Kramarae (1981) believed that "those experiences unique to subordinate group members often cannot be effectively expressed within the confinements of the dominant communication system".&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, 1981, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that people within these groups create alternative forms of communication to articulate their experiences. Although, Kramarae used muted group theory to communications strategies of women she suggested that the framework can be applied with equal validity to a number of dominant/non-dominant relationships (Orbe, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramarae (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Kramarae, C., 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; presented three assumptions of muted group theory as applied to communication between men and women concluding that women traditionally have been muted by a male-dominated communications system. Additionally, Kramarae proposed seven hypotheses originating in muted group theory.
Standpoint theory was mainly used as a  [[feminist]] theoretical framework to explore experiences of women as they participate in and oppose their own subordination, however, (Smith, 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. E., 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the theory had applications for other subordinate groups. A basic tenet of [[standpoint theory]] is that it "seeks to include the experiences of subordinate groups within the process of research inquiry in meaningful ways".&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1998a, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, the members of the underrepresented groups become co-researchers.

==Theory==
The theory of co-cultural communication was introduced in 1996 by Mark Orbe, professor in the School of Communication at [[Western Michigan University]], when he found previously used names for the groups under consideration to have negative connotations. He cites previous studies which looked at the communication styles of different co-cultural groups which were referred to by a variety of terms.  Orbe was the first to refer to this type of work as "co-cultural communication theory".  Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, 1996, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; states, "in the past researchers have used a variety of terms to describe co-cultural communication: "intracultural" (Sitaram and Cogdell, 1976); "subordinate", "inferior", "minority" (Stanban and Pearce, 1981); "sub-cultural" (Pearson &amp; Nelson, 1991); (Folb, 1994); and "muted group" (Kramarae, 1981)."&lt;ref&gt;See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x87QW8Jybk&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbe combined the frameworks of muted group theory with that of standpoint theory to arrive at five fundamental concepts which describe co-cultural theory. Orbe&lt;ref&gt;Orbe,  1998b, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; states, "co-cultural theory seeks to uncover the commonalities among co-cultural group members as they function in dominant society while substantiating the vast diversity of experiences between and among groups."

==Application==
Since the introduction of co-cultural theory in "Laying the foundation for co-cultural communication theory: An inductive approach to studying "non-dominant" communication strategies and the factors that influence them" (1996), Orbe has published two works describing the theory and its use as well as several studies on communication patterns and strategies based on different co-cultural groups.

In Orbe's "A Co-cultural communication approach to intergroup relations" (1997), he provides an overview of co-cultural theory, including an explanation of the process by which co-cultural group members strategically select different communications styles.

Orbe (1998a) "Constructing co-cultural theory: an explication of culture, power, and communication", presents the theoretical framework for co-cultural theory including the development of the theory, clarification of the co-cultural communication process, and limitations and future directions for its use. Orbe (1998b) "From the standpoint(s) of traditionally muted groups: Explicating a co-cultural communication theoretical model", in which he designated 9 co-cultural orientations based on the intersections of three communication approaches: Non-assertive, Assertive, and Aggressive with 3 preferred outcomes: Separation, Accommodation and Assimilation.

In 2000, Orbe and C. M. Greer presented a paper: "Recognizing the diversity of lived experience: The utility of co-cultural theory in communication and disabilities research" at the annual meeting of the [[Central States Communication Association]], in [[Detroit]].  In 2001, Heuman presented "Multiracial/ethnic identity: A co-cultural approach" during the annual meeting of the Central States Communication Association in Cincinnati. During the same meeting Dixon presented "Naming issues in the future of [[intercultural communication]] research: The contributions of Mark Orbe's co-cultural theory".

Orbe (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M., 2004, pp. 191-211&lt;/ref&gt; used co-cultural theory as a foundation to explore the processes by which public dialogue can be facilitated across cultural boundaries. Orbe and Spellers (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Orbe, M. and Spellers, R. E.,2005, pp. 173-191&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in this book chapter on the origins of co-cultural theory from the perspectives of their different areas of research as well as point to implications for future work.

Orbe &amp; Lapinski (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Lapinski, M. K., &amp; Orbe, M., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; published the design of a self-report measure of the two components of co-cultural theory, preferred outcome and communication approach, and provides evidence from two studies for the [[construct validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the co-cultural theory scales (C-CTS).

Ramirez-Sanchez (2008) examines the possibility of applying co-cultural theory to co-cultural groups that are [[marginalized]] in a larger co-cultural context and to "offer a complex cultural context to which co-cultural theory can be applied and generate questions that could serve to enrich the analytical scope of co-cultural theory and its implications".&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez-Sanchez, 2008, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Camara and Orbe published the article "Analyzing Strategic Responses to Discriminatory Acts: A Co-Cultural Communicative Investigation" in the Journal of International and Intercultural Communication. Two authors utilized Orbe's (1998) co-cultural theory model of the 9 communication orientations and 26 communication practices to identify how co-cultural group members response to the acts of discrimination. Two authors used qualitative content analysis to code the participants’ stories. The paper also oriented the directions of future research.

In 2012, Jungmi Jun, an assistant professor of Department of Communication at Wayne State University, published her article "Why Are Asian Americans Silent? Asian Americans' Negotiation Strategies for Communicative Discriminations" in the ''Journal of International and Intercultural Communication''. The author utilized Orbe's co-cultural theory model to explore two questions. One is what types of racially discriminatory messages target Asian Americans; another one is what communicative approaches do Asian Americans apply to negotiate those messages. The paper used content analysis to code 176 stories gained through an online survey. The research found that Asian Americans tend to use nonassertive approaches to respond to racially discriminatory messages due to internal/environmental factors including emotional shock and humiliation, a lack of knowledge of proper responses, peer pressure, and strategic intent.

'''Coding House''' was a [[coding bootcamp]] in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]]. The 14-week-long bootcamp taught students [[JavaScript]] and other technologies. Founded in 2014 by Nicholas James, it was ordered shut down in November 2016 by the regulatory agency [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE) for violating [[law of California|California law]] many times. BPPE denied Coding House's licensing application three times and found that Coding House had engaged in [[false advertising]].

In September 2016, Coding House mandated that students sign non-disparagement contracts disallowing them from either publicly or privately criticizing the school. If Coding House determined that students had originated damaging information about it, Coding House vowed to take action against the students.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

===Shutdown===
The [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE), which is tasked with regulating California coding schools, declined to add Coding House to its list of approved programs.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt; It first warned Coding House in a [[cease and desist]] in January 2014 that it was unlicensed to operate as a coding bootcamp.&lt;ref name="2014-03-10"&gt;{{cite news |date=2014-03-10 |title=Editorial: California's coding-camp crackdown |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/california-604718-coding-camps.html |newspaper=[[Orange County Register]] |accessdate=2016-12-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6n6y8r4W5?url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/california-604718-coding-camps.html |archivedate=2016-12-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPPE rejected Coding House's applications in November 2015, in June 2016, and on November 4, 2016. On November 7, 2016, the BPPE levied a $50,000 fine on Coding House founder Nicholas James and mandated that James close the school. BPPE further decreed that Coding House reimburse every single student who had enrolled in the school. Coding House filed an appeal but discontinued classes in the meantime.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

BPPE shut the school down because it found Coding House had committed many contraventions of [[law of California|California law]].&lt;ref name="Marro2016-12-22"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marro |first=Enrico |date=2016-12-22 |title=Coding bootcamp, il sogno di un lavoro da 100mila euro |language=Italian |url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo/2016-12-21/coding-bootcamp-sogno-un-lavoro-100mila-euro-171600.shtml |newspaper=[[Il Sole 24 Ore]] |accessdate=2016-12-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6n6y9IT13?url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo/2016-12-21/coding-bootcamp-sogno-un-lavoro-100mila-euro-171600.shtml |archivedate=2016-12-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPPE determined that Coding House had engaged in [[false advertising]]. Coding House said on its website that 95% of its alumni received employment by two months after completing the curriculum and that their average starting salary was $91,000. However, BPPE found that just 57 of Coding House's 70 graduates had provided details about their jobs and salaries. The school had 21 companies in a "Where Our Graduates Work Now" part of its website. However, BPPE determined from an analysis of Coding House's records that just two alumni had been hired by either of the 21 companies. BPPE ruled that Coding House contravened home-occupation permit rules by functioning in residential neighborhoods. BPPE additionally found that at Coding House a male student had [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] a female student while people were drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">The '''Contemporary Physics Education Project''' (CPEP) is an "organization of teachers, educators, and physicists"&lt;ref name="website"&gt;http://www.cpepPhysics.org&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1987. The group grew out of the [[Academic conference|Conference]] on the Teaching of Modern [[Physics]] held at [[Fermilab]] in 1986, organized by the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Aubrecht, ed., ''Quarks, Quasars, and Quandaries: Proceedings of the Conference on the Teaching of Modern Physics'' (College Park, MD: American Association of Physics Teachers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first effort aimed to supply a chart for [[particle physics]] teaching that would rival the [[Periodic Table]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]]. The first version of this chart was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamental Particles and Interactions — A Wall Chart of Modern Physics'', Fundamental Particle and Interaction Chart Committee (W. Achor et al.), Phys. Teach. 26, 556 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

CPEP has created four charts emphasizing contemporary aspects of physics research: [[Elementary particle|particles]] and interactions; [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[plasma physics]]; [[nuclear science]]; and [[cosmology]]. Almost half a million of these charts and similar products have been distributed.

The group has created website support for teaching for each of the charts.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

CPEP received the 2017 "Excellence in Physics Education Award" from the American Physical Society, "for leadership in providing educational materials on contemporary physics topics to students for over 25 years."&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

Offshoots of CPEP include the book, "The Charm of Strange Quarks: Mysteries and Revolutions of Particle Physics" (2000), by R. Michael Barnett, Henry Muehry, and [[Helen R. Quinn]], three of the founders of CPEP. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnett |first1=R.

R. Michael Barnett described the formation and early days of CPEP in a Nobel Symposium Lecture in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/symposia/interdisciplinary/ns120/lectures/barnett.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corpus of Contemporary American English''' ('''COCA''') is a more than 560-million-word [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[American English]]. It was created by [[Mark Davies (linguist)|Mark Davies]], Professor of [[corpus linguistics|Corpus Linguistics]] at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/CoRD/corpora/COCA/background.html |title=The Corpus of Contemporary American English: Background and history |work=VARIENG |first=Henri |last=Kauhanen |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The corpus is composed of more than 560 million words from 220,225 texts, including 20 million words from each of the years 1990 through 2017. The most recent update was made in December 2017. The corpus is used by approximately tens of thousands of people each month,{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}} which may make it the most widely used "structured" corpus currently available.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=April 2018}}

For each year, the corpus is evenly divided between the following five genres: spoken, fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and academic journals. The texts come from a variety of sources:

* Spoken: (85 million words) Transcripts of unscripted conversation from nearly 150 different TV and radio programs.
* Fiction: (81 million words) Short stories and plays, first chapters of books 1990–present, and movie scripts.
* Popular magazines: (86 million words) Nearly 100 different magazines, from a range of domains such as news, health, home and gardening, women's, financial, religion, and sports.
* Newspapers: (81 million words) Ten newspapers from across the US, with text from different sections of the newspapers, such as local news, opinion, sports, and the financial section.
* Academic Journals: (81 million words) Nearly 100 different peer-reviewed journals. These were selected to cover the entire range of the [[Library of Congress Classification|Library of Congress Classification system]].

==Availability==

The corpus is free to search through its web interface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus of Contemporary American English|url=http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/|website=Corpus of Contemporary American English|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a limit on the number of queries per day, and less-restricted access is available at cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU corpora: Premium|url=http://corpus.byu.edu/premium.asp|website=BYU corpora|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The full corpus texts are available for a further fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus data: Purchase|url=http://www.corpusdata.org/purchase.asp|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Queries ==
* The interface is the same as the BYU-BNC interface for the 100 million word [[British National Corpus]], the 100 million word TIME Magazine corpus, and the 400 million word Corpus of *Historical* American English (COHA), 1810s–2000s (see links below)
* Queries by word, phrase, alternates, substring, part of speech, lemma, synonyms (see below), and customized lists (see below)
* The corpus is tagged by [[CLAWS (linguistics)|CLAWS]], the same [[part of speech]] tagger that was used for the BNC and the TIME corpus
* Chart listings (totals for all matching forms in each genre or year, 1990–present, as well as for subgenres) and table listings (frequency for each matching form in each genre or year)
* Full collocates searching (up to ten words left and right of node word)
* Re-sortable concordances, showing the most common words/strings to the left and right of the searched word
* Comparisons between genres or time periods (e.g. collocates of 'chair' in fiction or academic, nouns with 'break the [N]' in newspapers or academic, adjectives that occur primarily in sports magazines, or verbs that are more common 2005–2010 than previously)
* One-step comparisons of collocates of related words, to study semantic or cultural differences between words (e.g. comparison of collocates of 'small' and 'little', or 'Democrats' and 'Republicans', or 'men' and 'women', or 'rob' vs 'steal')
* Users can include semantic information from a 60,000 entry thesaurus directly as part of the query syntax (e.g. frequency and distribution of synonyms of 'beautiful', synonyms of 'strong' occurring in fiction but not academic, synonyms of 'clean' + noun ('clean the floor', 'washed the dishes'))
* Users can also create their own 'customized' word lists, and then re-use these as part of subsequent queries (e.g. lists related to a particular semantic category (clothes, foods, emotions), or a user-defined part of speech)
* Note that the corpus is only available through the web interface, due to copyright restrictions.

The '''East Pole–West Pole divide''' in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] is an intellectual schism between researchers subscribing to the [[psychological nativism|nativist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] schools of thought.  The term arose from the fact that much of the theory and research supporting [[psychological nativism|nativism]], [[modularity of mind]], and [[computational theory of mind]] originated at several universities located on the East Coast, including [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Tufts University]]. Conversely, much of the research and theory supporting [[empiricism]], [[emergentism]], and [[embodied cognition]] originated at several universities located on the West Coast, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[Salk Institute]], and, most notably, the [[University of California, San Diego]].  In reality, the divide is not so clear, with many universities and scholars on both coasts (as well as the Midwest and around the world) supporting each position, as well as more moderate positions in between the two extremes.  The phrase was coined by [[Jerry Fodor]] at an [[MIT]] conference on [[cognition]], at which he referred to another researcher as a "West Coast theorist," apparently unaware that the researcher worked at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Blank Slate:The Modern Denial of Human Nature |last=Pinker |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few researchers adhere strictly to the extreme positions highlighted by the East Pole–West Pole debate.  That is, there are very few empiricists who believe in the [[John Locke|Lockean]] ideal of the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (namely, that children are born with no innate knowledge or constraints), and there are very few nativists who agree with [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor's]] assertion that all concepts that are learned over the course of life are present in the mind prior to birth.  Nevertheless, most scholars within the fields of [[cognitive science]] and [[developmental psychology]] affiliate themselves with one of the two positions through the means of their research.

The two books best known for espousing the empiricist and nativist positions within the context of cognitive psychology are ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]'' by [[Jeffrey Elman]] et al. and ''[[The Modularity of Mind]]'' by [[Jerry Fodor]], respectively.  Incidentally, the authors are affiliated with the two institutions on which the East Pole–West Pole metaphor is based, [[UCSD]] and [[MIT]], affirming the relevance and pervasiveness of this moniker for the intellectual divide.

'''Ecological anthropology''' is a sub-field of [[anthropology]] and is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|pages=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their [[culture]] to maintain their [[ecosystems]]".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Ecological anthropology developed from the approach of [[cultural ecology]], and it provided a [[conceptual framework]] more suitable for [[scientific inquiry]] than the cultural ecology approach.&lt;ref name="Moran"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|title=People and nature : an introduction to human ecological relations|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-0572-9|pages=31–32|edition=3. [repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to [[environmental problems]].&lt;ref name="Moran"/&gt;

== History of the domain and leading researchers ==

In the 1960s, ecological anthropology first appeared as a response to cultural ecology, a sub-field of anthropology led by [[Julian Steward]].  Steward focused on studying different modes of subsistence as methods of [[energy transfer]] and then analyzed how they determine other aspects of culture.  Culture became the [[unit of analysis]].  The first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological [[population]]s should be the unit of analysis, and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment.  It was characterised by [[systems theory]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and [[negative feedback]] analysis.&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kottak|first=Conrad P.|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 1999|volume=101|issue=1|pages=23–35|jstor=683339|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/66329/1/aa.1999.101.1.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/orlove/orlove.htm Benjamin S. Orlove] has noted that the development of ecological anthropology has occurred in stages. "Each stage is a reaction to the previous one rather than merely an addition to it".&lt;ref name="Orlove"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orlove|first=Benjamin S.|title=Ecological Anthropology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1980|volume=9|pages=235–273|jstor=2155736|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.09.100180.001315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage concerns the work of Julian Steward and [[Leslie White]], the second stage is titled '[[neofunctionalism]]' and/or '[[neoevolutionism]]', and the third stage is termed 'processual ecological anthropology'.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the first stage, two different models were developed by both White and Steward.  "The distinction is not as rigid as some critics have made it out to be, White's models of [[cultural evolution]] were [[unilinear]] and monocausal, whereas Steward admitted a number of different lines of [[cultural development]] and a number of different causal factors.&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; During the second stage, it was noted that the later group agreed with Steward and White, while the other disagreed. 'Neoevolutionists' borrowed from the work of [[Charles Darwin]]. The general approach suggested that "evolution is progressive and leads towards new and better forms in succeeding periods".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Neofunctionalists' "see the social organization and culture of specific populations as functional adaptations which permit the populations to exploit their environments successfully without exceeding their carrying capacity".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; 'Processual ecological anthropology' is noted to be new. Studies based on this approach "seek to overcome the split in the second stage of ecological anthropology between excessively short and long time scales".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt; The approach more specifically, examines "shifts and changes in individual and group activities, and they focus on the mechanism by which behavior and external constraints influence each other".&lt;ref name="Orlove"/&gt;

One of the leading practitioners within this sub-field of anthropology was [[Roy Rappaport]]. He delivered many outstanding works on the relationship between culture and the natural environment in which it grows, especially concerning the role of [[ritual]] in the processual relationship between the two. He conducted the majority, if not all, of his fieldwork amongst a group known as the [[Maring (Papua New Guinea)|Maring]], who inhabit an area in the highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

[[Patricia K. Townsend]]'s work highlights the difference between ecological anthropology and [[environmental anthropology]]. In her view, some anthropologists use both terms in an interchangeable fashion.  She states that, "Ecological anthropology will refer to one particular type of research in environmental anthropology – field studies that describe a single ecosystem including a human population".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Studies conducted under this sub-field "frequently deal with a small population of only a few hundred people such as a [[village]] or [[neighbourhood]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

==Globalization effects on the discipline==

Studies under the discipline are concerned with the [[ethnoecology|ethnoecologies]] of [[indigenous populations]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Due to various factors associated with [[globalization]], [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ethnoecologies are facing increasing challenges such as, "migration, media, and commerce spread people, institutions, information, and technology".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; "In the face of national and international incentives to exploit and degrade, ethnological systems that once preserved local and regional environments increasingly are ineffective or irrelevant".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; Threats also exist of "commercial logging, industrial pollution, and the imposition of external management systems" on their local ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;  These threats to indigenous ways of life are a familiar occurrence in the field of anthropology.  Conrad Phillip Kottak states that, "Today's ecological anthropology , aka environmental anthropology, attempts not only to understand but also to find solutions to environmental problems".&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; The discipline's one of the approaches for finding such solutions is contemplating which aspects of human nature lead to environmental degradations. Such features of human nature can include a desire for technological innovations, aspiration for higher social status, and preoccupied or biased inclination to social justice.&lt;ref name="Kopnina2013"/&gt; Another approach to deal with contemporary climate issue is applying a norm of traditional ecological knowledge. Long-term ecological knowledge of an indigenous group can provide valuable insight into adaptation strategies, community-based monitoring, and dynamics between culturally important species and human.&lt;ref name="Vinyeta&amp;Lynn2013"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==

From the beginning various scholars criticised the discipline, saying it inherently was too focused on [[Static equilibrium|static equilibrii]] which ignored change, that it used [[circular reasoning]], and that it oversimplified systems.&lt;ref name=Vayda&amp;McCay1975/&gt;{{attribution needed|date=June 2013}} One of the current criticisms{{by whom|date=June 2013}} is that, in its original form, ecological anthropology relies upon [[cultural relativism]] as the [[norm (social)|norm]].&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; However, in today's world, there are few cultures that are isolated enough to live in a true [[Cultural relativity|culturally relative]] state. Instead, cultures are being influenced and changed by [[Mass media|media]], [[government]]s, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], businesses, etc.&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt; In response, the discipline has seen a shift towards applied ecological anthropology, [[political ecology]] and [[environmental anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Kottak"/&gt;

'''Endurance art''' is a kind of [[performance art]] involving some form of hardship, such as pain, solitude or exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;For artists in endurance performances "[q]uestioning the limits of their bodies," Tatiana A. Koroleva, ''Subversive Body in Performance Art'', ProQuest, 2008, pp. 29, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Performances that focus on the passage of long periods of time are also known as '''durational art''' or '''durational performances'''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Allain, Jen Harvie, ''The Routledge Companion to Theatre and Performance'', Routledge, 2014, p. 221. Other terms include duration art, live art or time-based art.&lt;p&gt;
Beth Hoffmann, "The Time of Live Art," in [[Deirdre Heddon]], Jennie Klein (eds.), ''Histories and Practices of Live Art'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Michael Fallon traces the genre to the work of [[Chris Burden]] in California in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fallon, ''Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s'', Counterpoint, 2014, p. 106: "Burden's performances were so widely observed that they took on a life beyond the artist, helping create a new art genre, 'endurance art' ..." &lt;/ref&gt; Burden spent five days in a locker in ''Five-Day Locker Piece'' (1971), had himself shot in ''Shoot'' (1971), and lived for 22 days in a bed in an art gallery in ''Bed Piece'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Emily Anne Kuriyama, [http://ca.complex.com/style/2013/10/chris-burden-art-new-museum/back-to-you "Everything You Need to Know About Chris Burden's Art Through His Greatest Works"], ''Complex'', 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of endurance art include [[Tehching Hsieh]]'s ''One Year Performance 1980–1981 (Time Clock Piece)'', in which for 12 months he punched a time clock every hour, and ''Art/Life One Year Performance 1983–1984 (Rope Piece)'', in which Hsieh and [[Linda Montano]] spent a year tied to each other by an eight-foot rope.&lt;ref name=Taylor30April2014&gt;Andrew Taylor, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/tehching-hsieh-the-artist-who-took-the-punches-as-they-came-20140429-37fri.html "Tehching Hsieh: The artist who took the punches as they came"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 30 April 2014: "Don't try this endurance art at home. That is Tehching Hsieh's advice to artists inspired to emulate the five year-long performances he began in the late 1970s."&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The House with the Ocean View'' (2003), [[Marina Abramović]] lived silently for 12 days without food or entertainment on a stage entirely open to the audience.&lt;ref name=McEvilleyApril2003&gt;Thomas McEvilley, "Performing the Present Tense – A recent piece by Marina Abramovic blended endurance art and Buddhist meditation," ''Art in America'', 91(4), April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such is the physical stamina required for some of her work that in 2012 she set up what she called a [[Fitness boot camp|"boot camp"]] in Hudson, New York, for participants in her multiple-person performances.&lt;ref name=Feiss23May2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43865">The '''European History Network''' has run a number of projects under the banner of the Creating Links and Overviews for a New History Agenda (CLIOH) since 1988, including CLIOH, CLIOHnet and CLIOHnet2. Both CLIOHRES and CLIOH-WORLD are currently in operation as of December 2011. It was initially founded as the ECTS History Network, a pilot project of the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

[http://meldinger.uib.no/engelsk.php?id=51001123731 University of Bergen news]&lt;/ref&gt; CLIOHnet2, CLIOHRES) to improve the understanding of national histories as they are studied, taught and learned in European universities. These projects have linked national historical narratives, and prepared tools and materials to structure history programs. These help make learners aware of how national historical viewpoints have been created, and how and why they may contrast with the beliefs and understandings about history in neighboring countries.

CLIOH-WORLD is using its consolidated experience and methodology to develop the learning and teaching of [[European Union]] history, including [[European integration]] and expansion, and to encourage awareness and understanding of the links between European history and the histories of other continents. CLIOH-WORLD has five working groups:

=== Working groups ===

==== 1. History of European Integration and of the European Union ====
'''Why is there a need for the History of EU and European Integration?'''

History is an important tool not only for increasing knowledge of the human past, but also for enhancing the awareness and the identity of human social and political communities, of which the [[European Union]] is one. In order to achieve a better understanding of what the European Union is and what it means to be a European citizen it is essential to improve the knowledge and understanding of both the history of the European integration process and the history of the European Union itself. Universities are an important place where students can acquire such essential knowledge and awareness in a mature way.

European Union History is not the same as the History of [[European Integration]] and vice versa: the two terms cover different aspects of European History. The main focus of the History of the European Union is on the history of a very dense kind of European Integration, centred on institutionalised forms of integration and on the member states of the European Union.

On the contrary, the History of European Integration also covers aspects of integration that go beyond the European Union. Moreover, to reach a mature comprehension of the complex political, social, economic and juridical framework in which the EU has been conceived and built, it is important to broaden our view back in history before 1945 and [[World War II]]. One of the most obvious tools of analysis that history offers is ‘historical perspective’, the diachronic dimension that provides important insights into present-day phenomena. The understanding of long term aspects, events and processes, is also vital in building a critically aware European citizenship.

The task of the [[Working group|Working Group]] is to increase both knowledge and understanding of the European integration process and the history of the European Union. In order to reach such important goals the group has decided to map the current situation and to produce and disseminate Guidelines and Reference points for Higher Education programmes in Europe. Our{{Who|date=January 2011}} findings are offered freely as information, ideas and recommendations. The tools produced by the group can be adopted by or may simply inspire those who face the need to (re)design history programmes.

'''The Role of History of EU and European Integration on European Universities: the Mapping Results'''

The Working Group undertook an extensive survey of the current state of European Union and European Integration History learning and teaching, through detailed mapping of selected countries (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK), and supplemented this with further sample-based mapping of other countries in Europe (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Malta, Romania) and beyond Europe (Japan). On this basis the Group feels confident that it has produced a reasonably representative basis on which to assess the field.

Although the mapping covered a broad and diverse range of countries and institutions, a number of common points were evident. In particular, it was striking that there is very little learning/teaching specifically dedicated to the history of the European Union or European integration. Courses devoted to these subjects are overwhelmingly oriented towards political science, legal or linguistic studies. Where there was evidence of a historical approach to the subject it tended to be framed within either national histories (the relations between one state and the rest of Europe) or included in general histories of Europe, wherein the history of the EU and of European integration was treated either as a discrete part of the whole or implicitly (rather than explicitly) embedded in studies of post-1945 west European political and economic development.

The difficulty of identifying historical approaches to the subject underlined the problems of defining what that history is, however. There are a number of issues that make a neat definition of European Union history and the history of European integration problematic. These are principally chronological and thematic. If we seek to add a historical dimension to existing institutional studies of the European Union and of European integration, for example, questions arise about cultural and historical connections (what might be termed ‘European-ness’) which in turn open up problems of periodisation (specifically, whether an exclusively post-1945 focus is adequate, but if not how should the chronological parameters be defined?).

The importance of history in programmes of European Studies is in fact not very pronounced, although history is often mentioned in the programme descriptions. Even where European Union history is reasonably well covered, it is usually as one optional module, a fact which raises issues about coherence, or the importance of thinking about what that History is. Although dealing with “Europe” is quite popular in European academic institutions and many universities and departments offer courses on “European history” or the history of European regions, an explicit focus on European History or the history of European integration is not very widespread.

“European history” is often seen as history that happened in Europe or parts of it, not in a comparative way that contrasts or connects different structures and addresses the process of European integration. With these problems and questions in mind, it was possible to return to the original mapping results with a view to identifying ‘interesting’ practice that might illuminate some of these issues and how they had been addressed, and allow the Group to move towards a more meaningful interpretation of what constitutes European Union history and the history of European integration. It is these results that are to be used to inform the development of guidelines framed within the language and methodology of Tuning.

'''What can we learn from examples of good and interesting practice?'''

Examples of good and interesting practice{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} can be found in all of the countries that were mapped in detail. These examples can be found on several levels.
1.) On the level of programmes it is seen{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as good practice if courses on European Union history and the history of European integration are a – preferably compulsory – part of programmes of European studies or European history.

2.) Courses are seen as good and interesting practice if they cover European Union history and history of European integration in a way that goes beyond an institutional history of the European Union and its organisations. Some selected examples will illustrate these examples of good and interesting practice. At the beginning of the Masters programme “Sociology – European societies“ (Freie Universität Berlin [DE]) there is a module that deals with “the process of political integration in Europe and the development of European societies after 1945”.

The link between European integration and the development of societies broadens the horizon of the history of European integration. Critical views on the process of integration are also presented in a lecture series forming part of the Master of European Studies (MES) offered by the Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt on Oder (DE). What is interesting{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} in this example is also the interior multi-disciplinary approach, also used in other courses such as “Interdisciplinary Analysis of EU“ (in the “Integrated Studies of Europe” Programme, Universität Bremen [DE] ).

Here topics such as cultural pluralism and “European identity” or the transformation of the welfare state and “social Europe” are dealt with. The latter topic is the main focus of the Master in European Union Studies offered at Paris-Lodron Universität, Salzburg (AT). Here, courses on social and economic history in the longue durée (18th – 21st centuries) and courses that put EU integration in a pan-European and global framework can be seen as examples of good practice. That is also the case in a course on “Transnational History” at St Andrews (UK) that deals with the interconnections between European societies and non-European regions from the 18th century. That the history of integration after 1945 is very much affected by historical events that happened before 1945 is dealt with in a course on “European History since 1945” (University College, University of London [UK])

There particular attention is paid to the impact of experiences and memories of war, occupation, resistance and the holocaust in the period after 1945. Also the programme in European Studies (M.E.S.) at the University of Vienna, Austria, offers compulsory courses on “Plans for Europe in a historical context before 1945” and “Basics of European integration politics on a historical foundation”. A comparative and transnational approach to the idea of Europe in a long durée perspective is pursued in the second cycle programme in “European Historical Studies” at the University of Évora (Portugal).

Emphasis on the above-mentioned aspect of “European-ness” can be seen in several courses, such as “Culture and Identities in a Contested Continent” (Open University, UK). Here, Europe is defined as a contested and a dynamic space, rather than as a fixed geographical entity. Ideas and concepts of Europe are also part of the programmes on the European Union and European integration at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) that are mainly taught from a historical perspective.

The Faculty of Humanities (Letters) of the University of Coimbra emerges as an example of interesting practice due to the strong presence of the subject across a range of scopes and levels: from a single course unit on EU history compulsory for history students to first and second cycle programmes on European Studies where History is one of the five major fields of research. It can be considered good practice to offer joint studies that stress a broad transnational perspective. The University of Coimbra is – as one example among many – a member of a network of Universities that, with the support of the European Commission, organises a Master in European Studies: “The Process of Building Europe“.

'''Good practice in EU and European Integration history'''

As the group mapped the situation and took a deeper look at examples of good and interesting practice, several factors emerged that – by integrating historical approaches – are useful for improving learning and teaching of European Union and European integration history:

# Placing recent decades in a longue durée perspective, including history before 1945.
# Dealing with aspects of European-ness (perceptions and representations, memory and history), hence with cultural and social history as well as with institutional history.
# Analysing ‘integration’ as a complex process that comprises both integration and disintegration.
# Adding a view of European history from outside Europe and analysing the links of European societies with non-European regions.
# Adopting an inter and multi-disciplinary approach.
# Offering joint programmes on the basis of cooperation between universities. These general findings can be elaborated and specified in terms of key competences seen as useful for students in programmes that deal with European Union and European integration history.

'''What should we know, understand and be able to do? Key Competences in EU-history and the History of European Integration'''

According to the Tuning Educational Structures in Europe project, the objective of single course modules and degree programmes is to develop “competences”, in the broadest sense, in the learner. In substance the central element in organising the learning process is what the person involved will know, understand and be able to do at the end of it.

Attitude too, in this case the historical mind-set or approach, is fundamental. Using the Tuning results of the History Subject Area Group as a starting point, we have examined in depth a number of key competences to be developed in studies in the area of the History of the European Union and European Integration. These may be exemplified by the following:

'''A critical awareness of the relationship between current events in the EU and processes in the past and awareness of differences in historiographical outlooks in various periods and contexts'''

Learners should be aware that EU history does not start with European integration in the form of the European communities after 1945 and that processes and structures going further back than 1945 strongly influence the present situation in the EU and the perception of the EU by its inhabitants. Learners should be aware that current events are often seen through an inherited perspective that is historically based in national and regional frameworks.

Knowledge of the history of Europe is necessary to be able to interpret the different perceptions of current events in various European nations and regions. The knowledge that the learners should acquire in order to be aware of a relationship between current events and processes in the past is not primarily based on simple facts and dates but also on a knowledge of basic structures, the economic and social situation, demography, religion and political systems.

Learners should also be able to identify the role of national or regional myths and interpret the often “invented“ significance of certain historical events in the context of the “identities” forged by European nations and their instrumental use and propagation in national/nationalistic historiography.

'''Ability to place events and structures in historical perspective'''

While a literal interpretation of European Union history – its institutional history / development since 1945 – can be reasonably easily defined and adds to legal and political science approaches, it is important that students also develop an appreciation of European history that predates World War II. Students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the complex and contested historical origins of the European Union and be able to justify their chosen definition of what constitutes EU history.

This will require them to understand the complementary and divergent natures of specific (e.g. local or national) histories within the EU (to examine the EU as [more than] the sum of its parts) as well as external perspectives on the EU. They should, therefore, demonstrate an understanding of the multiplicity of EU histories defined both chronologically and geographically. By examining the internal and external histories of the EU, students will be able to define “EU history” and its place in world history.

'''Ability to define suitable research topics to contribute to historiographical knowledge and debate'''

The learner should be able to identify a number of significant studies relating to the history of European integration and cooperation during the 20th and the 21st centuries, including for example the concrete acts regarding it, the ideas surrounding it and the obstacles to it; to connect these works with the historical and political context in which they were produced; and to define the position of the author with respect to the historical, political, methodological and theoretical questions addressed.

The learner should be able, on this basis, to pose new questions for research having the potential to advance knowledge and debate, of a complexity appropriate to the level of study. The learner should be able to elaborate a research plan, organised around bibliography, documents and other sources (oral, written, material), as appropriate to address the questions posed and to revise (broaden, perfect) it in relation to his or her findings.

'''Ability to identify and utilise appropriate sources of information for a research project'''

The European Union is sometimes compared to an onion (as a sphere) with concentric layers. This is because it has a horizontal synchronic geographical segmentation and a diachronic vertical periodization. Learners need to acquire competences that allow them to distinguish, compare and analyse different periods and spaces of European and European Union history. This will require competences in finding, classifying and using critically sources of information appropriate to the historical time period, geographical space or phenomena analysed.

Students should have at least a basic knowledge of the methodology of related disciplines and an ability to use this interdisciplinary methodological arsenal (e.g. International Relations theories, security studies, comparative political sociology and political science theory). Learners should be able to combine sources of different kinds (e.g. treaties, European Union law, the acquis communitaire [the body of EU law established until now], audiovisual materials, press releases, discourses, political programmes) and forms (written, electronic sources, official sites of EU administration), address them with critical awareness and analyse them in the appropriate historical, national, international or EU community context.

'''Interdisciplinarity'''

The learner should be aware of and able to use tools of other human sciences as well as those of the various branches of historical research. This entails understanding that different kinds of history (e.g. economic, political, intellectual, cultural, social, institutional, legal, diplomatic, gender and religious history; history of international relations) as well as other human sciences (anthropology, literary criticism, history of language, art history, archaeology, law, sociology, philosophy) are indispensable tools for creating a critical awareness of the relationship between current events related to EU history and the processes of the past, a critical point in student competences.

Moreover, the learner should understand and be critically aware that many of these different branches of history or human sciences may offer a specific focused viewpoint for analyzing the history of the EU in a more profound way. This kind of perspective allows the learner to perceive the differences between the various approaches to EU history and to European history in a broader sense, fostering critical awareness of the way many political discourses are founded on a specific historical view of Europe and its history.

In fact, many different approaches may be used, both in studying the European Union, and in studying European History, but not all of them are equally correct in terms of historical analysis and methodology: some are functional to particular political points of view and based on revisionist or nationalist perspectives. The history of the European Union is more than the sum of the histories of many different countries plus the history of the European Union itself. The EU, just like European citizenship and European identity, can be considered multi-layered or stratified. It is a complex system and requires a multi-faceted approach.

==== 2. World and Global History ====
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

==== 3. E-learning and Digitisation ====
The arrival of the digital age has transformed and is continuing to transform the study of history and the way it is taught. History has embraced the opportunities presented by digitization and e- learning; it is now grasping the ever-greater possibilities offered and tackling the challenges that come with them. Indeed, history as discipline possesses the necessary tools, particularly in the vital area of source criticism, to evaluate and validate the vast amount of information made available through the new technologies.

Interest in making archival materials and collections available has therefore been widely spread among historians. There are many university-based projects to digitise collections of archival materials, history journals are well represented in scholarly on- line source collections such as [[Project Muse]] and [[JSTOR]], and discussion forums are a regular feature of history modules. The value of such developments for the scholar and student of history are evident.

Digital collections reduce the need to travel to archives, search engines enable relevant material to be found more quickly, the availability of materials online reduces the pressure on paper resources in the library and enable more students to use the same materials simultaneously, and, lastly, e-learning tools provide the opportunity to extend the contact time between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. E-learning also opens up apparently limitless possibilities for distance learning, allowing students across the globe to learn together online.

There are of course a number of problems associated with digitization and e-learning that have yet to be resolved or that must, at least, be acknowledged alongside the opportunities opened up. Digitization has proceeded unevenly, with, for example, a disproportionate representation of English-language materials, and it often reflects the same biases to be found in more traditional collections of materials: thus men tend to be more visible as historical protagonists than women.

Search engines can limit the unwary scholar to a narrow gaze, only identifying those documents which contain particular terms, while missing others with a more subtle relevance to a particular question, and plucking journal articles and primary materials from their context. In terms of e-learning, teachers and students have both expressed concerns about the extent to which online interaction compares favourably with a more traditional lesson in a classroom.

''' The Importance of Digitization and e-Learning to CLIOHWORLD Project'''

The importance of engaging with the digital world has been understood by all the CLIOH projects, not least the current CLIOHWORLD. CLIOHWORLD maintains a website to facilitate communication with its many members, and also to reach out to a much wider audience of scholars, teachers and students of history. Central to the CLIOHWORLD project is the dissemination of learning materials.

The project has already pioneered making available electronically resources for teaching which represent the latest scholarship on numerous key topics related to thematic and national histories. CLIOHWORLD’s current focus is on improving European citizens’ understanding of their own history, especially the history of integration, while placing Europe in a global context. It is not surprising that in order to achieve this, several of the working groups on the project have produced readers and online teaching guides dedicated to their particular fields, and that more are in preparation.

'''Tasks of the Working Group on Digitization'''

The tasks of the Working Group are threefold: to increase the visibility of CLIOHWORLD online; to map the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities; and to produce a report which explores the opportunities and challenges related to recent developments in digitization and e-learning.

'''(1) Increasing visibility of CLIOHWORLD and associated projects'''

One of the wonders of the digital age has been the proliferation of resources online, but this presents the challenge of how to maintain a profile in what can often seem like a jungle of information. Our Working Group has made it a priority to raise the profile of CLIOHWORLD by giving it, and its sister organisation CLIOHRES, a presence on the ubiquitous Wikipedia and creating a CLIOHWORLD page on the increasingly popular social networking site Facebook.

It is particularly appropriate that CLIOHWORLD should be found on both these sites, for it ties in with the project’s aims to reach out across the continent, and now globally, to promote a critical understanding of European history, and to disseminate teaching materials to help learners of all ages study this topic. Links to the considerable resources on European history already available on the CLIOHWORLD website have been included on both pages. As mentioned above, many of the other Working Groups of CLIOHWORLD expect to produce online resources related to their particular themes and links to these can be added as appropriate to Wikipedia and Facebook.

'''(2) Mapping the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities'''

It is easy to assume that engagement with digital and e-learning resources is universal and at the same level, yet many universities, and departments within them, are at different stages of taking advantage of the opportunities such resources offer. The Working Group is mapping the use of digital and e-learning resources in the universities of CLIOHWORLD partners using an online survey. We hope to identify what digital resources are being used by individuals and their colleagues to support their teaching; get a sense of the way in which e-learning tools are being utilised to facilitate and enhance student experience; and explore the extent to which such endeavours are supported at a departmental, faculty and institutional level.

The last issue addressed in the questionnaire is the challenges faced by teachers in making use of digital resources and e-learning tools. It is often assumed, for example, that young people are automatically computer literate and skilled in the use of search engines and digital resources, but it is often the case that they require training and support. Tied closely with this is our final question which addresses the issue of competencies.

The Tuning project has identified a number of key competencies which students of history can be expected to demonstrate. Three competences are related to the use of digital and e-learning resources: knowledge of and ability to use information retrieval tools, such as […] e-references; ability to use computer and internet resources for elaborating historical or related data; and ability to identify and utilise appropriately sources of information […] for research projects. We hope to identify the extent to which the competences listed are sufficient to enable a student to use digital materials and e-learning tools.

Our initial results suggest that considerable numbers of university lecturers are making use of some digital resources and e-learning tools, but that not all resources available are used equally. Thus databases of sources are more popular than YouTube videos, and e-learning platforms are used more often than wikis and blogs. Many expressed concerns about the limited nature of training available to staff, which helps explain the disproportionate use of the least challenging digital and e-learning resources. The results from this questionnaire will feed into our third output which is a report.

'''(3) Information gathering on digitization and e-learning'''

The field of digitization and e-learning is fast-moving and Working Group 3 aims to keep CLIOHWORLD abreast of those changes, as well as produce materials that can be used a guide for scholars, teachers and students. Thus, the group is working on a report which builds on and updates the research it conducted for CLIOHnet 2 and explores new developments in digitization and e-learning resources. Three main areas for further research have been identified:

'''(a) Researching history'''

Digital resources have transformed the experience of researching. Comparing the Gutenbergian book format and new digital formats increases our awareness of the opportunities offered and limitations imposed by both media and the experience of using them. As digital resources have increased, so too have digital research aids, like Zotero, and understanding their role and place in global historical research is vital.

Such tools are designed to facilitate the building of international virtual research groups and to enhance the individual researcher’s experience of online research. Questions remain, however, around the extent to which such tools improve scholarly enquiry. Do such tools represent a threat to the traditional historical skills associated with archival research? Similarly, the proliferation of online resources is changing the nature and role of archives and libraries, and it is useful to consider the consequences of these developments.

'''(b) Publishing history'''

Just as digitization is changing the nature of the archiving of primary materials, it is also influencing the publication of secondary materials. Journals are published online as a matter of course and projects to digitise books are underway in a number of guises. It is important to note though that while online journals are extremely popular amongst scholars, there is perhaps still some resistance to reading books online or using the new electronic book readers like Kindle. Other new methods for publishing historical material like Drupal, WordPress and so on also need to be discussed, for they raise wider questions about the effect of open-access publishing and the barriers to achieving this.

'''(c) Teaching history'''

Digital resources and e-learning tools have the potential to enhance teaching. Digital resources relieve pressure on more traditional sources and make available to students previously inaccessible documents and materials. Where digital resources are concerned, however, it is vital that teachers of history also equip students to deal with the challenges they pose. The, at times, lax checks and balances which govern online publishing mean that the unwary may use unreliable or poor quality materials in the place of more scholarly resources.

Universities are also increasingly aware of the opportunities for expanding their reach and recruitment using e-learning tools, with lectures being posted on YouTube and online courses being developed to enable distance learning. Even social networking sites like Facebook and virtual worlds like Second Life are proving to be of use to educational institutions, facilitating communication and, in the latter case, enabling the recreation of artefacts, battlegrounds and even cities of the past.

The Working Group has interviewed one teacher of history on her experiences of using Second Life as a teaching tool and will include details of this case study in the report. As the interview highlighted, questions remain, however, about the extent to which such online interaction is an adequate or satisfying replacement for traditional classroom based activities.

==CLIOHRES==
[http://www.cliohres.net/ CLIOHRES] (“Creating Links and Innovative Overviews for a New History Research Agenda for the Citizens of a Growing Europe") is a Sixth Framework Programme Network of Excellence organized by a group of 45 [[university|universities]], many of which are CLIOH.net members.

A five-year project, it aims at achieving and disseminating greater understanding of both the actual histories and the representations of the past current in Europe today, highlighting both diversities and connections and explaining the development context. It brings together historians, geographers, art historians, linguists, theologists, philologists, sociologists and philosophers in order to explore how differences, connections, conflicts and positive interaction have developed in the past and can develop in the future. It involves 180 research staff and doctoral students from 31 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communities in European history |last=Pan-Montojo |first=Juan |authorlink= |author2=Frederik Pedersen |year=2007 |publisher=Edizioni Plus |location= |isbn=88-8492-462-6 |page=8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7aH-tU3x3UC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLIOHRES has six thematic working groups. They are:

# States, legislation, institutions
# Power and culture, including language, art and architecture
# Religious and Philosophical concepts
# Work, Gender and Society
# Frontiers and Identities
# Europe and the World

=== Work, Gender and Society Thematic Working Group ===
The exact priorities, pathways and specific work-plan of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) of Cliohres responsible for work, gender and society will be defined by the Group and will follow the general scheme outlined. However, on the basis of previous planning, the agenda is to examine the different ways in which society has organized itself in different times and places, with respect to the organization of labor, the definition of gender roles, civic and family structures.

The ways these forms of organization have been or have not been exported to other parts of the world, the extent to which they define a kind of European-ness, or vice versa, the extent to which national, regional and chronological differences are significant within Europe will be examined as will the links with colonial society and with political and economic changes in the role of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. The central methodological core around which this TWG will work sees the study of gender as a valuable tool for understanding social evolutions rather than as an end in itself.

By analogy to evidence-based medicine (EBM),&lt;ref name=eddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=D.M.|title=Evidence-Based Medicine: A Unified Approach|journal=Health Aff|year=2005|volume=24|issue=1|pages=9–17|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9|pmid=15647211}}&lt;/ref&gt; the umbrella term evidence-based toxicology (EBT) has been coined to group all approaches intended to better implement the above-mentioned evidence-based principles in toxicology in general and in toxicological decision-making in particular. Besides systematic reviews, the core evidence-based tool, such approaches include ''inter alia'' the establishment and universal use of a common ontology, justified design and rigorous conduct of studies, consistently structured and detailed reporting of experimental evidence, probabilistic uncertainty and risk assessment, and the development of synthesis methodology to integrate evidence from diverse evidence streams, e.g. from human observational studies, animal studies, in vitro studies and in silico modeling. A main initial impetus for translating evidence-based approaches to toxicology was the need to improve the performance assessment of toxicological test methods.&lt;ref name=hoff05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|author2=Hartung, T|title=Diagnosis: toxic!

A key tool in evidence-based medicine that holds promise for EBT is the systematic review.  Historically, authors of reviews assessing the results of toxicological studies on a particular topic have searched, selected, and weighed the scientific evidence in a non-systematic and non-transparent way.  Due to their narrative nature, these reviews tend to be subjective, potentially biased, and not readily reproducible.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;  Two examples highlighting these deficiencies are the risk assessments of trichloroethylene and bisphenol A (BPA).  Twenty-seven different risk assessments of the evidence that trichloroethylene causes cancer have come to substantially different conclusions.&lt;ref name=ruden03&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|title=The use and evaluation of primary data in 29 trichloroethylene carcinogen risk assessments|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|year=2001|volume=34|pages=3–16|doi=10.1006/rtph.2001.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessments of BPA range from low risk of harm to the public to potential risks (for some populations), leading to different political decisions.&lt;ref name=whaley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whaley|first=P.|author2=Halsall, C. |author3=Ågerstrand, R.A. |author4=Aiassa, E. |title=Implementing systematic review techniques in chemical risk assessment: Challenges, opportunities and recommendations.|journal=Environ Int|year=2016|volume=92-93|pages=556–64|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2015.11.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic reviews can help reducing such divergent views.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt; In contrast with narrative reviews, they reflect a highly structured approach to reviewing and synthesizing the scientific literature while limiting bias.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;  The steps to carrying out a systematic review include framing the question to be addressed; identifying and retrieving relevant studies; determining if any retrieved studies should be excluded from the analysis; and appraising the included studies in terms of their methodological quality and risk of bias.  Ultimately the data should be synthesized across studies, if possible by a meta-analysis.  A protocol of how the review will be conducted is prepared ahead of time and ideally should be registered and/or published.

Scientists have made progress in their efforts to apply the systematic review framework to evaluating the evidence for associations between environmental toxicants and human health risks.  To date, researchers have shown that important elements of the framework established in evidence-based medicine can be adapted to toxicology with little change, and some studies have been attempted.&lt;ref name=Navas-Acien05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navas-Acien|first=A.|author2=Sharrett, A.

== Background ==

Evidence-based approaches were first conceived as a means of anchoring policy decisions, not to current practices or the beliefs of experts, but to experimental evidence.&lt;ref name=Eddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=D.M.|title=Practice Policies:  Guidelines for Methods.|journal=JAMA|year=1990|volume=263|issue=13|pages=1839–1841|doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440130133041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) was launched slightly later. Its rise as a distinct discipline is generally credited to the work and advocacy of Scottish epidemiologist Archie Cochrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=D.|title=Essential Evidence-Based Medicine|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] named in his honor was launched at Oxford University in 1993 to promote evidence-based reviews of clinical medical literature. More recently, EBM expanded to encompass [[evidence-based health care]] (EBHC).

EBM/HC involves the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients taking patients' preferences into account.&lt;ref name=Sackett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sackett|first=D.L.|author2=Rosenberg, W.M. |author3=Gray, J.A. |author4=Haynes, R.B. |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't|journal=BMJ|year=1996|volume=312|pages=71–72|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to EBM, medical decisions about diagnosis, prevention, treatment or harm were often made without a rigorous evaluation of the alternatives.  Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that different physicians regularly recommended different treatments and tests for patients with ailments that were essentially the same, and that large proportions of procedures being performed by physicians were considered inappropriate by the standards of medical experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wennberg|first=J.E.|author2=Gittelsohn, A.|title=Small Area Variations in Health Care Delivery|journal=Science|year=1973|volume=182|issue=4117|pages=1102–1108|doi=10.1126/science.182.4117.1102|pmid=4750608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chassin|first=M.R.|author2=Kosecoff J. |author3=Solomon D.H. |author4=Brook R.H. |title=How Coronary Angiography Is Used: Clinical Determinants of Appropriateness|journal=JAMA|year=1987|volume=258|issue=18|pages=2543–2547|doi=10.1001/jama.258.18.2543 |pmid=3312657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
EBM/HC supporters stress that while evidence always has been important to the practice of medicine, EBM/HC provides an enhanced approach of identifying, assessing, and summarizing evidence.  EBT's supporters make a similar argument.&lt;ref name="stephens13" /&gt;

The idea of translating evidence-based approaches from medicine to toxicology has been percolating for two decades, with proponents in both medicine and toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=N.A.|author2=Smith, A. J.|title=Evidence-based medicine in toxicology: where is the evidence?|journal=Lancet|year=1996|volume=347|pages=1167–1169|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(96)90615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodes|first=J.E.|title=The amalgam controversy – an evidence-based analysis|journal=J Am Dent Assoc|year=2001|volume=132|pages=348–356|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2001.0178|pmid=11258092|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three research papers published in 2005 and 2006 catalyzed what eventually became known as EBT by suggesting that EBM's established tools and concepts might serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making in toxicology.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hoff05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=guzelian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guzelian|first=P.S.|author2=Victoroff, M.S. |author3=Halmes, N.C. |title=Evidence-based toxicology: a comprehensive framework for causation|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2005|volume=24|pages=161–201|doi=10.1191/0960327105ht517oa|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process and progress ==

The First International Forum Toward Evidence-Based Toxicology was held in 2007.&lt;ref name=Hoffman07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=S.|author2=Griesinger, C. |author3=Coecke, S. |author4=Kinser, A. |title=1st International Forum Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology.|journal=ALTEX|year=2007|volume=24|pages=354–355.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum was organized by the European Commission and attended by 170 scientists from more than 25 European, American, and Asian countries.  The goal was to explore the available concepts of EBT, and to launch an initiative to formally implement evidence-based assessment methods in toxicology.

The starting point for the discussions were two research papers suggesting that the tools and concepts established in evidence-based medicine could serve as a prototype of evidence-based decision-making for evaluating toxicological data.&lt;ref name=hoff06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hoff05 /&gt;  Apparent fundamental differences between medicine and toxicology were carefully considered during these discussions.  Forum participants attempted to bridge the two disciplines in order to make use of the accrued wisdom and apply this approach to toxicology.

The proceedings of this forum were published as a special issue in ''Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the 1st International Forum  Towards Evidence-Based Toxicology|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|year=2009|volume=28|issue=2-3|pages=71–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBT's proponents include experts in EBM, public health, and toxicology who believe that EBT can help toxicologists to better serve the goals of health protection and safety assurance.&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephens16" /&gt; They argue that EBT's methodologies for collecting, appraising, and pooling evidence can help ensure that all available information on a given topic is evaluated in a transparent, unbiased, and reproducible manner. They contend that EBT's concept of the systematic review could prove particularly helpful for the standardization and quality assurance of novel methodologies for evaluating toxicity, as well as for their formal validation.  In this regard, EBT may prove particularly useful for assessing the performance of newer non-animal “21st century” toxicology tools.  EBT can also help scientists integrate new toxicological test methods into test strategies being implemented across the globe.

In 2010, a group of EBT supporters joined together to convene a workshop titled “21st Century Validation for 21st Century Tools.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudacille|first=D.|title=Summary of the July 2010 Workshop, "21st Century Validation Strategies for 21st Century Tools"|journal=ALTEX|year=2010|volume=27|issue=2|pages=279–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The session on the potential for evidence-based approaches to assess the performance of the new generation of non-animal test methods inspired the formation of the EBTC.   The EBTC was officially launched in the U.S. in 2011 at a Society of Toxicology conference&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conference Report:  Evidence-based Toxicology Collaboration  Kick-off Meeting|journal=Altex|year=2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and convened its first workshop in 2012.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;  The EBTC's EU branch was officially opened during the 2012 Eurotox conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=S.|date=|title=Kick-off of the Evidence-Based Toxicology Collaboration Europe.|url=|journal=ALTEX|volume=29|pages=456|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the EBTC hosted a workshop on ‘The Emergence of Systematic Review and Related Evidence-based Approaches in Toxicology“ with speakers representing US and European organizations that are implementing and promoting the use of systematic reviews for toxicological questions.  The experts noted that the structured approach of systematic reviews increases objectivity and transparency but also made clear that the approach requires a substantial time investment, which is a challenge to its more widespread adoption. Consequently, the participants called for close collaboration of interested organizations, which they determined to be a pre-requisite for the broad and efficient introduction of systematic reviews in toxicology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications of EBT ==

=== Regulatory decision-making ===

Some scientists and policymakers would like EBT to help them combine information from various sources.  Toxicological evidence can be assigned to evidence streams, sets of studies representing the same type or level of evidence, such as human (observational) studies, animal studies, in vitro or mechanistic studies.  EBT can be applied both within one evidence stream, and it is especially well-suited to be applied across multiple evidence streams.  Regulators often designate one study as “the lead study,” then use later studies as additional information.  Many perceive this as unsatisfying, but objective approaches to combine study results are lacking. The EBM concept of the systematic review has promise for this application, and some structured reviews serve as forerunners for this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navas-Ancien|first=A.|author2=Guallar, E. |author3=Silbergeld, E. K. |author4=Rothenberg, S. J. |title=Lead exposure and cardiovascular disease--a systematic review|journal=Environ Health Perspect|year=2007|volume=115|pages=472–482 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9785 |pmid=17431501 |pmc=1849948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Opinion on the risk assessment peri- and post-menopausal women taking food supplements containing isoflavones.|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2015|volume=13|issue=10|pages=4246–4588doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4246|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Systematic literature review on the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pubs/ntp_rr/01fluoride_508.pdf|publisher=National Toxicology Program|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluating effects of environmental exposures ===

The U.S. National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) has started to use  systematic review methodology for the program's evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pubs/handbookjan2015_508.pdf|title=Handbook for Conducting a Literature-Based Health Assessment Using Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Approach for Systematic Review and Evidence Integration|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=National Toxicology Program|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first systematic review was completed in 2016, reviewing the effects of fluoride on learning and memory in animal studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  OHAT’s approach is tailored to its mandate, but its seems especially appropriate for substances with substantial yet conflicting literature, and hence the need for a systematic reviews to sort out somewhat confusing situations.

=== Causation ===

One application of EBT focuses on causation.&lt;ref name=guzelian /&gt;  It addresses the challenge of tracing a health effect back to a toxicant, such as lung cancer to smoking.  This approach is similar to legal arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodricks|first=J.V.|title=Evaluating disease causation in humans exposed to toxic substances|journal=J Law Policy|year=2006|volume=41|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some experts warn that this approach could increase the evidence burden for proving causation, and thereby increase the difficulty involved in banning toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rudén|first=C.|author2=Hansson, S. O.|title=Evidence-based toxicology: "sound science" in new disguise|journal=Int J Occup Environ Health|year=2008|volume=14|pages=299–306|doi=10.1179/oeh.2008.14.4.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical toxicology ===

Practitioners of clinical toxicology, which is concerned with the treatment of patients known to be exposed to toxic substances, are also beginning to use an EBM-style approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dargan|first=P.I.|author2=Wallace, C. I. |author3=Jones, A. L. |title=An evidence based flowchart to guide the management of acute salicylate (aspirin) overdose|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|pages=206–209|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.206|pmid=11971828|pmc=1725844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=C..I.|author2=Dargan, P. I. |author3=Jones, A. L. |title=Paracetamol overdose: an evidence based flowchart to guide management|journal=Emerg Med J|year=2002|volume=19|pages=202–205|doi=10.1136/emj.19.3.202|pmc=1725876}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guidance documents based on this approach have already been published.

=== 21st century toxicology ===

The National Research Council's (NRC) landmark 2007 publication, Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century, has also been an impetus for EBT. EBT provides new tools for assessing test method performance.  Also, as the focus of 21st century toxicology shifts from animal biology to human biology, EBT provides a method for comparatively evaluating the results gleaned from new methods of investigating the effects of chemical exposure.&lt;ref name="hart09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=T.|year=2009|title=Food for thought... on evidence-based toxicology|journal=ALTEX|volume=26|issue=2|pages=75–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and challenges ==

The specific differences between toxicology and medicine/health care cause challenges for implementing EBT.&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt; Evidence-based methodology of clinical research has been focused on a single type of study—randomized, controlled clinical trials, which are a direct measure of the effectiveness of the health care intervention under scrutiny.  In contrast, toxicology employs a variety of different kinds of studies in three distinct evidence streams:  human (observational) studies, animal studies, and non-animal studies.  Because human evidence is frequently lacking, most evidence is obtained by using animal and non-animal models, which—by definition—is more difficult to generalize and extrapolate to humans.  This methodological heterogeneity complicates evidence integration within an evidence stream, such as when inconsistent evidence is obtained from different animal species, but even more so across evidence streams.  Adding to the difficulty is the reality that much toxicological evidence, more so than in medicine and health care, is not readily accessible in the literature.&lt;ref name=stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=silberalt13 /&gt;  Moreover, the role of expert judgment, especially in systematic reviews, needs to be clearly defined, as it is a common misperception that evidence-based approaches leave no room for it.  Systematic reviews should strive to make expert judgments clear along with the scientific basis for those judgments in developing conclusions for a systematic review.  Further issues to be worked out include exposures to multiple substances, the multitude of outcomes observed in some animal studies, and challenges in improving the experimental designs and reporting of studies.

'''Frame-based terminology''' is a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] approach to [[terminology]] developed by [[Pamela Faber]] and colleagues at the [[University of Granada]]. One of its basic premises is that the [[conceptualization]] of any specialized domain is goal-oriented, and depends to a certain degree on the task to be accomplished. Since a major problem in modeling any domain is the fact that languages can reflect different conceptualizations and construals, texts as well as specialized knowledge resources are used to extract a set of domain concepts. Language structure is also analyzed to obtain an inventory of conceptual relations to structure these concepts.

As its name implies, frame-based terminology uses certain aspects of [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]] to structure specialized domains and create non-language-specific representations. Such configurations are the conceptual meaning underlying specialized texts in different languages, and thus facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition.

Frame-based terminology focuses on:
# conceptual organization;
# the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and
# the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora.

In frame-based terminology, conceptual networks are based on an underlying domain event, which generates templates for the actions and processes that take place in the specialized field as well as the entities that participate in them.

As a result, knowledge extraction is largely text-based. The terminological entries are composed of information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network that is capable of adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, [[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]] distinctions in texts are based on [[Robert Van Valin, Jr.|Van Valin]]'s classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the [[generative lexicon]] is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities.

The methodology of frame-based terminology derives the conceptual system of the domain by means of an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach consists of extracting information from a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of texts in various languages, specifically related to the domain. The top-down approach includes the information provided by specialized dictionaries and other reference material, complemented by the help of experts in the field. 

In a parallel way, the underlying conceptual framework of a knowledge-domain event is specified. The most generic or base-level categories of a domain are configured in a prototypical domain event or action-environment interface. This provides a template applicable to all levels of information structuring. In this way a structure is obtained which facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition since the information in term entries is internally as well as externally coherent.

'''The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants''' (or simply the '''''Glass Flowers''''') is a collection of highly realistic [[glass]] [[botany|botanical]] models at the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Created by [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]] from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in [[Hosterwitz]], near [[Dresden, Germany]], the collection was commissioned by [[George Lincoln Goodale]], the first director of Harvard's [[Botanical Museum]], and was financed by [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It includes 847 life-size models (representing 780 species and varieties of plants in 164 families) and some 3,000 detail models such as of plant parts and anatomical sections. The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models representing over 830 plant species.

==Background==
{{main|Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka}}
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Rudolf (standing) and Leopold Blaschka]]
Starting in 1863 the Blaschkas had a thriving business making glass models of [[marine invertebrate]]s, selling them to museums and private collectors in a global enterprise (see {{crossreference|[[Glass sea creatures]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1886, the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale who, after seeing their work, had gone Dresden to ask them to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; the reason for the request being that only used method at time was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens—a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color, two drawbacks which glass models did not have.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold was hesitant but eventually agreed to make some sample models which, though badly damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; convinced Goodale of their value in botanical teaching.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

To fund the project Goodale approached his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth [[Cabot family|C.]] Ware, who were already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley. Boston Bradlee Whidden, Publisher 1897&lt;/ref&gt; The original arrangement (in 1887) provided that the Blaschkas would work half time on the project, but in 1890 a new arrangement called for them to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Schultes, Richard Evans 1982"&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of Rudolph and Leopold Blaschka and the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants - http://botlib.huh.harvard.edu/libraries/glass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The work continued until 1936, at which point Leopold and Elizabeth had both died.&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

The collection is formally dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the deceased father and husband of Mary and Elizabeth Ware, respectively.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==The models==

The models are glass with wire supports (internal or external), glue, a variety of organic media,{{Explain|date=March 2017}} and paint or enamel coloring.&lt;ref&gt;NcNally, Rika Smith and Nancy Buschini (1993). [http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic32-03-002_1.html Journal of the American Institute for Conservation], Volume 32, Number 3, Article 2 (pp. 231 to 240)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' has called them "anatomically perfect and, given all the glass-workers who've tried and failed, unreproducible."&lt;ref&gt;Putting the Glass Flowers in new light - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/putting-the-glass-flowers-in-new-light/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's glass flowers return - https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2016/05/24/harvard-glass-flowers-return/SwICUX1ZgpsP3CPPeMbpuO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlassFlowers4HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4]]

It is often said that the Blaschkas employed secret techniques now lost; in fact their techniques were common at the time, but their skill, enthusiasm, and meticulous study and observation of their subjects in life were extraordinary, which Leopold ascribed to familial tradition, in a letter to Mary Lee Ware: "Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms{{nbsp}} ... &lt;!--, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation.--&gt; The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass."

The Blaschkas' primary technique was [[lampworking]], in which glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Dictionary|url=http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/l|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their old-fashioned Bohemian lamp-working table is part of the museum exhibit.
Over the years Rudolf brought more and more of the entire production process under his personal control, eventually even manufacturing his own glass and colorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Zone Books| isbn = 978-1-890951-43-6| last = Daston| first = Lorraine| title = Things that talk : object lessons from art and science| chapter = The Glass Flowers| location = New York| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Donald Schnell has called the models "enchanting", and relates his surprise at finding that the models faithfully depict an unpublished detail of a bee's behavior while pollinating a particular plant{{emdash}}a detail which he had privately hypothesized.&lt;ref&gt;Schnell, Donald (2002). Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada. Timber Press. {{ISBN|0-88192-540-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whitehouse and Small wrote that "the superiority in design and construction of the Blaschka models surpasses all modern model making to date and the skill and art of the Blaschkas rests in peace for eternity."{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Glass Flowers is one of the most noted tourist attractions of the Boston area. More than 210,000 visitors view the collection annually. In 1936, when Harvard invited the public to tour the campus in honor of its tercentenary, a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter taking the tour commented "Tercentenary or no, the chief focus of interest remains the famous glass flowers, the first of which was put on exhibition in 1893, and which with additions at intervals since, have never failed to draw exclamations of wonder or disbelief from visitors."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news

At least two poems feature the flowers:

[[Mark Doty]] (winner of the [[National Book Award]] for Poetry in 2008), "The Ware Collection of Glass Flowers and Fruit, Harvard Museum", in ''My Alexandria'', 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/6/vitreoustact.php|title=CABINET // Great Vitreous Tact|work=cabinetmagazine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|He's built a perfection out of hunger,
fused layer upon layer, swirled until
what can't be tasted, won't yield,
almost satisfies, an art
mouthed to the shape of how soft things are,
how good, before they disappear.}}

[[Marianne Moore]] wrote in a poem, "Silence",

{{poemquote|My father used to say,
"Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave,
or the glass flowers at Harvard."}}

In [[aesthetics]], the '''human figure''' or '''human form''' in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the [[Human body shape|body shape]], including [[Human positions|body postures]] - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - [[Human gait|walking]], running, [[dancing]] etc. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/leddy.html Section 17, Immanuel Kant]&lt;/ref&gt; The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that [[form follows function]], which is believed to be a result of [[evolution]] over thousands of generations.

== Study ==
The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as [[music]], though it figures in [[lyrics]]. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects:
* [[Sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/HumanForm.html Human figure in various art forms]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to figure drawing.
* [[Figure drawing]] involves the depiction of the body in different postures or in motion or at work.
* [[Literature]] involves the description of the human figure to imply its [[sexual attraction]], physical ability and mentality.
* [[Dance]] is an [[art form]] that involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.
* [[Body language]] involves [[human position|body posture]], [[gesture]]s, [[facial expression]]s, and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].
* [[Fashion]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].
* [[Ergonomics]] in passenger vehicles and seatings, this deals with [[unisex]] approach to human figure.
* [[Gait analysis]]
* [[3D animation]]

== Body proportions ==
{{Main|Body proportions}}
''Body proportions'' are the study of relation of [[human anatomy|human body]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://realcolorwheel.com/human.htm Human Proportions]&lt;/ref&gt; or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure.

== Sculpture and figure drawing ==
[[File:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|Nude study, by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
{{See also|Sculpture|figure drawing}}
A [[figure drawing]] is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]].

The '''interactive acculturation model''' ('''IAM''') seeks to integrate within a common theoretical framework the following components of [[immigrants]] and host community relations in [[multicultural]] settings:
# [[acculturation]] orientations adopted by immigrant groups in the host community;
# acculturation orientations adopted by the host community towards special groups of immigrants;
# interpersonal and intergroup relational outcomes that are the product of combinations of immigrant and host community acculturation orientations.
The framework of these established among a structural political/governmental environment. Ultimately, the goal of the model is to present a [[indeterminism|non-determinist]], more dynamic account of immigrant and host [[community acculturation]] in multicultural settings.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhuis et al., 1996.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially the model takes both sides of immigration (host and immigrant) and compares the values and desire to hold on to historical and cultural ties of the immigrant population versus the desire or degree to which the host population is willing to accommodate the immigrant influx. Examples of questions posed to the host population include:
# Do you find it acceptable that immigrants maintain their cultural [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]?
# Do you accept that immigrants adopt the culture of your host community?
The model derives two important pieces of data:
# the level to which the immigrant population is willing maintain its historical and cultural roots against;
# its desire (or lack thereof) to integrate and adopt the history and cultural traits of the host society.
The model essentially categorizes the population, based on the responses, as being in favor of [[social integration|integration]], [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or separation. When cross compared with the level of accommodation the host society is willing to provide, the model predicts whether the immigrant population will become fully assimilated, marginalized, or even isolated from the host society.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"&gt;Bourhis 377.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State attitudes to immigration and acculturation==
In the past, [[acculturation]] has been described in both a macro level where there is emphasis on processes and effects on [[populations]] and at a micro level where it describes the [[psychological]] effect on individuals. Bourhis et al., reference the earlier work of both Graves and Berry&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; in the identification of individual psychological change that the immigrant experiences during their integration into a host culture. These changes are observed in the individual who is influenced by the new culture as well as participating and interacting within the new culture. To further understand the social and psychological effects of immigrant acculturation, the Bourhis team starts their model with an analysis of structural policies that address immigration, particularly in host nations.

===State policies===

The Bourhis et al. article delineates first the [[ideologies]] that make up the basis of the policies that are present in the host state. The study very much accepts the notion that these policies are very influential in the dynamics and the eventual [[acculturation]] process that goes on by the host and immigrant people. The Bourhis team categorized the host nation policies in the manner of Breton&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"&gt;Breton, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; into state immigration policies that spell out quantities, type and origin of allowed immigrants, conditions and rules and then go on further to define the living rules that immigrants must live by in the host country such as work permits, ability to naturalize, etc. In addition we also have identified state integration policies that addressed mechanisms to help immigrants with joining into the host culture as well as measures to aid in host country acceptance of immigrants. These two types of policies may be symbiotic or at odds with each other in terms of goals and focus. The Bourhis team was primarily concerned with Western countries and noticed that in these nations, the policies, research, implementation and responsibility for both immigration and integration often resided in one sole governmental agency. This agency was often chartered with duties of writing statues, enforcing [[immigration]] laws and very possibly may be the governmental focus for assimilation and [[social integration|integration]] policy. Based on international conventions and referencing previous work by Kaplan,&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; sovereign countries possess the right and responsibility to define the limits and scope of nationality. Each country is presumed to have the right to decide who is a national and what does it take to be a national of that nation. Nations will derive their immigration policies based on a multitude of factors but in the context of state and national attitudes toward the [[immigrant populations]]. These policies define not only numbers and bureaucratic processes but also address the illegal immigration and the methods of countering it. As with all state policy, the laws enacted reflect both the majority host nation attitudes as well as help form these attitudes. The Bourhis model is premised on the adaptation of four groupings for state policies.&lt;ref name="Breton, 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drieger, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helly, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The state integration policies are not exclusive and permanent to a particular host country. The ideologies exist as a combination of the state policies and the surrounding public support that it is deemed were the basis of these policies. The state policies are usually not codified into constitutional form and are modified over time to reflect the changing circumstances and attitudes of both the people and the government. The following are described by Bourhis in the explanation of the IAM:

===Pluralist ideologies===

A construct based on the idea that the host nation expects immigrant populations to adhere and adopt host nation public values such as democracy and individual freedom but are free to maintain individual and native cultural values as long as they are within the wide confines and boundaries of host laws (native language use is OK but [[polygamy]] would not be acceptable). The policies adopted by the state would reflect a positive view of immigrants maintaining their diverse cultures and would support these differences not only socially but possibly financially. It is this last detail of financial support or government enactment of positive policy that differentiates this from a more civic ideology and state policy. Some Scandinavian countries as well as other western democracies have at times leaned this way to encourage cultural diversity and set acculturation as a state goal.

===Civic ideologies===

These policies would also maintain the premise that immigrants adopt host nation public values and that individual values are not to be dictated or regulated by the host government. But in [[civic ideologies]], there is no public financial support for these private values or for the continuation and flourishing of the particular culture. The cultural identities and values are allowed but not promoted by the host nation in a government policy of non-intervention. Many European countries and various Latin American countries espouse a civic ideology to some extent. These countries often witness flourishing immigrant populations that maintain a cultural identity and sometimes language.

===Assimilation ideology===

These are the set of beliefs and policies that support both the adoption of public values by the immigrant population but also of some private values of host nation dominant culture. We would expect these policies to dictate such aspects like a single language in the schools and encourage voluntary (sometimes mandatory) cultural integration at all levels to homogenize the expressions of the immigrant population with that of the host nation. This could not only be voluntary but encouraged or mandated and expected to happen over time. The US had essentially assimilation policies until the great influx of immigrants during the last half of the past century at which time the country has softened its attitudes and policies toward a more civic ideology. A variant to the assimilation ideology is the [[Republican ideology]] similar to that expressed in France as far back as the revolution that supposes a "[[universal man]]" that is able to suppress less desired, backward, cultural traits and require a "leveling out" in order to fully participate as an equal in the society.

===Ethnist ideology===

This is basically the idea that the state can mandate the whole of public and private values and make them a precondition to full [[citizenship]]. It occasionally is manifested in the mandatory taking of host country values as necessary by the immigrant populations or more often this ideology is expressed in a requirement to be part of an ethnicity, religion or race to be accepted as a citizen. Governments may enact blood relations requirement or parentage to conditions for citizenship. Witness countries like Switzerland, Israel and Japan where immigrants are not accepted as they lack the ethnic blood to become full members of the citizenry and can only be allowed a lesser status such as guest worker or second class citizen.

==Immigrant population attitudes==
The attitudes of immigrant populations that shape their acculturation and level of assimilation into the host society vary widely. One attitude in particular that has been explored is the concept of [[biculturalism]]. Under Gordon's (1964) proposal, he identifies a unidimensional model of acculturation that immigrant groups undergo over time as they strive to maintain equilibrium between their own culture/heritage against those of their adoptive host state. This equilibrium is essentially biculturalism, where the immigrant population retains features of their heritage culture while adopting key elements of the host’s culture. Biculturalism is transitory however,&lt;ref&gt;Goldlust, Richmond, 1974.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaFromboise, Coleman, &amp; Gerton, 19993.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over time, the immigrant population eventually assimilates into the culture of the host nation and becomes a "rightful member" of the majority, to fit into the existing social structure of the host society.&lt;ref&gt;Woldemikael, 1987. &lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

Critics of the unidimensional model cite the influx of technologically and culturally advanced European powers into less developed societies into the new world that in essence assimilated the host society. The unidimensional model fails to account for the fact that the host majority is also changed by the presence of culturally distinctive immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bidimensional model of acculturation===

Efforts to explain further acculturation and assimilation among immigrant populations led to the formulation of the Bidimensional model of acculturation. Under this model, more importance is placed in viewing the importance immigrant populations identify with the aspects of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1980.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Berry’s model of acculturation, immigrant’s attitudes are described as being focused on two points; 1) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain cultural identity and characteristics?" and 2) "Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationships with other groups?"

Various studies among Portuguese, Hungarian, Korean, and Lebanese immigrant in Canada and Indian Immigrants in the US found that the majority of these groups desired "integration" versus marginalization.&lt;ref name="Bourhis 377"/&gt; Further results off the study would go on to show that these groups who desired integration suffered less from "acculturation stress" than others. According to Berry,&lt;ref&gt;Berry, 1990b&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|Not listed in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that integration was the most widely preferred mode of acculturation in his studies suggests that pluralism [where a state expects immigrants will adopt the public values of the host country (democratic ideals and [[Penal code|criminal codes]]) but has mandate defining private value s] may constitute the ideology that best reflects the orientation of many [[first-generation immigrant]]s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Bourhis 373.&lt;br&gt;{{fontcolor|red|It is unclear which entry this is in the References section.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can thus be argued that immigrants desire to hold on to elements of their own culture but also assimilate aspects of their host culture, thus becoming "integrated" into their host society.

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistic philosophy''' is the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, the latter the position of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] and various [[U.S. state]] courts have decided several cases regarding [[pornography]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], and [[reproductive rights]].  The trend has been one of courts striking down states' attempts to regulate sex.

The following is a list of noteworthy sex-related court cases in order by date.  (Note that in the legal sense, the term "[[sodomy]]" often applies not only to [[anal sex]] but also to [[oral sex]] and other sex acts.)

*''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', {{ussc|274|200|1927}}[[Case citation|*]].  A law which allowed the state to [[compulsory sterilization|sterilize]] the mentally handicapped is [[constitutional]].
* ''[[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries]]'', [[Case citation|86 F.2d 737]] ([[2nd Cir.]] 1936). The [[Comstock act]]'s prohibition against birth control products or information as obscene/lewd or lascivious was held to not apply to shipments from a physician. The federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients.&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Note | work = The Margaret Sanger Papers | publisher = Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. | year = 1995 | url = http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html | accessdate = 2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma|Skinner v. State of Oklahoma Ex Rel. Williamson]]'', {{ussc|316|535|1942}} [[Case citation|*]]. A law punishing certain classes of criminals with [[compulsory sterilization|sterilization]] is [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].
* ''[[Roth v. United States]]'', {{ussc|354|476|1957}} [[Case citation|*]]. Obscenity is defined as material that "to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest".
* ''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', {{ussc|355|371|1958}} [[Case citation|*]]. Applying the Roth test, the Court rules that homosexual content is not by definition obscene.
*''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'', {{ussc|367|497|1961}} [[Case citation|*]]. In the absence of an actual threat of prosecution, plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge Connecticut law making use of contraceptives illegal.
*''[[McLaughlin v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|379|184|1964}} [[Case citation|*]]. The law prohibiting an unmarried interracial couple from habitually living in and occupying the same room in the nighttime that does not apply to couples of the same race violates equal protection clause.

*''[[Miller v. California]]'', {{ussc|413|15|1973}} [[Case citation|*]]. For a publication to be considered obscene, taken as a whole, it must appear to "the average person, applying contemporary community standards", to appeal to the prurient interest, depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
*''[[Jenkins v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|418|453|1974}} [[Case citation|*]]. Theatre manager's conviction of "the crime of distributing obscene material" for showing the film ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' overtuned as the film is not obscene.
*''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]'', {{ussc|420|469|1975}} A law that prohibits releasing the name of a rape victim is generally unconstitutional.

*''[[Commonwealth v. Sefranka]]'', 414 N.E.2d 602, (Mass. 1980) [[Case citation|*]]. The term "lewd, wanton and lascivious person" used in a Massachusetts sex crime statute was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to consenting adults.
*''[[Commonwealth v. Bonadio]]'', 490 Pa.91, 415 A.2d 47 (Pa. 1980)[[Case citation|*]].  A [[Pennsylvania]] law against consensual sodomy is unconstitutional.  (The state would repeal the law 15 years later.)
*''[[Baker v. Wade]]'', 553 F.Supp. 1121 (N.D.Tex. 1982) [[Case citation|*]].  Federal District Court finds Texas sodomy law unconstitutional; Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  overturns  and holds law to be constitutional.
*''[[Dronenburg v. Zech]]'', 741 F.2d 1388 (D.C.Cir.1984) [[Case citation|*]]. Administrative discharge from U.S. Navy for homosexual conduct is valid because private, consensual, homosexual conduct is not constitutionally protected.
*''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', {{ussc|478|186|1986}} [[Case citation|*]]. [[Sodomy]] between people of the same sex in the privacy of one's home may be made illegal.

*''[[City of Dallas v. England]]'', 846 S.W.2d 957; 1993 Tex. App. LEXIS 451 (1993) [[Case citation|*]] Citing ''State v. Morales'', Texas state appellate court affirms lower court decision finding prohibition on hiring gays and lesbians as police officers unconstitional. 
*''[[State of Idaho v. Holden]]'', 890 P.2d 341 (Idaho Ct. App. 1995)[[Case citation|*]].  A statute prohibiting private consensual oral sodomy between married persons is unconstitutional, because it infringes upon the constitutional right of privacy.

'''Melvin Clark''' (or ''Clarke'') '''George''' (May 13, 1849 – February 22, 1933) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Oregon]].

==Early life==
He was born near [[Caldwell, Ohio]] to Presley and Mahala Nickerson George.&lt;ref name=Corning&gt;{{cite book|last=Corning|first=Howard M|title=Dictionary of Oregon History|publisher=Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his parents over the [[Oregon Trail]] in 1851 and settled on a homestead near [[Lebanon, Oregon|Lebanon]] in [[Linn County, Oregon]]. In Oregon he attended country schools, then [[Santiam Academy]], and finally [[Willamette University]] in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]]. 

He served as principal of the [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] schools and the Jefferson Institute in what would become [[Jefferson, Oregon|Jefferson]].

The '''Millennium Seed Bank Partnership''' (MSBP or MSB), formerly known as the Millennium Seed Bank Project,  is an international [[conservation biology|conservation]] project coordinated by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. After being awarded a [[Millennium Commission]] grant in 1995, the project commenced in 1996, and is now housed in the [[Wellcome Trust]] Millennium Building situated in the grounds of [[Wakehurst Place]], [[West Sussex]]. Its purpose is to provide an "insurance policy" against the [[extinction]] of plants in the wild by storing [[seeds]] for future use. The storage facilities consist of large underground frozen vaults preserving the world's largest wild-plant [[seedbank]] or collection of seeds from wild species. The project had been started by Dr Peter Thompson and run by Paul Smith after the departure of [[Roger Smith (biologist)|Roger Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/conservation-climate-change/millennium-seed-bank/about-the-msb/our-history/index.htm |title=Science and Conservation - Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217014140/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/conservation-climate-change/millennium-seed-bank/about-the-msb/our-history/index.htm |archivedate=17 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Smith was awarded the [[OBE]] in 2000, in the Queen's New Year Honours for services to the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-year-honours-1135267.html |title=NEW YEAR HONOURS |work=The Independent |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with other [[biodiversity]] projects around the world expeditions are sent to collect seeds from [[dryland]] plants. Where possible, collections are kept in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to the Millennium Seed Bank Project for storage. Major partnerships exist on all the continents, enabling the countries involved to meet international objectives such as the [[Global strategy for plant conservation|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation]] and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

The seed bank at Kew has gone through many iterations.  The Kew Seed Bank facility, set up by Peter Thompson in 1980, preceded the MSBP and was headed by Roger Smith from 1980 to 2005. From 2005, Paul Smith took over as head of the MSBP.  The Wellcome Trust Millennium Seed Bank building was designed by the firm [[Stanton WIlliams]] and opened by Prince Charles in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank Millennium Seed Bank Building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719021303/http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank |date=2014-07-19 }} page on website&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratories and offices are in two wings flanking a wide space open to visitors housing an exhibition, and also allowing them to watch the work of cleaning and preparing seeds for storage through the large windows of the work areas. There is also a view down to the entrance to the underground vaults where the seeds are stored at {{cvt|-20|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank-exhibition Millennium Seed Bank Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120403/http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank-exhibition |date=2014-08-26 }} page on website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the international programme of the MSBP was launched.

In April 2007, it banked its [[1000000000 (number)|billionth]] seed,&lt;ref name = billion&gt;Black, Richard [[BBC News]] 2007-04-26 Plant vault passes billion mark [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6593333.stm], accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Oxytenanthera abyssinica'', a type of African bamboo.
In October 2009, it reached its 10% goal of banking all the world's wild plant species by adding ''[[Musa itinerans]]'', a wild [[banana]], to its seed vault. As estimates for the number of seed bearing plant species have increased, 34,088 wild plant species and 1,980,405,036 seeds in storage as of June 2015 represent over 13% of the world's wild plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About {{!}} Millennium Seed Bank Partnership At Kew|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/millennium-seed-bank/about-millennium-seed-bank|access-date=25 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626104051/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/millennium-seed-bank/about-millennium-seed-bank|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project aims==
The main aims of the project&lt;ref name=yearatkew&gt;"A Year at Kew – the Millennium Seed Bank" {{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/seedbank.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526061239/http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/seedbank.html |archivedate=2007-05-26 |df= }} accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; are to:
* Collect the seeds from 75,000 species of plants by 2020, representing 25% of known [[flora]].  This is the second phase of this goal, with the original partnership goal of banking 10% of known flora by 2010 was achieved in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8305456.stm |title=BBC NEWS - Science &amp; Environment - Banana marks seed bank milestone |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collect seeds from all of the UK's native flora.
* Further research into conservation and preservation of seeds and plants.
* Act as a focal point for research in this area and encourage public interest and support.

==International partnerships==
Partnerships exist in Australia, Mexico, [[Chile]], [[Kenya]], China, United States, [[Jordan]], [[Mali]], [[Malawi]], [[Madagascar]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Botswana]], [[Tanzania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Lebanon]] and [[South Africa]]. Australia is particularly significant as its flora constitutes 15% of the world's total of species, with 22% of them identified as under threat of extinction.&lt;ref name=australia&gt;Australian partnership project {{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/msbp/where/Australia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134528/http://www.kew.org/msbp/where/Australia.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }} accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of seeds==
[[File:Pilosella officinarum cleaning.JPG|thumb|A placement student cleaning Pilosella officinarum at the Millennium Seed Bank.  The procedure is being carried out in a dust hood.]]
Seed collections arrive at the MSBP in varying states, sometimes attached to [[fruit]]s, sometimes clean. The collections usually also include a [[Pressed flower craft|voucher specimen]] that can be used to identify the plant.  The collections are immediately moved to a dry room until processing can be conducted where the seeds are cleaned of debris and other plant material, X-rayed, counted, and banked at {{cvt|-20|°C}}. Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with [[Silica gel]] packets impregnated with indicator compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a germination test shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option.

==Seed distribution==
When seeds are required for research purposes they can be requested from the MSBP's seedlist. If it has the legal permission to do so the MSB can then provide up to 60 seeds for free, to bona fide, non-commercial organisations for the purposes of research, restoration, and reintroduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/seedlist/ |title=MSB Seed List — Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seeds provided to institutions are on a [[non-profit]] mutual benefit basis. The MSB also operates the [[UK Native Seed Hub]] which aims to improve the resilience of the UK's ecological networks by providing high quality UK native seeds to conservation and restoration groups.

The study of 'music and emotion' seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]]. It is a branch of [[music psychology]] with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], [[music theory]] and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]].
{{TOC limit}}

==Philosophical approaches==

===Appearance emotionalism ===
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]] and [[Jerrold Levinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/music/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, S. (2005). "Artistic Expression and the Hard Case of Pure Music", in: Kieran, M. (Ed.), ''Contemporary Debates in Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art'': 179-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding [[dynamic structure]] and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 2006, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of [[music psychology]].  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.

===The process theory===
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, Deeper than Reason: Emotion and its Role in Literature, Music, and Art, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 310-13&lt;/ref&gt; assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.

==Conveying emotion through music==
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development.&lt;ref name=Foundations&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=W. J.|title=The development of music perception and cognition|journal=Foundations of Cognitive Psychology: Core Reading|year=2002|pages=481–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref name="Susino and Schubert, 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Susino|first=M.|author2=Schubert, S.|title=Cross-cultural anger communication in music: Towards a stereotype theory of emotion in music|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2017|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |pages=755–788 |chapter=Chapter 27: Cross-cultural similarities and differences | chapterurl=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/me2/uploads/publications/27-Juslin__Sloboda-Ch-27.pdf|isbn=978-0-19-960496-8 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists']] approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. [[Emotivism|Emotivists]] argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherer|first=K. R.|author2=Zentner, M. R.|title=Emotional effects of music: production rules|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=361–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=C.|title=Emotions and music: A reply to the cognitivists|journal=The Journal of Aesthestics and Art Criticism|year=1989|volume=47|pages=69–76|jstor=431994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:

:''Experienced Emotion'' = ''Structural features'' × ''Performance features'' × ''Listener features'' × ''Contextual features''

where:

:''Structural features'' = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
:''Performance features'' = Performer skill × Performer state
:''Listener features'' = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
:''Contextual features'' = Location × Event&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as [[Duration (music)|duration]], [[amplitude]], and [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as [[melody]], [[tempo]] and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Chapter16" /&gt; There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabrielle |first=A. |last2=Stromboli |first2=E. |title=The influence of musical structure on emotional expression |journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research |year=2001 |pages=223–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, [[tempo]] is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as [[mode (music)|mode]], [[loudness]], and [[melody]], also influence the emotional valence of the piece.&lt;ref name="Chapter10"/&gt;

|}

===Performance features===
Performance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

=== Listener features ===
Listener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Contextual features===
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====Conflicting cues====
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=P. G.|author2=Schellenburg, E. G. |author3=Schimmack, U. |title=Feelings and perceptions of happiness and sadness induced by music: Similarities, differences, and mixed emotions|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|pages=47–56|doi=10.1037/a0016873}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;   A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;  The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=J. T.|author2=Stastny, B. J.|title=It's a bittersweet symphony: Simultaneously mixed emotional responses to music with conflicting cues|journal=Emotion|year=2011|doi=10.1037/a0024081|volume=11|pages=1469–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;

===Specific listener features===

====Development====
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloboda|first=J. A.|author2=Juslin, P. N.|title=Psychological perspectives on music and emotion|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=79–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone.&lt;ref name=Nawrot&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nawrot|first=E.

=====''Infants''=====
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that this motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant.&lt;ref name=Trehub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trehub|first=Sandra E.|author2=Nakata, Takayuki|title=Emotion and music in infancy|journal=Musicae Scientiae|year=2001|volume=SPEC ISSUE, 2001-2002|pages=37–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation.&lt;ref name=Trehub /&gt; This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.&lt;ref name=Vist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vist|first=Torill|title=Music Experience in Early Childhood: Potential for Emotion Knowledge?|journal=International Journal of Early Childhood|date=16 November 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=277–290|doi=10.1007/s13158-011-0045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Pre-school children''=====
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults.&lt;ref name=Nawrot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt; However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music.&lt;ref name=Mote /&gt; Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.&lt;ref name=Terwogt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robazza&gt;{{cite journal|last=ROBAZZA|first=CLAUDIO |author2=MACALUSO, CRISTINA |author3=D'URSO, VALENTINA|title=EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO MUSIC BY GENDER, AGE, AND EXPERTISE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|date=1 October 1994|volume=79|issue=2|pages=939–944|doi=10.2466/pms.1994.79.2.939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Elementary-age children''=====
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;  A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid".&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;
Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt; All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.&lt;ref name=Chapter10 /&gt;

====Personality effects====
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training.&lt;ref name=Ladinig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E. Glenn|title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schellenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=E.

K.|author2=Eerola, T.|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings&lt;ref name=Ladinig /&gt;  as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores,&lt;ref name=Schellenberg /&gt; other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kratus|first=J.|title=A Developmental Study of Children's Interpretation of Emotion in Music|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 January 1993|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–19|doi=10.1177/030573569302100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions.&lt;ref name="Policy Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Music, Music Lyrics, and Music Videos on Children and Youth|journal=Pediatrics|date=19 October 2009|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1488–1494|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2145|pmid=19841124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music.&lt;ref name=Robazza /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kratus /&gt;  Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.

==Eliciting emotion through music==
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s).&lt;ref name=Garrido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrido|first=S.|author2=E. Shubert|title=Individual differences in the enjoyment of negative emotion in music: a literature review and experiment|journal=Music Perception|year=2011|volume=28|pages=279–295|doi=10.1525/MP.2011.28.3.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.&lt;ref name=Foundations /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;

===Responses to elicited emotion===
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====''Basic emotions''====
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece.&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.

In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. [[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitivists]] argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;  However, [[Emotivism|emotivists]] purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film.&lt;ref name=Radford /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garrido /&gt; The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [[cognitive reappraisal]], to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement.&lt;ref name="Van den Tol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van den TOl|first=A.J.M.|author2=Edwards, J.|title=Exploring a rationale for choosing to listen to sad music when feeling sad. |journal=Psychology of Music|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits.&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=S. O.|author2=Peynircioglu, Z. F.|title=Intensity of emotions conveyed and elicited by familiar and unfamiliar music|journal=Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal|year=2010|volume=27|pages=177–182|jstor=10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.177|doi=10.1525/MP.2010.27.3.177}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.

====''Emotional memories and actions''====
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Tol, A. J. M., &amp;  Ritchie, T. D.(book-chapter in press). Emotion memory and music: A critical review and recommendations for future research.Music, Memory and Autobiography. (Eds: Professor Strollo Maria Rosaria and Dr. Romano Alessandra).&lt;/ref&gt; Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;  Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van | first1 =  | last2 = den Tol | first2 = A. J.

Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt;

====Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model====

Juslin &amp; Västfjäll&lt;ref&gt;Patrik Juslin &amp; Daniel V ̈astfj ̈all, 'Emotional responses to music: The need to consider underlying mechanisms, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, 2008; 559-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.

''Brain Stem Reflex'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'

''Rhythmic Entrainment'':&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, P. (2011). Music and Emotion: seven questions, seven answers. In I. Deliège, J. Davidson, J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Music and the Mind: Essays in Honour of John Sloboda'' (pp.113-138). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'

''Evaluative Conditioning'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'

''Emotional Contagion'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'

''Visual Imagery'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'

''Episodic memory'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.'&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J. B. (1978). The psychology of music. Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Musical expectancy'': 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'

====Musical expectancy====

With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = P | last2 = Van Tilburg | first2 = W. A. P. | last3 = Van | first3 =  | last4 = den Tol | first4 = A. J. M. | year = 2013 | title = Meaning in music: Deviations from expectation in music polarize in-group and out-group attitudes | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  155–172| doi = 10.1002/ejsp.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA====

In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Juslin | first1 = P. N. | year = 2013 | title = From everyday emotions to aesthetic emotions: towards a unified theory of musical emotions | url = | journal = Physics of Life Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 235–266 | doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2013.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.

==Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions==

===Evidence for emotion in music===
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Self-report''====
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vieillard|first=S.|author2=Peretz, I. |author3=Gosselin, N. |author4=Khalfa, S. |title=Happy, sad, scary, and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2008|volume=4|pages=720–752|doi=10.1080/02699930701503567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt;  Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion.&lt;ref name=Vieillard /&gt; It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;  As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Physiological responses''====
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;   Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt; Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody.&lt;ref name=Chapter19&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gabrielsson|first=A.|title=Emotion in strong experiences with music|journal=Music and Emotion: Theory and Research|year=2001|pages=431–449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

====''Expressive behavior''====
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial [[electromyography]] (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music.&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapter4 /&gt; Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.&lt;ref name=Chapter16 /&gt;

===Strength of effects===
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;  More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;

====''Conveyed more than elicited''====
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt;  Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music.&lt;ref name=Ali /&gt; Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general.&lt;ref name=Hunter2010 /&gt; These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.

====''Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited''====
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.&lt;ref name=Kallenin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallenin|first=K|author2=Ravaja, N.|title=Emotion perceived and emotion felt: Same and different|journal=Musicae Scientaie|year=2006|volume=10|pages=191–213|doi=10.1177/102986490601000203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Elicited more than conveyed''====
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt;  This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed.&lt;ref name=Kallenin /&gt; 
Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.&lt;ref name=Schubert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Emery|title=Locus of emotion: The effect of task order and age on emotion perceived and emotion felt in response to music|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2007|volume=44|issue=4|pages=344–368|doi=10.1093/jmt/44.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zentner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zentner|first=Marcel|author2=Grandjean, Didier |author3=Scherer, Klaus R. |title=Emotions evoked by the sound of music: Characterization, classification, and measurement.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=494–521|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.8.4.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music as a therapeutic tool==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keen MSocSc | first1 = Alexander W. | year = 2005 | title = Using Music as a Therapy Tool to Motivate Troubled Adolescents | url = | journal = Social Work in Health Care | volume = 39 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–373 | doi = 10.1300/J010v39n03_09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Felicity A. | last2 = Gleadhill | first2 = Libby M. | last3 = Dingle | first3 = Genevieve A. | year = 2007 | title = Music therapy and emotional exploration: Exposing substance abuse clients to the experiences of non-drug-induced emotions | url = | journal = The Arts in Psychotherapy | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 321–330 | doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child.&lt;ref name=Robb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robb|first=Sheri L.|title=The effect of therapeutic music interventions on the behavior of hospitalized children in isolation: Developing a contextual support model of music therapy|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118–146|doi=10.1093/jmt/37.2.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
 
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heaton | first1 = Pam | year = 2009 | title = Music - shelter for the frazzled mind?". | url = | journal = The Psychologist | volume = 22 | issue = 12| pages = 1018–1020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">In [[rhetoric]], '''parechesis''' ({{Lang|grc|παρήχησις}}) is the repetition of the same sound in several words in close succession.&lt;ref&gt;Gert J. C. Jordaan -''Ancient Greek Inside Out: The Semantics of Grammatical Constructions - Guide for Exegetes and Students in Classical and New Testament Greek''  2013- Page 171 3643903537 "NT: 1.27 Parechesis (παρήχησις, likeness ofsound) 0 Definition: Parechesis is repetition of the same sound in successive words. It includes alliteration (repetition of the same consonant) and assonance (repetition of the same vowel).&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of a parechesis is: "He persuades the Pithian ({{Lang|grc|πείθει τὸν Πειθίαν}})."&lt;ref&gt;cf. Xen. ''Hist.'' 7.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] discusses parechesis in his work ''On the invention of arguments'' (Περὶ εὑρέσεως).&lt;ref&gt;Herm. ''Inv.'' 4.7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alliteration]] (initial rhyme) is a special case of parechesis. 

It is related to [[paronomasia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Historia Monachorum in Aegypto: Monastic Hagiography in ... 0191075817 Andrew Cain - 2016  "Three types of paronomasia are prevalent in the work: same root (verb) but different inflection;16 same root (verb) but different or added prefix;17 and same root but different derivatives.18 Parechesis is identical to paronomasia except that verbal resonance is achieved through the concurrence of words, similar in sound but dissimilar in sense, which are from different roots..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullinger, E. W. ''Figures of Speech Used in the Bible'' 1970  "In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew thought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And it is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the Hebrew words sounding beside the Greek words."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8974">'''Philosophy education''' is the practice of [[teaching]] and [[learning]] [[philosophy]] along with the associated scholarly research. It is not [[philosophy of education]], nor the philosophical study of education in general.

== Philosophy education around the world ==
Education in the subject is usually divided into 4 main stages: [[pre-school]] (i.e. pre-primary; e.g. [[kindergarten]]) and [[primary education]] levels (e.g. [[elementary school]]), lower (e.g. [[middle school]]) and upper [[secondary education]] level (e.g. [[high school]]), [[Tertiary education|tertiary (higher) education]] level (e.g. [[college]], [[university]]), and [[post-tertiary education]] level. Sometimes the stage referred to as "post-secondary non-tertiary" is also included (in a fashion similar to the [[ISCED]] levels).
Not all countries provide study of philosophy at all levels and in many the subject is virtually absent from the entire curriculum.

=== English-speaking countries ===
In the United States of America, philosophy is not generally taught at the pre-college level. However, through the movements of [[critical thinking]] and [[Philosophy for Children]] aspects of philosophy teaching have entered the curriculum. In recent years, some in the media have promoted the idea of introducing philosophy to American schools as an antidote to perceived political and societal dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/for-a-better-society-teac_b_2356718.html|title=For a Better Society, Teach Philosophy in High Schools|last=Shammas|first=Michael|date=2012-12-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/teaching-philosophy-in-schools-has-huge-impacts-2015-7|title=Schools are starting to teach kids philosophy—and it's completely changing the way students think|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, philosophy is not generally taught in public schools prior to university. In the United Kingdom it is possible to do A-levels in philosophy.

=== Continental Europe ===
In many other European countries philosophy is part of the high school curriculum, such as for example in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], and mainly [[Spain]]. In [[Germany]] the subject ethics has been introduced in more and more parts since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pfister|2010|pp=119–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Croatia the subject ethics can be taken instead of religious education which mainly focuses on Catholic tradition. Spain is the most clear example of a philosophy education. In Secondary school all the students must take a little introduction to ethics, but it is during the sixth form, known there as 'bachillerato', where it is compulsory to take philosophy and citizenship in the first course, as well as history of philosophy in the second course in order to apply for university or just to get the title. University-level philosophy courses are widespread and are usually thought to have the longest tradition in the subject due to the historical ascription for the invention of philosophy as a separate discipline to the philosophers of Ancient Greece.

=== Africa and the Middle East ===
Philosophy education has a long tradition in some of the Arab states. According to a UNESCO-led poll, philosophy is taught at secondary level in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Mauritania, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen. In most Arab countries the subject is taught at university (higher education) level. However, there are exceptions, like Oman and Saudi Arabia, where philosophy is entirely absent at most educational levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=UNESCO Human Security, Democracy and Philosophy Section, Social and Human Sciences Sector  |title=Teaching Philosophy in the Arab Region |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |location=Paris |year=2009 |pages=22, 34–35 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001852/185218e.pdf |format=PDF |id=SHS/PH/2009/PI/ARB 185218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
Philosophy education is traditionally available in most of Asia since the continent gave birth to the schools of [[Eastern philosophy]]. The 20th and early 21st century saw the increased interest in the field (especially in [[Western philosophy]]) in the Asian continent, with [[India]], [[China]] and especially [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/etudesplatoniciennes/283|title=Contemporary Meaning of Reading Plato in Japan and Asia Surtitre|last=Notomi|first=Noburu|date=|website=Open Edition Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as major contemporary academic and research hubs.{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} However, broad regional and interstate differences apply.

=== Latin America ===
In [[Brazil]], philosophy is part of the high school curriculum since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Filosofia e Sociologia no Ensino Médio|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/conselho-nacional-de-educacao/atos-normativos--sumulas-pareceres-e-resolucoes?id=12768|publisher=Ministério da Educação}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches to philosophy education ==
Theoretical questions concerning the teaching of philosophy in school have been debated at least since [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. The modern debate in Germany in the 1970s gave rise to two competing approaches: the more traditional, text-oriented approach by Wulff D. Rehfus and the more modern, dialogue-oriented approach by Ekkehard Martens. Newer approaches have been developed by Karel van der Leeuw and Pieter Mostert as well as Roland W. Henke. A similar divide between [[tradition]]alists and [[modernists]] is to be found in France, with the proponents Jacques Muglioni and Jacqueline Russ on the one side and France Rollin and Michel Tozzi on the other. In Italy, philosophy education is traditionally historically oriented in the sense of [[history of ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pfister|2010|pp=137–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theoretical problems of philosophy education at college and university level are discussed in articles in the journal [[Teaching Philosophy]].

== Didactic methods ==
Among the didactic methods in philosophy are the [[Socratic method]] and [[Hermeneutics]]. The pedagogic side of philosophy teaching is also of note to researchers in the field and philosophers of education.

'''Rabbits and hares are common motifs''' in the [[visual arts]], with variable mythological and artistic meanings in different cultures. The [[rabbit]] as well as the [[hare]] have been associated with [[Lunar deity|moon deities]] and may signify rebirth or resurrection.{{r|Windling}} They may also be symbols of [[fertility]] or sensuality, and they appear in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the [[Labours of the Months]].

In [[Judaism]], the rabbit is considered an unclean animal, because "though it [[ruminant|chews the cud]], does not have a [[Cloven hoof|divided hoof]]."&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 11.6, cf. Deuteronomy 14.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=rock hyrax}} This led to derogatory statements in the Christian art of the Middle Ages, and to an ambiguous interpretation of the [[Three hares#In Judaism|rabbit's symbolism]]. The "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits were a non-[[kosher]] animal in the [[Bible]], positive symbolic connotations were sometimes noted, as for [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Diaspora]].  In any case, a [[three hares]] motif was a prominent part of many [[Synagogue]]s.{{r|Windling}}{{r|Wonnenberg}}

== Antiquity ==
In antiquity, the hare, because it was prized as a hunting quarry, was seen as the epitome of the hunted creature that could survive only by prolific breeding. [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' 3.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Claudius Aelianus]] all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of [[Aphrodite]] and as a gift between lovers. In [[late antiquity]] it was used as a symbol of good luck and in connection with ancient burial traditions.

== Christian art ==
[[File:1505 Piero di Cosimo Venus, Mars and Cupid anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|''Venus, Mars and Cupid'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], a  Cupid lying on Venus clings to a white rabbit.]]
In [[Early Christian art]], hares appeared on [[relief]]s, [[epitaph]]s, icons and oil lamps although their significance is not always clear.

The ''[[Physiologus]]'', a resource for medieval artists, states that when in danger the rabbit seeks safety by climbing high up rocky cliffs, but when running back down, because of its short front legs, it is quickly caught by its predators.&lt;ref&gt;''Physiologus''. Ed. by Ursula Treu. 3rd edition. Hanau 1998. pp. 103-104 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to the teaching of [[St. Basil]], men should seek his salvation in the rock of Christ, rather than descending to seek worldly things and falling into the hands of the [[devil]]. The negative view of the rabbit as an unclean animal, which derived from the [[Old Testament]], always remained present for [[medieval]] artists and their patrons. Thus the rabbit can have a negative connotation of unbridled sexuality and lust or a positive meaning as a symbol of the steep path to salvation. Whether a representation of a hare in Medieval art represents man falling to his doom or striving for his eternal salvation is therefore open to interpretation, depending on context.

[[File:Paderborner Dom Dreihasenfenster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[three hares]] at [[Paderborn Cathedral]]]]

The ''Hasenfenster'' (hare windows) in [[Paderborn Cathedral]] and in the [[Muotathal]] Monastery in Switzerland, in which [[three hares]] are depicted with only three ears between them, forming a triangle, can be seen as a symbol of the [[Trinity]], and probably go back to an old symbol for the passage of time. The three hares shown in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[woodcut]], ''The Holy Family with the Three Hares'' (1497), can also be seen as a symbol of the Trinity.

The idea of rabbits as a symbol of vitality, rebirth and resurrection derives from antiquity. This explains their role in connection with [[Easter]], the [[resurrection of Christ]]. The unusual presentation in Christian iconography of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] playing with a white rabbit in [[Titian]]'s Parisian painting, can thus be interpreted christologically. Together with the basket of bread and wine, a symbol of the sacrificial death of Christ, the picture may be interpreted as the resurrection of Christ after death.

The phenomenon of [[superfetation]], where embryos from different [[menstrual cycle]]s are present in the [[uterus]], results in hares and rabbits being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated, which caused them to be seen as symbols of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, Susan; John Seidensticker (2011). Rabbits: The Animal Answer Guide. JHU Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-9789-0}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits also live underground, an echo of the tomb of Christ.
[[File:Tizian-Madonna mit dem Kaninchen.jpg|thumb|left|168px|[[Titian]], ''Mary and Infant Jesus with a rabbit'', Paris, Louvre]]
As a symbol of fertility, white rabbits appear on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]]. They are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]. [[Martin Schongauer]]'s engraving ''Jesus after the Temptation'' (1470) shows nine (three times three) rabbits at the feet of Jesus Christ, which can be seen as a sign of extreme vitality.  In contrast, the tiny squashed rabbits at the base of the columns in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Rolin Madonna]]'' symbolize "Lust", as part of a set of references in the painting to all the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig. ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', p. 114, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Giovanni Bellini St Jerome Reading in the Countryside.jpg|thumb|right|''St. Jerome Reading in the Countryside'', by [[Giovanni Bellini]], with a white hare.]]
Hunting scenes in the sacred context can be understood as the pursuit of good through evil. In the Romanesque sculpture (c. 1135) in the [[Königslutter]] imperial Cathedral, a hare pursued by a hunter symbolises the human soul seeking to escape persecution by the devil. Another painting, ''Hares Catch the Hunters'', shows the triumph of good over evil. Alternatively, when an eagle pursues the hare, the eagle can be seen as symbolizing Christ and the hare, uncleanliness and the evil's terror in the face of the light.

In Christian [[iconography]], the hare is an attribute of Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint Alberto di Siena, because legend has it that both protected hares from persecution by dogs and hunters. They are also an attribute of the patron saint of Spanish hunters, [[Olegarius]] of Barcelona. White hares and rabbits were sometimes the symbols of chastity and purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunniesinbaskets.org/the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares-by-terri-windling.html|title=the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares|publisher=bunniesinbaskets.org|accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In secular art ==

[[File:Jan Weenix - Een aap en een hond bij dood wild.jpg|thumb|''Hunting still life with lap dog and monkey'' by Jan Weenix, 1714]]

In non-religious art of the modern era, the rabbit appears in the same context as in antiquity: as prey for the hunter, or representing spring or autumn, as well as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of physical love.  In cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]], rabbits frequently appear in the spring months. In [[Francesco del Cossa]]'s painting of April in the [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] in [[Ferrara]], Italy, [[Venus]]' children, surrounded by a flock of white rabbits, symbolize love and fertility.

In [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] art, rabbits are depicted more often than hares. In an [[allegory]] on lust by [[Pisanello]], a naked woman lies on a couch with a rabbit at her feet. [[Pinturicchio]]'s scene of ''[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna in the Bath]]'' is displayed in the Vatican's [[Borgia Apartment]]. Here, each of the two old men are accompanied by a pair of hares or rabbits, clearly indicating wanton lust. In [[Piero di Cosimo]]'s painting of Venus and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], a cupid resting on Venus clings to a white rabbit for similar reasons.

[[Still life]]s in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and their [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish equivalents]] often included a moralizing element which was understood by their original viewers without assistance: fish and meat can allude to religious dietary precepts, fish indicating fasting while great piles of meat indicate ''[[Original sin|voluptas carnis]]'' (lusts of the flesh), especially if lovers are also depicted. Rabbits and birds, perhaps in the company of [[carrot]]s and other [[phallic symbol]]s, were easily understood by contemporary viewers in the same sense.

As small animals with fur, hares and rabbits allowed the artist to showcase his ability in painting this difficult material.  Dead hares appear in the works of the earliest painter of still life collections of foodstuffs in a kitchen setting, [[Frans Snyders]], and remain a common feature, very often sprawling hung up by a rear leg, in the works of [[Jan Fyt]], [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and many other specialists in the genre.  By the end of the 17th century, the grander subgenre of the hunting trophy still life appeared, now set outdoors, as though at the back door of a palace or hunting lodge.  Hares (but rarely rabbits) continued to feature in the works of the Dutch and Flemish originators of the genre, and later French painters like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, William S., "Jean-Baptiste Oudry: Hare and Leg of Lamb", p. 150, ''The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (May, 1970), pp. 149-158
, Cleveland Museum of Art, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25152331 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Middle Ages]] until modern times, the right to hunt was a vigorously defended privilege of the ruling classes. Hunting [[Still life]]s, often in combination with hunting equipment, adorn the rooms of baroque palaces, indicating the rank and prestige of their owners. [[Jan Weenix]]' painting shows a still life reminiscent of a trophy case with birds and small game, fine fruits, a pet dog and a pet monkey, arranged in front of a classicising garden sculpture with the figure of [[Hercules]] and an opulent palace in the background. The wealth and luxurious lifestyle of the patron or owner is clearly shown.
 
The children's tales of the English author [[Beatrix Potter]], illustrated by herself, include several titles featuring the badly behaved [[Peter Rabbit]] and other rabbit characters, including her first and most successful book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' (1902), followed by ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' (1904), and ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'' (1909).  Potter's anthropomorphic clothed rabbits are probably the most familiar artistic rabbits in the English-speaking world, no doubt influenced by illustrations by [[John Tenniel]] of the [[White Rabbit]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

[[Joseph Beuys]], who always finds a place for a rabbit in his works, sees it as symbolizing resurrection. In the context of his action "[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]", he stated that the rabbit "...has a direct relationship to birth... For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation. Because the rabbit shows in reality what man can only show in his thoughts. He buries himself, he buries himself in a depression. He incarnates himself in the earth, and that alone is important."

''[[Masquerade (book)]]'' (1979), written and illustrated by the artist [[Kit Williams]], is ostensibly a children’s book, but contains elaborate clues to the location of a jewelled golden hare, also made by Williams, which he had buried at the location in England to which the clues in the book led.  The hare was not found until 1982, in what later emerged as dubious circumstances.

The Welsh sculptor [[Barry Flanagan]] (1944-2009) was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares, which he produced throughout his career. Many have a comic element, and the length and thinness of the hare's body is often exaggerated.

=== Dürer's ''Young Hare'' ===
{{Anchor|Dürer's hare|reason="Dürer's hare" is the old subsection name, which was changed to "Dürer's ''Young Hare''" on 8 March 2018.}}
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Young Hare]]'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1502)]]
[[File:Wolpertinger.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Wolpertinger]]'' (2005), in the style of Albrecht Dürer]]

Probably one of the most famous depictions of an animal in the history of European art is the painting ''[[Young Hare]]'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]], completed in 1502 and now preserved in the [[Albertina]] in Vienna. Dürer's [[watercolor]] is seen in the context of his other nature studies, such as his almost equally famous ''Meadow'' or his ''Bird Wings''. He chose to paint these in watercolor or [[gouache]], striving for the highest possible precision and "realistic" representation.

The hare pictured by Dürer probably does not have a symbolic meaning, but it does have an exceptional reception history. Reproductions of Dürer's ''Hare'' have often been a permanent component of [[bourgeois]] living rooms in Germany. The image has been printed in textbooks; published in countless reproductions; embossed in copper, wood or stone; represented three-dimensionally in plastic or plaster; encased in [[plexiglas]]; painted on ostrich eggs; printed on plastic bags; surreally distorted in ''Hasengiraffe'' ("Haregiraffe") by Martin Missfeldt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martin-missfeldt.de/kunst-bilder/albrecht-duerer/hase-albrecht-duerer.php|title=Hase nach Albrecht Dürer|website=www.martin-missfeldt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced as a joke by [[Fluxus]] artists;{{r|fluxus}} and cast in gold; or sold cheaply in [[art galleries|galleries]] and at [[art fairs]]

Since early 2000, [[Ottmar Hörl]] has created several works based on Dürer's ''Hare,'' including a giant pink version.&lt;ref name="Hörl’s Pink Hare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=Debbie|title=Pink Rabbit!|url=https://travelwithintent.com/2015/03/26/pink-rabbit-young-hare-vienna/|website=Travel with Intent|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmar Polke]] has also engaged with the hare on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-frieder-burda.de/1.328.2.html?&amp;shadow=79&amp;cHash=93690b7a29|title=Illustration, Gouache on patterned fabric|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in rubber band form.&lt;ref name="Poke rubber band"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Sharon|title=More on Prince, Polke, and rubber bands|url=http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2012/06/more-on-prince-polke-and-rubber-bands.html|website=Two Coats of Paint|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Roth]]'s ''Köttelkarnikel'' ("Turd Bunny") is a copy of Dürer's ''Hare'' made from rabbit droppings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leben.freenet.de/pictureshow/reisen/multimedial-kuenstler-roth_799796_533042_779680_6.html|title=Multimedial: Künstler Roth|website=leben.freenet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Klaus Staeck]] enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a cutout hole, so that it could look out and breathe. Dürer's ''Hare'' has even inspired a depiction of the mythological [[Wolpertinger]].

'''Reactive attachment disorder''' ('''RAD''') is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon [[attachment disorder|disorder]] that can affect children.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"&gt;DSM-IV-TR (2000) [[American Psychiatric Association]] p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Daniel Schechter|Schechter]] DS, Willheim E | title = Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood | journal = Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–86 |date=July 2009 | pmid = 19486844 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 | pmc = 2690512}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts.  It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the "inhibited form". Due to recent revision in the [[DSM-5]] the "disinhibited form" is now considered a separate diagnosis named "[[disinhibited attachment disorder]]".

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of [[neglect]], [[abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent change of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is differentiated from [[pervasive developmental disorder]] or developmental delay and from possibly [[comorbidity|comorbid]] conditions such as [[intellectual disability]], all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment ''disorder'' are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment ''styles'']] such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="prior228"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disorders: assessment strategies and treatment approaches |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=223–44 |year=2003 |pmid=12944216 |doi=10.1080/14616730310001593974 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on [[attachment theory]] and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless "attachment disorder" within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as [[attachment therapy]]. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment ''therapy'', some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be [[wikt: antithetical|antithetical]] to attachment ''theory''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor &amp; Nilsen"&gt;O'Connor TG, Nilsen WJ (2005) "Models versus Metaphors in Translating Attachment Theory to the Clinic and Community".

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Attachment theory| attachment disorder}}
[[Pediatricians]] are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. [[Infant]]s up to about 18–24 months ''may'' present with [[Failure to thrive|non-organic failure to thrive]] and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with [[malnutrition]] or [[dehydration]], while serum [[growth hormone]] levels will be normal or elevated.&lt;ref name=Sad04&gt;{{cite book |title=Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry |last=Sadock |first=BJ |author2=Sadock VA  |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins|location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7817-5033-4 |pages=570–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in three ways:

# Indiscriminate and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult, even relative strangers (older children and adolescents may also aim attempts at peers). This may often times appear as denial of comfort from anyone as well.
# Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.
# Actions that otherwise would be classified as [[conduct disorder]], such as [[Animal abuse|mutilating animals]], [[Sibling abuse|harming siblings]] or other family, or [[Self-harm|harming themselves intentionally]].&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 80. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.&lt;ref name="Rutter 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutter M |title=Nature, nurture, and development: from evangelism through science toward policy and practice |journal=Child Dev |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |year=2002 |pmid=14717240 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria includes symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RICHTERS|first=MARGOT MOSER|last2=VOLKMAR|first2=FRED R.|date=1994-03-01|title=Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709641733|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=33|issue=3|pages=328–332|doi=10.1097/00004583-199403000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment tools===
There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"/&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment,&lt;ref name= "Crittenden 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crittenden PM |title= Quality of attachment in the preschool years|journal= Development and Psychopathology |volume= 4 |issue=02 |pages= 209–41|year= 1992 |url= http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0954579400000110|accessdate= 6 January 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400000110}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment,&lt;ref name="NICHHD"&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |year=1996 |title=Characteristics of infant child care: Factors contributing to positive caregiving |journal=Early Childhood Research Quarterly |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=269–306(38) |doi= 10.1016/S0885-2006(96)90009-5 |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Attachment Q-sort]]&lt;ref name="Waters &amp;amp; Deane 1985"&gt;Waters E, Deane K (1985).

For older children, actual interviews such as the [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|Child Attachment Interview]] and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used.

More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures#Developing methods for older toddlers and children|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] (DAI) developed by Smyke and [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Smyke &amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;Smyke A, Zeanah CH (1999). "Disturbances of Attachment Interview".

It covers 12 items, namely "having a discriminated, preferred adult", "seeking comfort when distressed", "responding to comfort when offered", "social and emotional reciprocity", "emotional regulation", "checking back after venturing away from the care giver", "reticence with unfamiliar adults", "willingness to go off with relative strangers", "self-endangering behavior", "excessive clinging", "vigilance/hypercompliance" and "role reversal". This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.

==Causes==
Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to [[genetic defect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt; reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that types of [[temperament]], or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals  susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=492–502 |doi= 10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |vauthors=Marshall PJ, Fox NA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.&lt;ref name="prior"&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

While similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that the abuse and neglect was far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.&lt;ref name="Zeanah &amp;amp; Fox (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Fox NA |title=Temperament and attachment disorders |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=32–41 |year=2004 |pmid=15028539 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3301_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year [[twin study]], it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of [[psychopathology]], including RAD, [[Borderline Personality Disorder]] (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order [[Emotional dysregulation|self-regulation]] is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the "templates" in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for "re-regulation" (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of "corrective" experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heller SS, Boris NW, Fuselier SH, Page T, Koren-Karie N, Miron D |title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins follow-up: from 18 months to 8 years |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=63–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16581624 |doi=10.1080/14616730600585177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{See also|Attachment measures}}
RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006, p. 80"/&gt; There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.&lt;ref name="prior228"/&gt;

According to the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation.&lt;ref name="AACAP"&gt;[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder Reactive Attachment Disorder.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203213050/http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/reactive_attachment_disorder |date=3 February 2008 }} American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, Facts for Families,  No. 85; Updated December 2002.  Retrieved on 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see  [http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php Reactive Attachment Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228050441/http://dcfswebresource.prairienet.org/resources/rad.php |date=28 December 2007 }}, DCFS, State of Illinois and [http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/attach.pdf DBHS Practice Protocol: Disturbances and Disorders of Attachment] (PDF), Arizona Department of Health Services, 2 October 2006. Retrieved on 2008-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[British Association for Adoption and Fostering]] (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child’s individual and family history.&lt;ref name="BAAF"&gt;[http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf Attachment Disorders, their Assessment and Intervention/Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002051146/http://www.baaf.org.uk/about/believes/ps4.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }} (PDF).

According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
ICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
* markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts (e.g., the child is avoidant or unresponsive to care when offered by caregivers or is indiscriminately affectionate with strangers);&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;
* the disturbance is not accounted for solely by [[Child development|developmental]] delay and does not meet the criteria for [[pervasive developmental disorder]];
* onset before five years of age (there is no age specified before five years of age at which RAD cannot be diagnosed);&lt;ref name=DSMIV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Text Revision|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-025-6|pages=943}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a history of significant neglect;
* an implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.

ICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of "[[pathogenic]] care" defined as persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is the child's history of care rather than observation of symptoms.

In DSM-IV-TR the ''inhibited'' form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour).&lt;ref name= "DSM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th ed., text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 313.89 Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood  |publisher= AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PRESS INC (DC) |location= United States}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The ''disinhibited'' form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures).&lt;ref name ="DSM"/&gt; There is therefore a lack of "specificity" of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.

The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:
* [[Child abuse|abuse]], ([[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or physical), in addition to neglect;
* associated emotional disturbance;
* poor social interaction with peers, aggression towards self and others, misery, and growth failure in some cases (inhibited form only);
* evidence of capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness as shown by elements of normal social relatedness in interactions with appropriately responsive, non-deviant adults (disinhibited form only).

The first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; ICD-10 states the disinhibited form "tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances". Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision.&lt;ref name="WHO1992"&gt;World Health Organisation (1992) ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)''. Geneva: World health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zilberstein K | year = 2006 | title = Clarifying core characteristics of attachment disorders | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]] | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 55–64 | doi=10.1037/0002-9432.76.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V.&lt;ref name=DSM-V&gt;Proposed Revision Reactive Attachment Disorder, ''American Psychiatric Association'' (2012). Retrieved from http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=120&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as ''Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood''.&lt;ref name=DSMIV /&gt;

In regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.&lt;ref name=DSM-V /&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained [[mental health]] expert with particular expertise in [[differential diagnosis]] is considered essential.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanson RF, Spratt EG |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder: what we know about the disorder and implications for treatment |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=137–45 |year=2000 |pmid=11232086 |doi=10.1177/1077559500005002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980109603678 |author=Wilson SL |title=Attachment disorders: review and current status |journal=J Psychol |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=37–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11235838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Several other disorders, such as [[conduct disorder]]s, [[oppositional defiant disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[post traumatic stress disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as [[autism spectrum|autism]], [[pervasive developmental disorder]], [[pediatric schizophrenia|childhood schizophrenia]] and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt; Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson (2001)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

===Alternative diagnosis===
In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD]], were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as [[attachment therapy]]. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, [[Externalization|externalizing]] behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.&lt;ref name="Gutman-Steinmetz &amp;amp; Crowell (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guttmann-Steinmetz S, Crowell JA |title=Attachment and externalizing disorders: a developmental psychopathology perspective |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=440–51 |year=2006 |pmid=16601649 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000196422.42599.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others.&lt;ref name="Randolph 1996"&gt;Randolph, Elizabeth Marie. (1996). ''Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire''. Institute for Attachment, Evergreen CO.&lt;/ref&gt; The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties.

==Treatment==
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)|Attachment therapy}}
Assessing the child's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, [[family therapy]], individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment&lt;ref name=Sad04/&gt;

In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=November 2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title= Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |last1=Boris |first1=Neil W. |last2=Zeanah |first2=Charles H. |author3=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(09)62229-2/fulltext |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:
# "The most important intervention for young children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and who lack an attachment to a discriminated caregiver is for the clinician to advocate for providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure."
# "Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder is based on symptoms displayed by the child, assessing the caregiver's attitudes toward and perceptions about the child is important for treatment selection."
# "Children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. After ensuring that the child is in a safe and stable placement, effective attachment treatment must focus on creating positive interactions with caregivers."

Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.''

===Attachment therapy===
{{main|Attachment therapy}}

The terms [[attachment disorder]], attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaffin|first=Mark|last2=Hanson|first2=Rochelle|last3=Saunders|first3=Benjamin E.|last4=Nichols|first4=Todd|last5=Barnett|first5=Douglas|last6=Zeanah|first6=Charles|last7=Berliner|first7=Lucy|last8=Egeland|first8=Byron|last9=Newman|first9=Elana|date=2006-02-01|title=Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment Therapy, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems|url=http://cmx.sagepub.com/content/11/1/76|journal=Child Maltreatment|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=76–89|doi=10.1177/1077559505283699|issn=1077-5595|pmid=16382093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the mainstream programs is a [[Attachment therapy#Treatment characteristics|form of treatment]] generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These "attachment disorders" use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different to criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Sufferers of "attachment disorder" are said to lack empathy and remorse.

Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref name="Chaffin 2006 pp. 79"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), pp. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 85. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; There is little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]] and techniques vary from non-coercive [[Therapy|therapeutic]] work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the [[Evergreen model]]. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.''

==Prognosis==
The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TG, Rutter M |title=Attachment disorder behavior following early severe deprivation: extension and longitudinal follow-up.

(2006)"/&gt; Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers.

Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.&lt;ref name="Roy ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roy P, Rutter M, Pickles A |year=2004 |title=Institutional care: Associations between overactivity and lack of selectivity in social relationships|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=866–73  |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00278.x |pmid=15056316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements.&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinshaw-Fuselier|first1=Sarah|last2=Boris|first2=Neil W.|last3=Zeanah|first3=Charles H.|title=Reactive attachment disorder in maltreated twins|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=20|issue=1| year=1999| pages=42–59|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;42::AID-IMHJ4&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.

In the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors—a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within "secure base distortion", (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child's "internal working models". The twins' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as "quite concerning". The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The [[Attachment measures#Other approaches|narrative measures]] used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.&lt;ref name="Heller ''et al.'' (2006)"/&gt;

One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on [[Self monitoring|self-monitoring]] (regulating your behavior to "look good"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.&lt;ref name="Hall &amp;amp; Geher (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980309600605 |vauthors=Hall SE, Geher G |title=Behavioral and personality characteristics of children with reactive attachment disorder|journal=J Psychol |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=145–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12735525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Epidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR 2000 p. 129"/&gt; The [[prevalence]] of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages.&lt;ref name="prior" /&gt; There is little systematically gathered [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] information on RAD.&lt;ref name="Hanson&amp;Spratt2000"/&gt; A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Skovgaard AM, Houmann T, Christiansen E, etal |year=2007 |title= The prevalence of mental health problems in children 1½ years of age&amp;nbsp;– the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 |journal= J Child Psychol Psychiatry  |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=62–70 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01659.x |pmid= 17244271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there.&lt;ref name="Chisholm ''et al.''

A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.&lt;ref name="Smyke ''et al.''(2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smyke AT, Dumitrescu A, Zeanah CH |title=Attachment disturbances in young children.

There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.''(2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Hinshaw-Fuselier SS, Smyke AT, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS, Zeanah CH |title=Comparing criteria for attachment disorders: establishing reliability and validity in high-risk samples |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=568–77 |year=2004 |pmid=15100563 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200405000-00010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in ''maltreated'' rather than ''neglected'' toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors.&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;Chaffin ''et al.''

The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt; Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties.&lt;ref name="dsm"&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994, as discussed in Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders.&lt;ref name="dsm"/&gt; [[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] is a common and normal human characteristic.&lt;ref name="Bonanno"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bonanno GA|year=2004 |title=Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events? |format=PDF |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/bem/behavhealth/documents/loss_trauma.pdf|accessdate=26 January 2008 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.20 |pmid=14736317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in [[foster care|foster children]], [[adoption|adoptive children]], or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;

There are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD.&lt;ref name="taskforce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinshaw-Fusilier ''et al.'' (1999)"/&gt; Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Connor &amp;amp; Rutter (2000)"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Attachment theory|Attachment in children}}
Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard [[nosology|nosologies]] of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with [[failure to thrive]]. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.&lt;ref name="Zean96"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeanah CH |title=Beyond insecurity: a reconceptualization of attachment disorders of infancy |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=42–52 |year=1996 |pmid=8907083 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.64.1.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is [[attachment theory]], based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by [[John Bowlby]], [[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[René Spitz]]. Attachment theory is a framework that employs [[Psychology|psychological]], [[Ethology|ethological]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to ''seek proximity'' to a ''particular attachment figure'' (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress,  behavior which appears to have survival value.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment [[Human behavior|behaviors]] tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. [[Attachment in children|Infants become attached to adults]] who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) pp. 313–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name=" Bretherton &amp;amp; Munholland 1999"&gt;Bretherton I, Munholland KA (1999). "Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited". In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 89–111. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby  [1969] (1997 edition) p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.

The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as ''styles'' or ''patterns''. There are four attachment [[Attachment in children#Attachment patterns|styles]] ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all ''organized'')&lt;ref name="Ainsworth et al. (1979)"&gt;Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S (1979). ''Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation.'' Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''disorganized''.&lt;ref name="Main &amp; Solomon (1986)"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1986). "Discovery of an insecure disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern: procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior". In Brazelton TB and Yogman M (Eds.) ''Affective development in infancy'', pp. 95–124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex {{ISBN|0-89391-345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Main &amp;amp; Solomon 1990"&gt;Main M, Solomon J (1990). "Procedures for identifying infants as disorganized/disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation". In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 121–60. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three are characterised as ''insecure''. These are assessed using the [[Attachment measures#Measuring attachment in children|Strange Situation Procedure]], designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt;

A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"/&gt;

Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Dev |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145–52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00128 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A [[disease|disorder]] in the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005/&gt; Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.&lt;ref name="O'Con '02"&gt;O’Connor TG (2002), "Attachment disorders in infancy and childhood". In Rutter M, Taylor E, (Eds.) ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Modern Approaches'' (4th  ed.) Blackwell Scientific publications. pp. 776–792. {{ISBN|0-632-01229-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term "attachment disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 77. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications.&lt;ref name="Zean96"/&gt; It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' (2006), p. 82–83. The APSAC Taskforce Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD.&lt;ref name="Boris ''et al.'' 1996)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH, Larrieu JA, Scheeringa MS, Heller SS |title=Attachment disorders in infancy and early childhood: a preliminary investigation of diagnostic criteria|journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=295–97 |date=1 February 1998|pmid=9464217|doi=10.1176/ajp.155.2.295|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9464217 |accessdate=31 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zeanah CH, Scheeringa M, Boris N, Heller S, Smyke A, Trapani J |date=August 2004 |title=Reactive Attachment Disorder in Maltreated Toddlers  |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect: the International Journal |volume=28 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.010 |pages=877–88 |pmid=15350771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by [[C.H. Zeanah]] and N. Boris. The first of these is ''disorder of attachment,'' in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is ''secure base distortion'', where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is ''disrupted attachment''. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed.&lt;ref name="Boris &amp;amp; Zeanah (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |year=1999 |title= Disturbance and disorders of attachment in infancy: An overview|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal |volume=20|pages=1–9 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0355(199921)20:1&lt;1::AID-IMHJ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required.&lt;ref name="oconzean2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeanah 2000"&gt;Zeanah CH (2000). "Disturbances and disorders of attachment in early childhood". In Zeanah CH (Ed.) ''Handbook of infant mental health'' (2nd ed.) pp. 358–62. New York: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-171-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665–687.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn M, Bakermans-Kranenburg M |date=September 2003 |title=Attachment disorders and disorganized attachment: Similar and different |journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=313–20(8) |doi= 10.1080/14616730310001593938 |pmid=12944229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg 1999"&gt;Greenberg MT (1999). ''Attachment and Psychopathology in Childhood.'' In Cassidy J and Shaver PR (Eds.) ''Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications.'' pp. 469–96. Guilford Press {{ISBN|1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work by C.H. Zeanah&lt;ref name="Zeanah et al. (2004)"/&gt; indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.&lt;ref name= "Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990)"&gt;Main M, Hesse E (1990) "Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infants' insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment status: Is frightened or frightening behavior the linking mechanism?" In Greenberg M, Cicchetti D and Cummings E (Eds.) ''Attachment in the preschool years: Theory, research and intervention'', pp. 161–182 Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-30630-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-V Proposed Draft.

{{citation style|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], a '''schema''' (plural ''schemata'' or ''schemas'') describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = P | year = 1997 | title = Culture and cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 263–287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadkarni | first1 = S. | last2 = Narayanan | first2 = V. K. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic schemas, strategic flexibility, and firm performance: The moderating role of industry clockspeed | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 243–270 | doi = 10.1002/smj.576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" /&gt;

People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include [[Rubric (academic)|academic rubrics]], [[Social cognition#Social schemas|social schemas]], stereotypes, [[social role]]s, [[Behavioral script|scripts]], [[worldview]]s, and [[archetype]]s. In [[Piaget's theory]] of development, children construct a series of schemata, based on the interactions they experience, to help them understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgeon | first1 = O.R. | last2 = Ritter | first2 = F.E. | year = 2011 | title = An intrinsically motivated schema mechanism to model and simulate emergent cognition | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.07.003 | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 15–16 | issue = | page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before psychology separated from philosophy, the term "schema" was prominently discussed in philosophy by [[Schema (Kant)|Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nevid | first1 = J. S. | year = 2007 | title = Kant, cognitive psychotherapy, and the hardening of the categories | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 605–615 | doi = 10.1348/147608307X204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] and [[Jean Piaget]]: the term "schema" was introduced by Piaget in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1923). {{cite web|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP23_Langag_pensee_chap1_fonctionslang.pdf|title=Langage et pensée chez l'enfant}} (3e éd. 1948 revue et avec un nouvel avant-propos et un nouveau chapitre II inséré  utgave  bind). Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, p. 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was popularized in psychology and education through the work of the British psychologist [[Frederic Bartlett]],&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bartlett |first=F.C. |year=1932 |title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who drew on the term [[body schema]] used by neurologist [[Henry Head]]. It was expanded into schema theory by educational psychologist Richard C. Anderson.&lt;ref name=lingualinks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ImplementALiteracyProgram/SchemaTheoryOfLearning.htm|title=Schema theory of learning|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|date=2 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other terms have been used to describe schema such as "frame", "scene" and "script".

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a [[heuristic]] technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleider | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Pezdek | first2 = K. | last3 = Goldinger | first3 = S. D. | last4 = Kirk | first4 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Schema-driven source misattribution errors: Remembering the expected from a witnessed event | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi = 10.1002/acp.1361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information ([[proactive interference]]), such as when existing [[stereotype]]s, giving rise to limited or [[bias]]ed discourses and expectations ([[prejudice]]s), lead an individual to "see" or "remember" something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = M. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = N. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of schemas, stimulus ambiguity, and interview schedule on eyewitness memory over time | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 101–118 | doi = 10.1037/1076-898X.9.2.101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to "remember" the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See {{section link||Background research}} below.)

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Which schema is selected can depend on factors such as current activation, accessibility, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and emotion.

''Accessibility'' is how easily a schema comes to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut; it allows the [[availability heuristic|most common explanation to be chosen for new information]].

With priming, a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of [[subliminal message]]s, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the [[mere exposure effect]]—which requires consciousness of the stimuli—is far more effective than priming.

==Background research==
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by Bartlett.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; By presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations and then monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc.), Bartlett was able to establish that individuals' existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret "schema-foreign" new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, "The War of the Ghosts", and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:
* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be "padded out" and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett's work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor immutable but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. In a sense it supports the [[existentialism|existentialist]] view that people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment, and that much of what people "remember" is actually confabulated (adjusted and rationalized) narrative that allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable at any given time.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E. (1980) [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4 Schemata: the building blocks of cognition]. In: R.J. Spiro et al. (Eds) Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. See also: Mandler, J. M. (1984). Stories, scripts, and scenes: Aspects of schema theory. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its erroneous recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Treyens | first2 = J. C. | title = Role of schemata in memory for places | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages= 207–230 | year = 1981 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90008-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic's study and were later asked about the room's contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants' expectations that books are present in academics' studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=The Psychology of Computer Vision|editor=Patrick H. Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, [[David Rumelhart]] extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the [[mental representation]] of complex knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|title=Schemata: The Building Blocks of Cognition|year=1980|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|edition=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Rodger C.|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Abelson|first2=Robert P.|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual's schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their [[worldview]]. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Crocker, J. (1981). Schematic bases of social information processing. In E. T. Higgins, C. A. Herman, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), Social cognition: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology (pp. 89-134). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen on a deep level— frequently an individual does not become conscious of or even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of [[disconfirmation bias]], the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations.&lt;ref name="taberandlodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taber | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Lodge | first2 = Milton | title = Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs | journal = American Journal of Political Science | publisher = Midwest Political Science Association | volume = 50 | number = 3 | pages= 755–769 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x | issn = 0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Chris S. | last2 = Durso | first2 = Francis T. | year = 1984 | title = Effect of schema-incongruent information on memory for stereotypical attributes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | pmid = 6747816 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema. Accommodation usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Studies in Reflection Abstraction|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Sussex|isbn=1-84169-157-7|editor=Robert L. Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says "chickens with red feathers can lay eggs". This schemata will then be either changed or removed, in the future.

[[Assimilation (psychology)|Assimilation]] is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. An example would be, when an unfamiliar dog is seen, a person will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that doesn't seem dog-like, there will be [[Accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]] as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With Accommodation and Assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into existing schema this is called disequilibrium and this is an unpleasant state for the child's development. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the child remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S. A|title=Jean Piaget {{!}} Cognitive Theory|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-schema==
{{Main|Self-schema}}
Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one's self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and selectively ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = J. D. | year = 2000 | title = On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 906–92 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 | pmid=11138760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanitioso | first1 = R. | last2 = Kunda | first2 = Z. | last3 = Fong | first3 = G. T. | year = 1990 | title = Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 229–41 | pmid = 2213492 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, memories may even be distorted to become more favorable, for example, people typically remember exam grades as having been better than they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bahrick | first1 = Harry P | last2 = Hall | first2 = Lynda K | last3 = Berger | first3 = Stephanie A | year = 1996 | title = Accuracy and Distortion in Memory for High School Grades | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 265–271 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00372.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when people have negative self views, memories are generally biased in ways that validate the negative self-schema; people with low self-esteem, for instance, are prone to remember more negative information about themselves than positive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Story | first1 = A. L. | year = 1998 | title = Self-esteem and memory for favorable and unfavorable personality feedback | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | doi=10.1177/0146167298241004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent's pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swann | first1 = W. B. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Pelham | first3 = B. W. | year = 2002 | title = Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates | url = | journal = Journal of Self and Identity | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 219–233 | doi=10.1080/152988602760124856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of self-verification.

As researched by [[Aaron T. Beck|Aaron Beck]], automatically-activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–449 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url= http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate= |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: "If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine." This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Glossary|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Self-Schema|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schema therapy==
{{Main article|Schema therapy|List of maladaptive schemas}}
Schema therapy was founded by [[Jeffrey Young]] and represents a development of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) specifically for treating [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. E. (1999) Cognitive therapy for personality disorders: A schema-focused approach. (rev ed.) Sarasota, FL: Professional Resources Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Klosko &amp; Weishaar (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vScjGGgJEZgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Schema Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide]. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Early maladaptive schemata'' are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one's relationships with others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[object relations]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] and [[psychoanalytic]] therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy is the latter "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on [[Schema therapy#Limited reparenting|limited reparenting]]".&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffery|title=Schema Therapy|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310804.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be [[eating disorder]]s and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham
|first = Jeremy
|authorlink = 
|title = An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
|publisher = Methuen
|series =  
|year = 1780
|doi = 
|isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

[[File:Abbé pratiquant la simonie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Abbot practising simony (France, 12th century)]]
'''Simony''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}} is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after [[Simon Magus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932, "Simon."&lt;/ref&gt; who is described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9–24 as having offered two disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] to anyone on whom he would [[Laying on of hands|place his hands]].  The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1880)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt; Simony was one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

==History==
===Catholic Church===
Although an offense against [[canon law]], Simony became widespread in the [[Catholic Church]] in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the canon law, the word bears a more extended meaning than in [[English law]]. ''Simony according to the canonists'', says [[John Ayliffe]] in his ''[[John Ayliffe#Works|Parergon]]'',
{{quote|"...is defined to be a deliberate act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual, or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is temporal."}}

[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal Marco Corner investing Marco, abbot of Carrara, with his benefice, [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' the Decretum&lt;ref&gt;Pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decretals&lt;ref&gt;Bk. v. tit. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; deal with the subject. The offender whether ''simoniacus'' (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or ''simoniace promotus'' (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a [[Secular clergy|secular priest]], or to confinement in a stricter [[monastery]] if a [[Regular clergy|regular]]. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent ''simoniace promotus'' was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.{{clarify|date=August 2013}}

Certain matters were simoniacal by the [[canon law]] but would not be regarded as such in English law.{{efn|For example, the sale of [[tithes]], the taking of a fee for [[Confession (religion)|confession]], absolution, marriage or burial, the concealment of one in [[mortal sin]] or the reconcilement of an impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing of [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for spiritualities.}} So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons (deprived of citizens' rights due to conviction) could accuse another of it. English provincial and [[legatine]] constitutions continually assailed simony.

===Church of England===
The [[Church of England]] struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of [[English law]], simony is defined by [[William Blackstone]] as "obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol I|date=1765|pages=376–7|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more narrowly, "the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical [[benefice]] for gift or reward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol IV|date=1769|page=62|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[English and Welsh law|English law]] recognized simony as an offence,&lt;ref&gt;'''3''' ''[[Edward Coke|Coke's Institutes]]'' 153–156&lt;/ref&gt; it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both [[Edward VI of England]] and [[Elizabeth I]] promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the [[Simony Act 1588]].  The cases of [[Bishop of St. David's]] [[Thomas Watson (Bishop of St David's)|Thomas Watson]] in 1699&lt;ref&gt;Handley, S. (2004) "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28868 Watson, Thomas (1637–1717)]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 21 August 2007 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Dean of York]] [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William Cockburn]] in 1841 were particularly notable.&lt;ref name="times410410"&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 1841, p.6 col.b, reprinted from the ''Cambridge Advertiser''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Benefice]]s Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a [[benefice]], and in resignation of a [[benefice]]. The [[common law]] (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of [[the Crown]]) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

{{As of|2011}}, simony remains an offence.&lt;ref name="halsbury832"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''832'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"&gt;''Halsbury'' '''1359'''&lt;/ref&gt; An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by [[the Crown]], and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simony Act 1588]], s.4&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on [[ordination]], but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;2003 No.3&lt;/ref&gt; r.8.&lt;ref name="halsbury1359"/&gt;

Stand-up tragedy performances are usually long and employ the use of various media such as video, audio, highly emotional monologues and rants where the performer recites a fast-paced succession of tragic and disturbing stories.

'''Sustainable landscape architecture''' is a category of [[sustainable design]] concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space.&lt;ref name=nytimes_landscape&gt;{{cite web|last=Orr|first=Stephen|title=A Sustainability That Aims to Seduce|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/garden/21sustainable.html?pagewanted=all&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=cserbias%3Aw%2C[%22RI%3A1%22%2C%22RI%3A3%22]&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FSustainable%2Blandscape%2Barchitecture%2F|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This can include ecological, politically correct, social and economic aspects of sustainability. For example, the design of a [[Sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage system]] can: improve habitats for [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; improve recreational facilities, because people love to be beside water; save money, because building culverts is expensive and floods cause severe financial harm.

The design of a [[green roof]] or a [[roof garden]] can also contribute to the sustainability of a [[landscape architecture]] project. The roof will help manage surface water, provide for [[wildlife]] and provide for [[recreation]].

Sustainability appears to be a new addition to the traditional [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] objectives of the design process: a structure must be solid, useful, and beautiful (''firmitas'', ''utilitas'', ''venustas''). But it can be seen as an aspect of both solidity and usefulness: an outdoor space is likely to last longer and give more usefulness to its owners if it requires low inputs of energy, water, fertiliser etc., and if it produces fewer outputs of noise, [[pollution]], [[surface water runoff]] etc.

'''Tomb of Ferdowsi''' ({{lang-fa|آرامگاه فردوسی}}) is a tomb complex composed of a white marble base, and a decorative edifice erected in honor of the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Ferdowsi]] located in [[Tus, Iran]], in [[Razavi Khorasan province]]. It was built in the early 1930s,&lt;ref name=r&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ferdowsi-iii |title=Ferdowsi, Abul-qasem. Mausoleum|last=A. Shahpur|first=Shahbazi|publisher=Columbia University |date=Dec 15, 1999&lt;!-- - 2012 upt.--&gt;|website=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Reza Shah]], and uses mainly elements of [[Achaemenid architecture]] to demonstrate Iran's rich culture and history. The construction of the mausoleum as well as its aesthetic design is a reflection of the cultural, and geo-political status of [[Iran]] at the time.

==Background==
[[Ferdowsi]], the influential [[Persian language|Persian]] poet and author of the Persian epic, [[Shahnameh]] died in 1020{{nbsp}}AD in the [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Iran]] (Persia), in the same city in which he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poetics and Politics of Iran's National Epic, the Shahnameh |author=Mahmoud Omidsalar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=Nov 2011|pages=52–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQrIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+died+at&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpEzU5aiBYfx0gG694GQDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20died%20at&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all his literary contribution, Ferdowsi was not recognized during his life. It was only after his death that his poems won him admiration. For hundreds of years, his resting place was nothing more than a minor dome-shrine erected by a [[Ghaznavid]] ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], without any permanent edifice in place in the garden of his house where Ferdowsi's daughter had originally buried him.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; In the beginning years of the 20th{{nbsp}}century [[Iran]] started to realize his critical role in defining the [[National symbols of Iran|identity of Iran]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;{{cite book|title=A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited|author=Rami Yelda|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Kbj21wrwwEC&amp;pg=PT168&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZUzU6_QHKixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1934 that the Iranian government, then under the control of [[Reza Shah]], first king of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], recognized the cultural and literary value of Ferdowsi and erected a permanent tomb in his honor.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; A [[Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration|millennial celebration]] was also held for the poet, to which were invited scholars from several countries, including [[Soviet Tajikistan]], [[India]], [[Armenia]], and [[Europe]] ([[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[France]], [[U.K.|England]]). Funds were collected, mainly donations from [[Parsi]] scholars, to enable the building of a [[statue]] for the poet at his tomb site.{{clarification needed|date=June 2015}} The Pahlavi family used Ferdowsi to advance Iran's cultural prestige, but in doing so nearly cost Ferdowsi his tomb since, after the [[Islamic revolution]], frustrations with the [[Shah of Iran]] nearly led to destruction of the tomb by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drinking Arak Off a [cleric]'s Beard: A Journey Through the Inside-Out Worlds of Iran and Afghanistan|author=Nicholas Jubber|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010|pages=61–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DblrRc7mCmsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=islamic+revolution+ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H6UzU4jTDJOqsQSIy4CwCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20revolution%20ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Panorama of Ferdowsi's tomb, [[Tus, Iran]]]]
The tomb was originally designed by the Iranian [[architect]], [[Haj Hossein Lurzadeh]] who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 [[mosque]]s, as well as the private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in [[Tehran]], the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine]] in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=s4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|author=Habibollah Ayatollahi|publisher=Alhoda UK|year=2003|pages=291–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Haj+Hossein+Lurzadeh+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AqgzU6qeBubUsAS0mYCYBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Haj%20Hossein%20Lurzadeh%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present design of the structure is credited mainly to [[Karim Taherzadeh]], who replaced the old dome-shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalizing Iran: culture, power, and the state, 1870–1940|author=Afshin Marashi|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2011|pages=126–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=488CSG25AzcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=tomb+of+ferdowsi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hr40U4e1AvK-sQSbwIKwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20ferdowsi%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdowsi's tomb, which resembles the [[tomb of Cyrus the Great]], is built in style of [[Achaemenid architecture]]. There is a clear link between this choice of architectural style and the politics of Iran at the time. Four years before Reza Shah came to power in 1922, a group of secular Iranian reformists had created the "[[Society for the National Heritage of Iran|Society for National Heritage]]" (SNH, or in Persian ''anjoman-e asar-e meli'').&lt;ref name=s3&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author=Bianca Devos, Christoph Werner|publisher=Routledge|date=Aug 22, 2013|pages=101–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=architectural+element+of+tomb+of+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqszU72vJqixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=architectural%20element%20of%20tomb%20of%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mostly of western-educated, pro-reform intellectuals such as [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], [[Hassan Pirnia]], [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek]], [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], Firuz Mirza Firus Nosrat al-Dowleh, and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]], the SNH was critical in obtaining the funds from the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Keikhosrow Shahrokh, Iran's [[Zoroastrian]] representative to the Iranian parliament, was particularly active in reviving Achaemenid and [[Sassanid architecture]] in Iran in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Architectural Conservation|author=Jukka Jokilehto|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|section=9.1.5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UandAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT505&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ar4zU8P-MdHMsQSyx4GoBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural Details==

The basic structure of the tomb is rectangular with a large garden surrounding the structure and interacting with the structure in the [[Persian gardens|Persian style of gardening]] known as [[Charbagh|Char-bagh]] (or Chaharbagh translating to ''four gardens'' in Persian). In the center of the cross created by the legs of the garden surrounding it, is an edifice made of primarily white [[marble]]. The edifice can be divided into a "wide chamber" that lies at the base and a cubical erection on top, with four pillars surrounding it and scenes from the epic of Shahnameh and text ornating it. The body of the poet is actually interred in the center of the rectangular wide chamber underneath the overlying four [[Column|pillars]] cube.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; There are twelve (12) steps leading from the lowest point of the wide chamber all the way to the level of the cube. The wide base has a total height of 16 m. The edifice has equal dimensions of 30 m on each side.

The following are schematic diagrams of the aerial view of the tomb's wide base and edifice section and their topography:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A unique feature of the design of Ferdowsi's tomb has been its resemblance to that of Cyrus the Great in [[Pasargadae]]. Cyrus's tomb also has a rectangular structure seating atop a rectangular, gradually elevating base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author=James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=tomb+of+cyrus+dimensions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RVo7TZf-HYGBlAeEioXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20cyrus%20dimensions&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resemblance is intentional as the designer of this edifice intended to revoke the original Achaemenid style of architecture. In fact every other facet of the edifice has a Zoroastrian symbol known as [[Faravahar]]. This is not coincidental. There are multiple applications of this in the [[Achaemenid architecture]] mainly in [[Persepolis]] in [[Fars province]] today. The "Society for National Heritage of Iran" (SNH) heavily relied on the use of Faravahar as this was the symbolic representation of [[ancient Iran]] since Achaemenid times.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Many construction in the 1930s, including the then [[National Bank of Iran]] use Faravahar which is not unexpected considering that the same architect that created Ferdowsi's tomb also created the National Bank of Iran.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A closer look at the edifice points out that there are four columns each at the corner of the rectangular structure with two half-buried columns that protrude as deep [[friezes]] on each facet of the structure. Each frieze column has a box, followed by a two horn bull sign which is very much similar if not the exact imitation of the Persepolis column design. The columns are ornated with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]] 3/4 of the way down with the last portion spared. The overall effect is intended to create a grand gesture. The columns are as high as the edifice which is 30 meters high. (the edifice is also 30 m wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.where-is-iran.com/Historical-Monument-In-Iran/Tombs-Khorassan-Razavi-Iran.aspx |title=Ferdowsi Tomb, Toos-Khorasan-Iran |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= Where is Iran |publisher= |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble decorations are used to ornate the siding and the floor of the "wide base" structure as well the wall. Persian flower designs (concentric flower designs composed of a flower with seven (7) ovaloid pellets surrounding a central circle), and hexagonal marble designs are commonly used in the structure.

==Historical Context==
[[File:Rpferdosi.jpg|thumb|right|Reza Shah Pahlavi officially opening the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting upon conclusion of Ferdowi Millenary conference]]
[[Iran]]'s history has been closely tied to geopolitical changes that has taken place since the establishment of the [[Achaemenid empire]] in [[Persis]] all the way to the modern day Iran. Two major events are of critical importance in Iran's history specially its literary history as it pertained to Ferdowsi: [[Arab conquest of Persia]] and the [[Mongolia]]n invasion of Persia.

Ferdowsi lived his life as a poor man constantly moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], at one point was an opulent city in the [[greater Khorasan]] region but it was repeatedly sacked by [[Oguz Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Uzbeks]] from the steppe.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; This and the growing influence of [[Mashad]] as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of [[Middle Persian]] being lost in favor of [[Arabic]]. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the least number of loan-words he transferred the [[Middle Persian]] (Pahlavi) into Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] (Farsi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind|first=Michael |last=Axworthy|authorlink=Michael Axworthy|publisher=Basic Books|pages=66–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGl_Gu6BwxYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+arabic+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAY0U9_5Iu_JsQT-p4GoBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20arabic%20language&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time frame preceding the construction of the mausoleum, nationalistic feelings in Iran were high.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Struggle for Freedom|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2010|pages=40–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za59PAytkFwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=reza+shah+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pBQ0U9LJHNHmsAST3ILoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reza%20shah%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a renewed sense of national identity partly due to the pressures felt by foreign powers including the constant Anglo-Persian political struggle specially over the issues of oil, and partly due to inability of the [[Qajar]] dynasty from protecting Iranian lands in central Asia to the Russians and in the east to the British. [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC) was an important source of contention for Iranians. One journalist studying during this time period reflects his and his colleagues personal experience:

{{quote|We supported Reza Shah, and we wanted to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism. Ferdowsi became very popular partly because of Reza Shah's support for him, and also partly because of the nationalistic impulses the shahnameh inspired.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;}}

The architecture of Ferdowsi's tomb is also influenced by poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Iranian Narratives: A Thousand Years of Healing|author=Laleh Shahideh|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|pages=125–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHjArCjZ27sC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+Iranian+identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-Qw0U8K4CZDjsATc4oGgBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20Iranian%20identity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in many ways taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.

After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi and even mausoleum of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One of the most dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead embraced by the new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W.

==Interior Design==

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb3.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of Ferdowsi with the accompanying text. To see the translation, see the text on the left.]]
Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires tales of heroic act by [[protagonist]]s fighting against their antagonists. In that sense it is a [[national epic]] that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts of the history of pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is [[Feraydoon Sadeghi]] who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. [[Rostam]], the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus of the majority of the scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the [[tomb stone]] of the poet. Etched in the tomb stone in Farsi (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] content of the tomb is as follows:

&lt;blockquote lang="fa" style="direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;"&gt;بنام خداوند جان و خرد. این مکان فرخنده آرامگاه استاد گویندگان فارسی‌زبان و سراینده داستان‌های ملی ایران، حکیم ابوالقاسم فردوسی طوسی است که سخنان او زنده‌کننده کشور ایران و در دل مردم این سرزمین جاودان است&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[English language|English]] translation is roughly as follows:

{{quote|In the name of the God who created life. This place is the resting place of he (Hakim Abul-qasem Ferdowsi Tusi) who has advanced the art of language among Persian speakers, and the holder of the national epic of Iran and its national stories. His words have given a new life to Iran, and he has a place in the hearts of its people.}}

Today Ferdowsi's tomb is one of the most photographed in Iran.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; Millions of visitors from various [[provinces of Iran]] come to see the tomb every year. Foreign dignitaries, tourists, and other Persian-Speaking civilians from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Middle East]] also visit the site. The most recent was a visit from the Iraqi tourism minister in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.bandarabbas.irna.ir/en/News/80750845/Art_&amp;_Culture/Iraqi_tourism_minister_visits_tomb_of_Ferdowsi|title=Iraqi tourism minister visits tomb of Ferdowsi|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=25 July 2013 |website= IRNA |publisher= IRNA |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has also inspired many Persian poets including [[Iran]]ian poet [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] who is actually physically buried not far from the tomb of Ferdowsi, in his own tomb in the grounds of Ferdowsi's complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">:''Not to be confused with [[Transcendental realism (Schelling)|F. W. J. Schelling's transcendental realism]], [[Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)|Arthur Schopenhauer's transcendental realism]], or [[Transcendental realism (Evola)|Julius Evola's transcendental realism]].''
Initially developed by [[Roy Bhaskar]] in his book ''A Realist Theory of Science'' (1975), '''transcendental realism''' is a [[philosophy of science]] that was initially developed as an argument against [[Epistemological realism|epistemic realism]] of [[positivism]] and [[hermeneutics]]. The position is based on Bhaskar's [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Kant (and modern philosophy)|transcendental]] arguments for certain [[Ontology (philosophy)|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] positions based on what reality must be like in order for scientific knowledge to be possible. 

The overview of transcendental realism that follows is largely based on [[Andrew Sayer]]'s ''Realism and Social Science''.

==Transitive and intransitive domains==
A ''Realist Theory of Science'' starts with a proposed paradox: how it is that people create knowledge as a product of social activities and at the same time knowledge is 'of' things that are not produced by people at all.

The former is inspired by [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhnian]] arguments of how scientific communities develop knowledge and asserts all observation is theory-laden based on previously acquired concepts. As such, it is not a [[Philosophical realism#Na.C3.AFve realism|naïve realist]] perspective that knowledge is a direct acquisition of facts through observation of the real world, but rather that knowledge is fallible. This ontological position is described as the ''transitive domain of knowledge'', in that knowledge can change over time.

The second part of the paradox is asserted to be based on a real world, which exists and behaves in the same manner regardless of whether or not people exist or whether they know about the real world. This is described as the ''intransitive domain of knowledge''. Reducing knowledge to ontology is referred to as the ''epistemic fallacy'', a fallacy that Bhaskar asserts has been made repeatedly over the last 300 years of philosophy of science.

==Real, actual, and empirical==
The exposition of transcendental realism continues that not only is the world divided into a real world and our knowledge of it, but it is further divided into the ''real'', the ''actual'' and the ''empirical''. The ''real'' is the intransitive domain of things that exist (i.e. the real world): objects, their structures and their causal powers. It is important to note that even though these objects and structures may be able to perform certain action, those actions may go unrealized. This gives rise to the ''actual'', which is the events that actually occur, regardless of whether or not people are aware of them. The ''empirical'' contains the events that people have actually experienced. It is important to note that experience may directly refer to the real and/or to the actual.

==Stratification and emergence==
Transcendental realism further argues for a stratified reality. The relationships between objects and the combinations of their causal powers may create entirely new structures with new causal powers. The typical example of this is of water, which has a causal power of extinguishing fire, but is made up of hydrogen and oxygen that have causal powers of combustion.
This stratification spans through all sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, etc. This implies that objects in sociology – labor markets, capitalism, etc. – are just as real as that of physics. This is not a [[Reductionism|reductionist]] position: while each stratum is dependent on the objects and their relationships in the strata below it, the difference in causal powers means that they are necessarily different objects.

==Causality and mechanisms==
Other philosophies of science based on the [[David Hume|Humean]] tradition assert that causality is based on regularity among sequences of events. For transcendental realism, this explanation of causation holds little weight — "what causes something to happen has nothing to do with the number of times we have observed it happening".{{cn|date=August 2018}} Instead of referring to events, transcendental realism refers to causal mechanisms, the internal processes of objects which give rise to events. These mechanisms may lie dormant or may counteract each other and prevent events from occurring.

In the [[biosemiotics|semiotic theories]] of [[Jakob von Uexküll]] and [[Thomas Sebeok|Thomas A. Sebeok]], '''''umwelt''''' (plural: umwelten; from the German ''[[wikt:Umwelt|Umwelt]]'' meaning "environment" or "surroundings") is the "biological foundations that lie at the very epicenter of the study of both [[communication]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] in the human [and non-human] animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas A. |last=Sebeok |title=Contributions to the Doctrine of Signs |location=Lisse, Netherlands |publisher=Peter de Ridder Press |year=1976 |chapter=Foreword |page=x |isbn=0-87750-194-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The following reference seems to be incorrect, the phrase quoted comes up with a reference to Deely 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll, Jakob von]] 1920, 1934/1957; cf.

==Discussion==

Each functional component of an ''umwelt'' has a [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] and so represents the organism's [[model (abstract)|model]] of the world. These functional components correspond approximately to perceptual features,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treisman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Gelade|first2=Garry|title=A feature-integration theory of attention|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1980|volume=12|issue=1|pages=97–136|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described by [[Anne Treisman]]. It is also the [[semiotic]] world of the organism, including all the meaningful aspects of the world for any particular organism, i.e. it can be water, food, shelter, potential threats, or points of reference for navigation. An organism creates and reshapes its own ''umwelt'' when it interacts with the world. This is termed a 'functional circle'. The ''umwelt'' theory states that the mind and the world are inseparable, because it is the mind that interprets the world for the organism. Consequently, the ''umwelten'' of different organisms differ, which follows from the individuality and uniqueness of the history of every single organism. When two ''umwelten'' interact, this creates a [[semiosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thure von |last=Uexküll |year=1987 |chapter=The sign theory of Jakob von Uexküll |editor-last=Krampen |title=Classics of Semiotics |location=New York |publisher=Plenum |pages=147–179 |isbn=0-306-42321-9 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jakob von |last=Uexküll |chapter=A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds |title=Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept |editor-first=Claire H. |editor-last=Schiller |location=New York |publisher=International Universities Press |year=1957 |pages=5– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, ''umwelt'' also unites all the semiotic processes of an organism into a whole. Internally, an organism is the sum of its parts operating in functional circles and, to survive, all the parts must work cooperatively. This is termed the "collective ''umwelt''" which models the organism as a centralised system from the cellular level upward. This requires the [[semiosis]] of any one part to be continuously connected to any other semiosis operating within the same organism. If anything disrupts this process, the organism will not operate efficiently.

Uexküll's writings show a specific interest in the various worlds that he believed to exist ('conceptually') from the point of view of the ''umwelt'' of different creatures such as [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]].

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is, according to [[Agamben]], ''"constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] 'carriers of significance' or 'marks' which are the only things that interest the animal"''. Agamben goes on to paraphrase Uexküll's example of the tick, saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all mammals, (2) The [[temperature]] of 37°C (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairy topography of mammals.

==Critics==
Uexküll's application of the notion of "umwelt" to the human person has been contested. In "Welt und Umwelt" and "Die Wahrheit der Dinge", the philosopher and sociologist [[Josef Pieper]] argued that reason allows the human person to live in "Welt" (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

'''Urban planning''' is a technical and political process concerned with the development and [[design]] of [[land use]] and the built environment, including air, water, and the [[urban infrastructure|infrastructure]] passing into and out of [[urban area]]s, such as [[transportation]], [[communication]]s, and [[distribution network]]s&lt;ref name="WIUP"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is Urban Planning |publisher=School of Urban Planning, [[McGill University]] |url=https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108061506/https://mcgill.ca/urbanplanning/planning |archive-date =8 January 2008 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;and the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors.

It is closely related to the field of [[urban design]] and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning is also referred to as '''urban and regional planning''', '''regional planning''', '''town planning''', '''city planning''', '''rural planning''', '''urban development''' or some combination in various areas worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016. Shifting approaches to planning theory: global north and south. Urban Planning, 1(4), pp.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Urban planning guides orderly development in urban, [[suburb]]an and [[rural area]]s. Although predominantly concerned with the planning of [[Human settlement|settlements]] and communities, urban planning is also responsible for the planning and development of [[water use]] and resources, rural and agricultural land, parks and conserving areas of natural environmental significance. [[Urban planner|Practitioners of urban planning]] are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[architecture]], urban design, [[public consultation]], policy recommendations, implementation and management.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Enforcement methodologies include governmental [[zoning]], [[planning permission]]s, and [[building code]]s,&lt;ref name="WIUP" /&gt; as well as private [[easements]] and [[restrictive covenant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Smit |first1=Anneke |last2=Valiante |first2=Marcia |year=2015 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Smit |editor1-first=Anneke |editor2-last=Valiante |editor2-first=Marcia |title=Public Interest, Private Property: Law and Planning Policy in Canada |location=Vancouver, British Columbia |publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]] |pages=1–36, page 10 |isbn=978-0-7748-2931-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture, [[landscape architecture]], [[civil engineering]], and [[public administration]] to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals. Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields. Today urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline. The discipline is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as [[land-use planning]], [[zoning]], [[economic development]], [[environmental planning]], and [[transportation planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Planning? |publisher=American Planning Association |url=https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310195220/https://www.planning.org/aboutplanning/whatisplanning.htm |archive-date=10 March 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of urban planning|}}

There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations in the [[3rd millennium BC|third millennium BCE]].  Archeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern.&lt;ref name=Davreu1&gt;Davreu, Robert (1978). "Cities of Mystery: The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley". ''The World’s Last Mysteries''. (second edition). Sydney: Readers’ Digest. pp. 121-129. {{ISBN|0-909486-61-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it.  Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid-like) plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, Frank (1984). Die Stadt im Altertum. München: Verlag C.H. Beck. pp. 51-141: Morris, A.E.J. (1972). History of Urban Form. Prehistory to the Renaissance. London. pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities.  City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience.  The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning.  As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared.  However, many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center.  Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries, often grew organically and sometimes chaotically. But in the following centuries some newly created towns were built according to preconceived plans, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dare.uva.nl/en/record/336940|title=The foundation, planning and building of new towns in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. An architectural-historical research into urban form and its creation.|last=Boerefijn|first=Wim|publisher=Phd. thesis Universiteit van Amsterdam|year=2010|isbn=978-90-9025157-8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century on, much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved. In this period, theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted. During the Enlightenment period, several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities.  During the [[Second French Republic]], [[Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], under the direction of [[Napoleon III]], redesigned the city of [[Paris]] into a more modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=David|title=Baron Haussmann and Modern Paris|journal=American Scholar|date=1992|volume=61|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate. The pace and style of this industrial construction was largely dictated by the concerns of private business. The evils of urban life for the [[working poor]] were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The [[laissez-faire]] style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]] that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]], by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.

At the beginning of the 20th century, urban planning began to be recognized as a profession. The [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded in 1899 and the first academic course in Great Britain on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. {{Britannica|619445|Urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the ideas of [[modernism]] and uniformity began to surface in urban planning, and lasted until the 1970s.  Many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems.&lt;ref name="Midgley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris-1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris |first=Eleanor Smith |display-authors=etal |year=1997 |title=British Town Planning and Urban Design: Principles and policies |location=[[Harlow]], Essex, Enngland |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=147–149 |isbn=978-0-582-23496-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planners now focus more on individualism and diversity in urban centers.

==Theories==
{{Further|Theories of urban planning|}}
Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning&lt;ref&gt;Watson, V., 2016. Shifting approaches to planning theory: global north and south. Urban Planning, 1(4), pp.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Whittmore |first=Andrew |date=2 February 2015 |title=How Planners Use Planning Theory |publisher=Planetizen | url = http://www.planetizen.com/node/73570/how-planners-use-planning-theory | accessdate =24 April 2015}} ''citing'' {{Cite journal|last=Whittemore |first=Andrew H. |year=2014 |title=Practitioners Theorize, Too Reaffirming Planning Theory in a Survey of Practitioners’ Theories |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=76–85 |doi=10.1177/0739456X14563144}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects==
{{Further|Technical aspects of urban planning|}}

Technical aspects of urban planning involve the applying scientific, technical processes, considerations and features that are involved in planning for [[land use]], [[urban design]], [[natural resource|natural resources]], [[transport|transportation]], and [[infrastructure]]. Urban planning includes techniques such as: predicting [[population growth]], [[zoning]], geographic mapping and analysis, analyzing park space, surveying the [[water supply]], identifying transportation patterns, recognizing food supply demands, allocating healthcare and social services, and analyzing the impact of land use.

In order to predict how cities will develop and estimate the effects of their interventions, planners use various models. These models can be used to indicate relationships and patterns in demographic, geographic, and economic data. They might deal with short-term issues such as how people move through cities, or long-term issues such as land use and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=John D. |last=Landis |year=2012 |chapter=Modeling Urban Systems| editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=323–350 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Building code]]s and other regulations dovetail with urban planning by governing how cities are constructed and used from the individual level.&lt;ref&gt;''Codes, rules, and standards are part of a matrix of relations that influence the practice of urban planning and design. These forms of regulation provide an important and inescapable framework for development, from the laying out of subdivisions to the control of stormwater runoff. The subject of regulations leads to the source of how communities are designed and constructed—defining how they can and can't be built—and how codes, rules, and standards continue to shape the physical space where we live and work.'' {{Cite book|last=Ben-Joseph |first=Eran |year=2012 |chapter=Codes and Standards in Urban Planning and Design | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=352–370 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban planners==
{{Further|Urban planner|}}
An urban planner is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a community's land use and infrastructure. They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas, typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic, environmental and social trends. In developing any plan for a community (whether commercial, residential, agricultural, natural or recreational), urban planners must consider a wide array of issues including [[urban sustainability|sustainability]], existing and potential [[pollution]], [[transport]] including potential [[traffic congestion|congestion]], [[crime]], land values, economic development, social equity, [[zoning]] codes, and other legislation.

The importance of the urban planner is increasing in the 21st century, as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth, climate change and unsustainable development. An urban planner could be considered a [[Green-collar worker|green collar]] professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kamenetz |first1=Anya |title=Ten Best Green Jobs for the Next Decade |website=fastcompany |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826065655/https://www.fastcompany.com/1129671/ten-best-green-jobs-next-decade |dead-url=yes |archivedate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that urban planners around the world work in different "[[planning cultures]]", adapted to their local cities and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Friedman |first=John |year=2012 |chapter=Varieties of Planning Experience: Toward a Globalized Planning Culture? | editor1-last=Weber |editor1-first=Rachel |editor2-last=Crane |editor2-first=Randall |title=The Oxford Handbook of Urban Planning |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=87–98 |isbn=978-0-19-537499-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professionals have identified skills, abilities and basic knowledge sets that are common to urban planners across national and regional boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Institutes of Certified Planners Certification|url=https://www.planning.org/aicp/|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional standards|url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/membership/professional-standards/|website=Royal Institute of Town Planners|publisher=Royal Town Planning Institute|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISOCARP|url=https://isocarp.org/about-isocarp/|publisher=International Society of City and Regional Planners|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VinylPlus''' was founded by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), the European Stabiliser Producers Association (ESPA), European Plasticisers and the European Plastics Converters (EuPC) in 2011 when the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] industry renewed a previous initiative called Vinyl 2010. VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the [[United Nations|UN]]’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and the [[circular economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=91|title=VinylPlus - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

VinylPlus is included in the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)]] and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria. 

== History ==
VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry’s first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of [[Responsible Care]] adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives.

At the same time, the [[European Union]] also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive]] (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules.

Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme’s activities, and includes representatives from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], trade unions, consumer associations, academia and members of the European 

== Progress Report ==
VinylPlus publishes an annual Progress Report summarising progress and data. Progress is measured against each of the five sustainability challenges identified for PVC. All information included in the report is presented to the Monitoring Committee and independently audited by third parties.

== Product Label ==
The VinylPlus Product Label was launched in 2018 as an identification tool.

== Recycling ==
One aspect of the programme is to Improve recycling figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vinylplus.eu/recycling/circular-economy|title=VinylPlus - The Circular Economy|website=vinylplus.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum ==
VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs.  The themes from past forums have been:

* 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond
* 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships
* 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon
* 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities
* 2017: Towards Circular Economy
* 2018: Meeting Societal Needs

== Governance ==
VinylPlus’s management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee’s stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus’s transparency, participation and accountability. 

== Affiliates ==
==== Recovinyl ====
The Recovinyl  programme was set up in 2003 as part of Vinyl 2010’s commitment. Its original mission was to advance waste collection and recycling schemes. When the Vinyl 2010 programme ended, it was given a dual role under the new VinylPlus initiative. While Recovinyl still encourages PVC recycling, it also aims to optimise resource efficiency by acting as an intermediary between recyclers and converters.

==== Vinyl Foundation ==== 
The Vinyl Foundation is the non-profit organisation that manages the funds from the European PVC product manufacturers, compounders and raw material traders that support VinylPlus.

'''Virtual heritage''' or '''cultural heritage and technology''' is the body of works dealing with information and communication technologies ([[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]]) and their application to [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''virtual [[archaeology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Bawaya|first = M.| title = Virtual Archaeologists Recreate Parts of Ancient Worlds | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 140–141 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1126/science.327.5962.140 | pmid=20056870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual heritage and cultural heritage have independent meanings: ''cultural heritage'' refers to sites, monuments, buildings and objects "with historical, aesthetic, archaeological, scientific, ethnological or anthropological value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/408 | title  = Application Guide  | author = [[UNESCO]] | year = 2008 | work = Applications to UNESCO-Vocations Patrimoine Fellowships for World Heritage site managers | publisher = [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]] | accessdate = 4 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''virtual heritage'' refers to instances of these within a technological domain, usually involving [[Visualization (computer graphics)|computer visualization]] of artefacts or [[Virtual Reality]] environments.

One technology that is frequently employed in virtual heritage applications is [[augmented reality]], which is used to provide on-site reconstructions of archaeological sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archeoguide.intranet.gr/ | title  = ARCHEOGUIDE - Augmented Reality-based Cultural Heritage On-site Guide | year = 2002 | work = ARCHEOGUIDE Project | accessdate = 23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or artefacts.

Many virtual heritage projects focus on the tangible aspects of cultural heritage, for example [[3D modelling]], [[Computer graphics|graphics]] and [[Computer animation|animation]]. In doing so they often overlook the intangible aspects of cultural heritage associated with objects and sites, such as stories, performances and dances. The tangible aspects of cultural heritage are not inseparable from the intangible and one method for combining them is the use of virtual heritage [[serious game]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Anderson|first1 = E.

==First use==
The first use of virtual heritage as a museum exhibit, and the derivation of the name [[virtual tour]], was in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csanet.org/newsletter/feb95/nl029504.html | title  = Imaging The Past  | author = Susan S. Lukesh | date = Feb 1995 | work = CSA Newsletter, Feb. '95 | publisher = Center for the Study of Architecture | accessdate = 3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a museum visitor interpretation, providing a 'walk-through' of a [[3D reconstruction]] of [[Dudley Castle]] in [[England]] as it was in 1550.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Boland|first1 = P.|last2 = Johnson|first2 = C.|editor1-last = Higgins|editor1-first = T.|editor2-last = Main|editor2-first = P.|editor3-last = Lang|editor3-first = J.|contribution = Archaeology as computer visualization: 'Virtual tours' of Dudley Castle c. 1550|title = Imaging the Past: Electronic Imaging and Computer Graphics in Museums and Archaeology| series = Occasional Papers |volume = 114 |publisher = 
[[British Museum#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |pages= 227–234 |year=1996 | isbn = 0-86159-114-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc based system designed by British-based engineer Colin Johnson. It is a little-known fact that one of the first users of Virtual Heritage was [[Queen Elizabeth II]], when she officially opened the visitor centre in June 1994.
Because the Queen's officials had requested titles, descriptions and instructions of all activities, the system was named 'Virtual Tour', being a cross between [[virtual reality]] and Royal Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exrenda.com/dudley/index.htm|title=Virtual Tours of Dudley Castle archive|author=Colin Johnson|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Robert ('Bill') Freudenburg''', (2 November 1951 &amp;ndash; 28 December 2010) was an environmental [[sociologist]] and [[social theorist]], best known for his work in [[rural sociology]] on the topics of [[risk perception]], [[social disruption]], and the causes of [[environmental degradation]]. Born in [[Madison, Nebraska]], raised in [[West Point, Nebraska]], he was educated at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] and [[Yale University]]. Freudenburg was a professor of sociology at a number of universities; his ultimate position was as Dehlsen Professor of [[Environmental Studies]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg.php Faculty web page]. Accessed 2009-12-08. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022120046/http://www.es.ucsb.edu/faculty/freudenburg.php |date=22 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], of [[cholangiocarcinoma]] (cancer of the [[bile duct]]).&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Much of Freudenburg's research dealt with the relationship between society and the environment, often in rural communities. Although not opposed to forms of [[environmentalism]] which emphasize  reducing one’s impact on the environment (such as [[recycling]]), Freudenburg focused less on the role of consumers and more on the role of [[environmental regulation|regulatory structure]] and actions of industry, emphasizing the socially structured sources of [[environmental impact]]s. He was prominent in both [[Rural sociology|rural]] and [[environmental sociology]], and was elected and served as president of the [[Rural Sociological Society]] in 2004-2005, and at the time of his death was president-elect of the [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS), an organization which he helped found.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Education and career==
Freudenburg completed his undergraduate work at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] and then earned three graduate degrees, including his Ph.D., from [[Yale University]]. He began his professional career at [[Washington State University]], then moved to the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he spent most of his professional career. During that time, a compilation by graduate students found Freudenburg to have published more articles on environment-society relationships in leading journals than anyone else.  While he was still on the faculty at Wisconsin, he was nominated for an endowed professorship at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], which he accepted, and he worked at UCSB until his death.

==Theory of double diversion==
Freudenburg published a number influential ideas, but his central focus in recent years was on what he called the [[double diversion]].  Although in his latter years he taught in the program established in part by [[Garrett Hardin]], and he often stressed his high regard for Hardin's work, the predictions that derive from Freudenburg's double diversion work are contrary to those associated with Hardin's "tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, Garrett, "The Tragedy of the Commons."  Science 162 (13 December 1968): 1243-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than being due mainly to the actions of individual consumers, Freudenburg argued, much or most of all environmental harm is actually due to a small number of organized producers. Contrary to the notion that environmental protection is bad for the economy and jobs, the worst sources of environmental harm are commonly due to a surprisingly small fraction of all economic activity—and to an even smaller fraction of the jobs. In the first peer-reviewed article in which this perspective was spelled out, for example, Freudenburg found that the majority of all toxic emissions in the U.S. economy came from industries that were responsible for only about 5% of the gross national product—and just 1.4% of the nation's jobs.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Freudenburg, "Privileged Access, Privileged Accounts:  Toward a Socially Structured Theory of Resources and Discourses." Social Forces 84.1 (2005) 89-114 http://repositories.cdlib.org/postprints/1445&lt;/ref&gt;

*Freudenburg, William R. and Gramling, Robert. ''Oil in Troubled Waters: Perceptions, Politics, and the Battle over Offshore Drilling''. Albany: SUNY Press, 1994.

===''Catastrophe in the Making''===
"Catastrophe" was written with Robert Gramling, Shirley B. Laska, and [[Kai T. Erikson]]. It was published in August 2009, on the fourth anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]:  ''Catastrophe in the Making: The Engineering of Katrina and the Disasters of Tomorrow''. (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2009). Unlike most "Katrina" books, which tend to focus on the hurricane's aftermath, this one discusses the ways in which [[public works]] projects—supposedly designed to bring greater prosperity to [[New Orleans]]—actually had little if any economic benefits, while potentially contributing to the storm's devastation.  Particularly noteworthy in this connection was the [[Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Canal]] (MRGO), which did little to serve as an "outlet" for commerce, but did serve as a major inlet for salt water, which killed much of the vegetation that held together the fragile but formerly healthy wetlands to the southeast of New Orleans. Providing the reader with New Orleans history, engineering data, and scholarly analysis, the authors argue that land development in the region led to the creation of several canals intended to promote economic prosperity, which ironically resulted in the intended economic capital was never realized due to the excessive maintenance costs. Instead, significant human capital was lost in 2005 as the canals and their subsequent environmental degradation exacerbated the impact of Katrina and her deadly floodwaters.

===''Blowout in the Gulf''===
Freudenburg's final published book, written with long-time collaborator Robert Gramling, was released in October 2010. ''Blowout in the Gulf: The BP Oil Spill Disaster and the Future of Energy in America'' (Cambridge MIT Press) puts the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]] in historical and policy perspective.

===''Robbing Nature's Bank''===
Before he died, Freudenburg was working on a book tentatively entitled ''Robbing Nature’s Bank'', which explored learning from problems of the past in order to prevent similar “unnatural disasters” in the future. The manuscript focuses less on the individual factors in harming the environment and points out that a large majority of this harm comes from organizational factors.
