      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16892">In [[psychology]], an '''affectional bond''' is a type of attachment behavior one individual has for another individual,&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowlby, J. |title=The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds |publisher=Routledge Classics |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically a caregiver for her or his child,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/pendry.html&lt;/ref&gt; in which the two partners tend to remain in proximity to one another.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 2005"/&gt; The term was coined and subsequently developed over the course of four decades, from the early 1940s to the late 1970s, by psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in his work on [[attachment theory]]. The core of the term ''affectional bond'', according to Bowlby, is the attraction one individual has for another individual. The central features of the concept of affectional bonding can be traced to Bowlby's 1958 paper, "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother".&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 39: 350–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five criteria==
Bowlby referred to attachment bonds as a specific type of "affectional" bond, as described by him and developmental psychologist [[Mary Ainsworth]]. She established five criteria for affectional bonds between individuals, and a sixth criterion for attachment bonds:
* An affectional bond is persistent, not transitory.
* An affectional bond involves a particular person who is not interchangeable with anyone else.
* An affectional bond involves a relationship that is emotionally significant.
* The individual wishes to maintain proximity or contact with the person with whom he or she has an affectional tie.
* The individual feels sadness or distress at involuntary separation from the person.

An attachment bond has an additional criterion: the person seeks security and comfort in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S. (1989). Attachments beyond infancy. ''American Psychologist'', 44, 709716. Reference for the entire section "Five criteria"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachment theory==

===Background===

Bowlby believed that there were four distinguishing characteristics of attachment. These included:

*Proximity Maintenance: The desire to be near the people we are attached to.
*Safe Haven: Returning to the attachment figure for comfort and safety in the face of fear or threat.
*Secure Base: The attachment figure acts as a base of security from which the child can explore the surrounding environment.
*Separation Distress: Anxiety that occurs in the absence of the attachment figure.

Bowlby's thoughts on distinguishing attachment led the way for many other psychologists' viewpoints on attachment and the various bonds that attachment coincides with.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby, J."&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A Secure Base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment through the lifespan==

===Attachment style===
Child psychologist Mary Ainsworth further expanded on Bowlby's research by conducting an experiment that is known as the "Strange Situation" experiment. In the experiment, a parent and child are alone in the room. A stranger then walks into the room and talks to the parent. After some amount of time, the parent quietly exits the room, leaving the stranger and child in the room. The child then reacts to the situation at hand and then the parent re-enters the room and comforts the child. From this groundbreaking study, Ainsworth developed different forms of attachment styles that infants display with the people they are close to.&lt;ref name = "Ainsworth"&gt;Ainsworth, M.; Blehar, M.; Waters, E.; and Wall, S. (1978). Patterns of Attachment. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secure attachment====
[[Secure attachment]] in infancy was characterized by noticeable distress when the parent left the room. When the parent returned, the child was extremely happy to see them. Infants are more likely to choose a parent over any other person, especially a stranger. As they embark on childhood, those who maintain secure attachment have an easier time making friends and meeting new people and hold a trustworthy bond with their parents.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; Adolescents benefit from parental support, but they are also beginning to make the transitions from relying heavily on their parents to a more independent environment with more freedom.&lt;ref name = "Doyle, Moretti, Voss &amp; Margolese"&gt;Doyle, A. B., Moretti, M. M., Voss, K., &amp; Margolese, S. (2006, February). Attachment to parents and adjustment in adolescents: Literature review and policy implications. Retrieved from http://www.cyc-net.org/cyc-online/cycol-0206-attachment.html&lt;/ref&gt; In adulthood, they are more likely to have long-lasting relationships, high self-esteem, find pleasure from romantic relationships and are able to easily talk with their partners.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

====Ambivalent-insecure attachment====
'''Ambivalent attachment''' is characterized by a strong wariness towards strangers. Children get extremely uncomfortable when they do not have a noticeable face in the room. When the parent returns, the child receives no comfort from their return and is inconsolable.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt; In childhood, these children tend to act "clingy" towards their parents and tend to heavily rely on others. In adulthood, they have difficulty with trust and feel that their partner does not exhibit the same feelings towards them. Insecurely attached adults tend to act cold and experience many break-ups throughout their life.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Avoidant-insecure attachment====
Infants and children with '''avoidant attachment''' tend to show no preference between their caregivers and the stranger. They do not actively seek much comfort of contact from their parents and usually tend to avoid them. In adulthood, those with avoidant attachment have difficulty maintaining relationships due to the inability to display emotions. They are more likely to engage in casual sex and think about other people or things while they are having sex. Finally, they are not likely to be supportive when other people are in stressful situations and have an inability to look at ideas in another person's perspective.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth"/&gt;

====Disorganized-insecure attachment====

'''Disorganized Attachment''' in infants tends to display avoidant and unsure behavior. They tend to be in a daze and seem confused about the situation that they are in. They tend not show any clear signs of attachment at any point in their lives.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth" /&gt;

This fourth form of attachment was observed in later studies conducted by Main and Solomon.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Solomon"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of an insecure-disorganized/ disoriented attachment pattern: Procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior. In T. B. Brazelton &amp; M. Yogman (Eds.), Affective Development in Infancy, 95-124. Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have supported Ainsworth's observations. These studies have also shown that attachment styles developed in infancy can influence behavior later in life. Children in this group tend to take on a parental role and act like a caregiver toward their parent. They display an overall inconsistent form of behavior. Research by Main and Hesse showed that parents who use tactics of fear and assurance contribute to this disorganized form of attachment.&lt;ref name = "Main &amp; Hesse"&gt;Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E. (1990). Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status: Is frightened/frightening parental behavior the linking mechanism? In M. T. Greenberg, D. Cicchetti, &amp; E. M. Cummings (Eds.), Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention, 161-182. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal corrected partnership===

According to Bowlby's ideas of attachment, '''goal-corrected partnership''' is the last stage that a child experiences. It usually happens around age three. As the child begins spending more time with their caregiver, they begin to realize that their caregiver has goals and ideas of their own that may not concern the child.&lt;ref name = "Benson"&gt;Benson, J. B. (2009). Social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood. (1 ed., Vol. 1, p. 34). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VUvdHreepDYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq Social and Emotional Development in Infancy and Early Childhood&amp;ots=Ox_xcFAxi9&amp;sig=UZW8V21UjzOOCsExAThrRCY_CHk&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the child begins to "mold their behavior in order to please or impress the caregiver". This type of bond is most likely to occur between the infant and the mother.

==Caregivers==

[[Caregivers]] play an important role in children's lives for several reasons. It is important for the child to have an affectional bond with the person who is caring for that child. According to Bowlby, caregivers can be anyone who is caring for the child but is usually the mother or father of that child. Children place a high value on their relationship with their parents and will alter their behavior to meet the desired behavior from their parents. Bowlby explains by the time the child has reached twelve months of age the child has developed a strong relationship with his mother.  Freud who is cited in Bowlby's article "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother" says that a child's first love is a satisfaction of the need for food and an object for food, so either the mother's breast or bottle of milk.&lt;ref name = "Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1958). "The Nature of the Childs Tie to his Mother." International Journal of Psychoanalysis 39: 350–373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby has four theories that explain how the attachment and bond are created between a child and his or her caregiver.

*Secondary drive: When the physiological needs of the child are met, for example when the child needs are met by the mother feeding or keeping her child warm.
*Primary object sucking: Infants have an innate quality that needs to be filled by sucking on the mother's breast which he realized is connected to his mother, therefore creating a stronger bond.
*Primary object clinging: Besides food as a primary need, the feel or touch of another human is also a primary need for infants so they cling to their parents to meet this need.
*Primary return-to-womb craving: Infants crave to go back inside their mother's womb.

==Other affectional bonds through the lifespan==

===Mother to infant===
The bond between mothers and infants has been determined to be the core bond during the lifespan for mothers and children.  At birth, mothers go through a postpartum period where they feel detached from their infant and need to create a new bond different from the one that was created during the prenatal period.  The bond between mother and infant is just as important to the mother as it is to the infant.  This bond can be formed after the once believed critical period of postpartum skin contact.  This first emotional bond is the basis of all future relationships and bonds in the child's future.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=0BBIVLW5HKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=affectional+bond&amp;ots=XVKDgT4Lxb&amp;sig=WAuJ7vWXdX_qQ7h2FmQA2WPpItc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father to child===
The bond between father and child has been found to be more important than previously believed, however it has not been found to be as important as the bond between mother and child.  Children do bond with fathers as a caregiver but the level of the strength of the bond is dependent upon the level of involvement by the father.  However, there is not sufficient research on the subject to draw any other conclusions on the bond and on father's involvement.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===Sexual partnership===
The bond between sexual partners is characterized with three components which are reproductive, attachment and caregiver, and they may be more prevalent in certain relationships than in others.  In some sexual partnerships there is only a reproductive component, with no emotional attachment.  When an attachment is formed on top of the reproductive bond, the male is likely to take on a caregiver role with offspring as well as his mate; which in western culture is usually his wife.  In western culture the pair often exchanges levels of care, and attachment throughout the lifespan.  In traditional married couples the level of sexual attachment changes throughout the lifespan of the relationship thus stating that there are other important aspects of the bond between man and wife.  Couples share an emotional and intellectual bond on top of the sexual one.  In western society traditional gender roles are being challenged which is impacting the level of male caregiver attachment to his wife; however there is not a large field of research on the subject.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

Homosexual couples are hypothesized to share much of the same attachment components; however there is little research on the subject to draw conclusions from.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

===Friends, companions, intimates===
The bond formed between friends, companions and intimates are essential bonds to the lifetime.  These bonds are essential for social development because they differ from the bonds formed with parents and other kin.  Humans are naturally social creatures thus forming bonds with other people comes naturally.  These relationships are often formed through common interests, and proximity.  Friendships begin in early childhood, and last throughout adulthood.  Many different friendships are formed throughout the lifespan and they can be any length of time.  Again, these bonds tend to not be as strong as those formed with other kin, but the social aspects of them are essential to development.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com" /&gt;

===Siblings and other kin===
The bond between siblings and other kin is largely dependent upon the age of the kin, and the level of involvement with the child.  Older siblings can take on more of a parental role with younger siblings thus creating more of a parental bond.  This parental bond is found when a parent dies, or when the level of parental involvement is low, however this area of research is still fairly new.  Siblings that are close in age often have more of a friendship bond.  Siblings can also have a different type of bond that is not seen in other relationships because siblings have a close bond but may have more indecisive feelings towards each other.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

The bond between other kin is largely dependent on the society that the child grows up in.  In more collectivist cultures the bond between kin is stronger than in the individualistic ones.  The level of bond between kin is often because of shared values, culture, background, and personal experiences.  There is little research on this subject thus the level of information is still low.&lt;ref name = "books.google.com"/&gt;

==Harlow's attachment in non-human animals==
Attachment is not something that is only limited to humans, it is seen in non-human animals as well. A classic study demonstrating attachment in animals was done by Harry Harlow with his macaque monkeys. His study suggests that an infant not only feels attachment to his/her mother because of needs for nutrients and protection, but they feel attachment to their mother for needs of comfort as well.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"&gt;Harlow, H. F. (1958). The nature of love. American Psychologist, 13, 673-685.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Harry Harlow's experiment he separated infant monkeys from their mothers 6–12 hours after birth and raised them in a laboratory, isolated from humans and other monkeys. In each cage these infant monkeys had two "mothers." One mother was made solely from wire, and the other mother was made from a block of wood and sponge rubber which was then wrapped with terry cloth; both radiated heat. In one condition only the wire mother nursed, and in the other condition only the terry cloth mother nursed.&lt;ref name = "Harlow"/&gt;

The results show that infant monkeys spent significantly more time with the terry cloth mother whether she provided nutrients or not.&lt;ref name="Harlow"/&gt; This demonstrates that infants not only need their mothers to provide food and protection, but they need to provide some sort of comfort as well.

{{Orphan|date=October 2017}}

'''''L'Angelo Nocchiero''''' ('''''The Angel-Helmsman''''') is a marble sculpture in the '[[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]' style by the Genovese sculptor [[:it:Giovanni Scanzi|Giovanni Scanzi]] (1840-1915), completed in 1886. It was commissioned by [[Commons:Category:Tomba Giacomo Carpaneto (Cimitero di Staglieno)|Giacomo Carpaneto]], Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) as a monument for his family tomb in the [[:it:Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno|Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno]] ([[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]), in [[Genoa|Genova, Italy]].
Along with the sculpture for the [[Monteverde Angel|Oneto Family]] sculpted by Giulio Monteverde in 1882,&lt;ref&gt;Berenco Gardin, Gianni, and Nesso Parlato, Gabriella (1993). 
''Il Giardino del Tempo''. [Roma:] Peliti Associati, dust-jacket cover and pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; the Carpaneto monument has become one of the most recognisable icons of Staglieno,
appearing on an official cemetery brochure in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Staglieno Cimitero Monumentale (2014). "Settimana dei Cimiteri Storici Europei", 23 maggio-1 giugno 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 11 vintage.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), Giovanni Scanzi, sculptor (early photograph, ca.1895)]]

==The artist, his patron, and his model==

Giovanni Scanzi was 38 years old when his patron Cav. Giacomo Carpaneto died and he began
work on the Carpaneto family tomb at Staglieno. Scanzi's early work was in the Realist style,
&lt;ref name=Sborgi&gt;Sborgi, Franco (1997). ''Staglieno e la Scultura Funeraria Ligure tra Ottocento e Novecento''.
Torino: Artema, p.147, ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
and by this time he had also incorporated Symbolism
(or, perhaps more accurately, "l'iperdecorativismo eclettico"&lt;ref name=Sborgi /&gt;),
as seen in his sculptures of the
''Angelo della Resurrezione'' (Angel of Resurrection) on the  [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Carlo_di_G.B._Casella_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|Carlo di G.B. Casella family tomb]] (1877);
the later relief for the [[Commons:Category:Tomba_Elisa_Falcone_(Cimitero_di_Staglieno)|tomb of Elisa Falcone]] (1893); and other works at Staglieno.

Giacomo Carpaneto, Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) was a respected merchant,
part of a family originally from
Sampierdarena (S. Petri ad Arenaria) where the Palazzo Centurione-Carpaneto still
stands.&lt;ref name=Marchetti&gt;Marchetti, Rita Nello (2014). ''Caterina e l'Angelo: Il volto popolare e l'anima nobile del Cimitero di Staglieno''. Genova: Erga edizioni, pp.74-76,91-93&lt;/ref&gt;
Signora Carpaneto also is interred in the family tomb.

The model for the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' sculpture was Antonio Dellapiane (1868-1942).
After school, he worked as a shop-boy in a joiner's workshop in Sampierdarena, where Scanzi met him. Later, he started his own workshop, becoming a successful carpenter and wood carver.
&lt;ref name=Marchetti /&gt;

==Symbolism==
The sculpture depicts an angel, standing astride a small boat, beginning to secure the sails at the end of a journey. His garments are streaming behind him, suggesting a strong wind. The prow of the boat is the stoic face of a woman, and under the prow the water swirls. Ropes are coiled in minute detail inside the boat (even though the average cemetery visitor would not be able to see them), and at the back of the boat is an embroidered cushion, slightly dented from a head resting there until a moment earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/langelo-nocchiero-e-il-mare-della-vita/ |title=L'Angelo Nocchiero e il mare della vita |author=Miss Fletcher |date=16 January 2017}} dearmissfletcher.wordpress.com/, retrieved 25 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat would be a familiar symbol to anyone in 19th century Genova, a seaport town,
and the ''Angelo Nocchiero'' - ''Angel Helmsman'' - reminds the viewer of the spiritual
boatmen of ancient mythology, whose job it was to transport the departed into the afterlife.
The clear imagery of the Guiding Angel is underscored by the epigraph in bronze lettering
on the pedestal: "AVVENTURATO CHI NEL MARE DELLA VITA EBBE NOCCHIERO SÌ FIDO" - "Blessed
is he who on the sea of life had so sure a guide".&lt;ref&gt;(anonymous)(n.d.).

==History==
Many famous people of the 19th century visited Staglieno, including Friedrich Nietzsche,
Guy de Maupassant, and Mark Twain, who wrote about it in glowing terms in his ''Innocents Abroad'' (1868).
&lt;ref&gt;Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE). [http://www.significantcemeteries.org/2012/01/staglieno-cemetery-genova-italy.html "Staglieno Cemetery (Genoa, Italy)"] www.significantcemeteries.org/, retrieved 5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The visit in March 1893 of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, fondly known as 'Sissi', is legendary. Periodicals of the time reported that she arrived incognito as 'Lady Parker', and walked from the Principe to Staglieno, visiting a number of significant places along the way. When she came before Scanzi's ''Nocchiero'', she paused,&lt;ref&gt;Resasco, Ferdinando (1904). ''Staglieno Camposanto''. Milano: Menotti Bassanti &amp; C., pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt; apparently moved, and after a period of contemplation, had the epigraph copied into her personal notebook.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Secolo XIX''
(12 March 1893) "L'Imperatrice visita
Genova: da Principe a Staglieno a piedi"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==

[[File:Angelo nocchiero staglieno 00 during restoration angel with foam 1.jpg|thumb|''Angelo Nocchiero'' (1886), during the 2016 restoration process]]

Mark Twain &lt;ref&gt;Twain, Mark [Samuel Langhorne Clemens](1869). ''The Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims' Progress''. Hartford, Connecticut: American Publishing Company, p.170&lt;/ref&gt; described the monuments at Staglieno as "exquisitely wrought . . . full of grace and beauty. They are new, and snowy; every outline is perfect." After a century and a half Twain's description would not be quite the same, as the dust, mildew and pollution of an industrial city have settled on the marble surfaces, thieves have removed valuable bronze and other materials, and vandals have broken or otherwise defaced some of the monuments. &lt;ref&gt;American Friends of Italian Monumental Sculpture [A.F.I.M.S.] (2017), "Carpaneto Memorial, 1886", https://staglieno.com/carpaneto-memorial-1886/, retrieved 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bible-related}}

'''Biblical literalist chronology''' is the attempt to correlate the theological dates used in the Bible with the real chronology of actual events.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The Bible measures time from the date of [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] (years are measured as [[anno mundi]], or AM, meaning Year of the World), but there is no agreement on when this was, some of the better-known alternatives including Archbishop [[Ussher chronology|James Ussher]], who placed it in 4004 BCE, [[Isaac Newton]] in 4000 BCE, [[Martin Luther]] in 3961 BCE, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the [[Septuagint]], of 5009 BCE.{{sfn|Day|2014|p=3-4}} To the foundation of the Temple of Solomon the passage of time is measured by simple addition of from the Creation; for later periods it measures time by the reigns of kings, but the data is conflicting and there is no agreement on how to resolve the problems.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}}{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}} 

== Background ==
The Jewish Bible (the Christian [[Old Testament]]) dates events either by simple arithmetic taking the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]] as the starting point, or, in the later books, by correlations between the reigns of kings in Israel and Judah.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96}} The data it provides falls into three periods:{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=96-97}}
# From the Creation to Abraham's migration to Canaan, during which events are dated by adding the ages of the patriarchs;
# From Abraham's migration to the foundation of Solomon's temple, in which the chronology in Genesis continues to be arrived at by adding ages, but from Exodus on is usually given in statements;
# From the foundation of the temple onward, which gives the reigns in years (sometimes shorter periods) of kings in Israel and Judah.
 
For the biblical authors the chronology was theological in intent, functioning as prophecy and not as history.{{sfn|Christensen|1990|p=148}}{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=73-74}} [[Biblical literalism]], however, does not treat it this way, because literalists have a profound respect for the Bible as the word of God.{{sfn|Olson|2011|p=22}} This way of thinking had its origins in [[Christian fundamentalism]], an early 20th century movement which opposed then-current non-supernatural interpretations of the life of Jesus by stressing, among other things, the verbal inspiration of scripture.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}} The underlying concept, or fear, was that if everything in the Bible were not true, everything would collapse.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=28}}

==Literalist chronologies==
The creation of a literalist chronology of the Bible faces several hurdles, of which the following are the most significant:
* There are different texts of the Jewish Bible, the major text-families being: the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the original Hebrew scriptures made in the last few centuries before Christ; the [[Masoretic text]], a version of the Hebrew text curated by the Jewish rabbis but the earliest manuscripts of which date from the early years of the 2nd millennium CE; and the Samaritan text, restricted to the five books of the Torah plus the Book of Joshua. The three differ quite markedly from each other.{{sfn|Northcote|2004|p=1}}
* Literalists prefer the Masoretic text, on which Protestant Bibles are based, but the Masoretic text sometimes contains absurdities, as when it states that Saul came to the throne at the age of one and reigned for two years. Such obvious errors can be corrected by reference to other versions of the Bible (in this case the Septuagint, which gives more realistic numbers), but their existence calls into question the fundamentalist idea that the MT text is the inspired word of God.{{sfn|Vriezen|van der Woude|2005|p=98}} Most fundamentalists, with the notable exception of the [[King James Only]] movement, avoid this by holding that only the authors of the original autographs (the very first copies written by [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]] and others) were inspired by God.{{sfn|Whelan|2012|p=unpaginated}}
* The Bible is not always consistent.{{sfn|Greenspahn|2016|p=380}} For example, Exodus 12:30 states that the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt, while Paul in the New Testament says the 430 years covers the period from Abraham to Moses.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}}
* The earlier part of the Bible's history contradicts science and known history (the world is not 6,000 years old as the Biblical chronology suggests, the ages of the patriarchs in Genesis are far longer than is reasonable, and serious historians of Israel's history no longer regard the exodus, the conquest of Canaan, or the entire period prior to David as real history).
* Very few events in the Bible are mentioned in outside sources, making it difficult to move from a relative chronology (X happened before Y happened) to an absolute one (X happened in a known year).

==Tables==
The Bible measures events from the year of God's creation of the world, a type of calendar called [[Anno Mundi]] ("Year of the World"), shortened as AM. The task of a literal biblical chronology is to convert this to dates in the modern chronology expressed as years before or after Christ, BC and AD. There have been many attempts to do this, none of them universally accepted. The following tables (derived from Thomas L. Thompson, ''The Mythic Past''; notes within the table as cited) divide the Bible's AM dates by the three periods into which they most naturally fall.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=75}}

| style="text-align:left;"|From Creation to the birth of Abraham time is calculated by adding the ages of the Patriarchs when their first child is born.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|p=124}} It seems possible that the period of the Flood is not meant to be included in the count – Shem, born 100 years before the Flood, "begot" his first son two years after it, which should make him 102, but Genesis 11:10-11 specifies that he is only 100, suggesting that time has been suspended.{{sfn|Guillaume|2007|p=6,252-253}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A literal chronology would put the creation of the world about 4000 BCE and the Flood about 2300 BCE.{{sfn|Matthews|1996|p=302fn18}} The best-known attempt to provide a date for Creation is probably that of Archbishop [[Ussher chronology|James Ussher]], who placed it 4004 BCE, but there are many alternatives, including [[Isaac Newton]] in 4000 BCE, [[Martin Luther]] in 3961 BCE, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE, and the traditional Greek Orthodox date, based on the Septuagint, of 5009 BCE.{{sfn|Day|2014|p=3-4}} The dates given to subsequent events such as the Flood will depend on this initial date.

===Abraham's entry into Canaan to the foundation of Solomon's temple===

| style="text-align:left;"|Entrance into Egypt&lt;br&gt;Exodus&lt;br&gt;Foundation of Solomon's Temple
| style="text-align:left;"|The 215 years between Abraham's call to enter Canaan (AM 2021) and Jacob's entry into Egypt (AM 2236) are calculated from the ages of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob provided in Genesis; the 430 year period in Egypt is stated in Exodus 12:40, although [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] in the New Testament says that the 430 years covers the entire period from Abraham to the exodus.{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The Exodus (AM 2666) occurs exactly two-thirds of the way through the 4,000 years from the Creation to the rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE, marking it as the pivotal event of the chronology.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}} It is also two-thirds of the way through the 40 notional "generations" of 100 years each making up the 4,000 years, with Aaron, the first High Priest, being the 26th generation from Adam.{{sfn|Johnson|2002|p=32}}&lt;br&gt;
A literal reading of the Biblical chronology would place the Exodus about 1446 BCE, on the basis of the statement in 1 Kings 6:1 that the Temple was founded 480 years after the Exodus.{{sfn|Reed|2011|p=107}} From this a literal chronology can deduce dates for the entry into Canaan 40 years later and the birth of Moses 80 years earlier. It seems impossible, however, to reconcile the 430 years in Egypt with the Bible's information (Exodus 12:40) that this involved only four generations.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=28}}

| style="text-align:left;"|Foundation of the Temple&lt;br&gt;(The Hebrew kings)&lt;br&gt;Destruction of the Temple&lt;br&gt;Re-foundation of the Temple&lt;br&gt;Re-dedication of the Temple
| The period from the foundation of the Temple to its destruction, 430 years, is found by adding the reigns of the kings of Judah from the fourth year of Solomon (the year of the Temple's foundation).{{sfn|Barr|2001|p=97}} The fourth year of Solomon came exactly 1,200 years after the birth of Abraham (Abraham was born in AM 1946 if the two years of the Flood are excluded),{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=30}} and there were exactly 20 kings in both Judah and Israel following Solomon, despite Judah lasting more than a century longer than Israel.{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=26-27}} The complete chronology seems to point towards the re-dedication of the Temple by the Maccabees in 164 BCE bringing the chronology to AM 4000, from which the entire cycle is calculated backwards.{{sfn|Thompson|2007|p=74}}{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2006|p=87}}&lt;br&gt;

The chronology of the monarchy, unlike that of earlier periods, can be checked against non-Biblical sources and seems to be correct in general terms.{{sfn|Lemche|2010|p=95-96}} This raises the prospect that the [[Books of Kings]] can be used to reconstruct a chronology for the monarchy, but the task has in fact proven intractably difficult.{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=2}} The problem is that the books contain numerous contradictions: to take just one example, since Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel began to rule at the same time (1 Kings 12), and since Ahaziah of Judah and Joram of Israel were killed at the same time (1 Kings 9:24, 27), the same amount of time should have elapsed in both kingdoms, but the count shows 95 years passing in Judah and 98 in Israel.{{sfn|Galil|1996|p=12}} In short, "[t]he data concerning the synchronisms appeared in hopeless contradiction with the data as to the lengths of reigns."{{sfn|Thiele|1983|p=15}} Possibly the most widely followed attempt to resolve the problems is [[Edwin R. Thiele]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (three editions between 1951 and 1983), but his work has been widely criticised for, among other things, introducing "innumerable" co-regencies, constructing a "complex system of calendars", and using "unique" patterns of calculation; as a result his following is largely among scholars "committed ... to a doctrine of scripture's absolute harmony" (the criticism is to be found in [[Brevard Childs]]' ''Introduction to the Old Testament as Scripture'').{{sfn|Tetley|2005|p=4 and fn.6}} Subsequent scholars continue to propose alternative chronologies, but, in the words of a recent commentary on Kings, there is "little consensus on acceptable methods of dealing with conflicting data."{{sfn|Konkel|2010|p=673}}&lt;br&gt;

== Example of literalist chronology ==

The following tabulation of years and dates is according to the literal letter of the text of the Bible alone. Links to multiple translations and versions are provided for verification. For comparison, known historically dated events are associated with the resultant literal dates. Dates according to the famous [[Ussher chronology]] appear in small type italics "''{{small|A.M.}}''" (Latin: "''Year of the World''"), "''{{small|Ante C.}}''" (Latin: "''Before Christ''"). In ancient Israel a part year was designated as the previous king's last year and the new king's 1st year. The arithmetic can be checked by starting at the bottom of the table with the date of the destruction of the Temple in 587 and adding the number of years in the Scriptures (books of the ''Prophets'' and ''Chronicles'' through ''Genesis'') back up to the beginning. Dates with ''events in italics'' appearing in ''{{small|small type}}'' for historical comparison are according to Bernard Grun's ''The Timetables of History''. For the period after 587 BCE known historical dates are used as referents. Biblical source texts for stated numbers of years are referenced and linked. Reference sources are the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition|RSVCE]],&lt;ref&gt;''Revised Standard Version'', © 1966 Division of Christian Education of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, published by Thomas Nelson Publishers for Ignatius Press, {{ISBN|0-89870-490-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Saint Joseph Edition of The New American Bible | publisher = [[Catholic Book Publishing|Catholic Book Publishing Co.]], New York, N.Y. | year = 1987, 1980, 1970 by the [[Confraternity of Christian Doctrine]], Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Timetables of History'' by [[Bernard Grun]], and the ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'' (2003).

|The [[Book of Joshua|conquest of Canaan]], a period of 32 (?) years, beginning with [[Jericho]] (1536). &lt;br/&gt; The Bible does not state the number of the years of the conquest of Canaan during the lifetime of Joshua, only that Joshua was 110 years old when he died.
*''See'' [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] and [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] &lt;br/&gt; [[John Garstang]] and [[Kathleen Kenyon]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to [[carbon-dating]], Jericho (Jericho City IV) was destroyed between 1617 and 1530 BCE. The site remained uninhabited (Joshua's curse ? {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|6:26}}) until the city was refounded in the 9th century BCE. John Garstang determined that Jericho was destroyed by fire around 1400 BCE, corresponding to the biblical dating of the Israelite conquest current at that time. Kathleen Kenyon's findings disagreed with Garstang and the accepted biblical dating, and she dated the destruction and the city wall to a much earlier time, in the 1600–1500s, c. 1550. But she believed that the Exodus and the conquest under Joshua took place in the 1200s and declared that, since the city had already been long uninhabited through the entire 13th century, it was impossible that Jericho had been destroyed by Joshua according to the biblical account. "While critical scholars underline the conflict between archaeological data and the biblical conquest narrative, in reality there is no conflict here."—Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell. &lt;br/&gt; —''Source'': "Jericho", Karen Joines and Eric Mitchell, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 885–888. &lt;br/&gt; Israeli-Canadian journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]]  (''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'', 2006) pointed out that if researchers of the future insisted that the American Civil War took place at the time of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States in the 1960s at the time of the Vietnam War, and then looked for evidence supporting occurrence of the Civil War at that time, they would find none, and the presidency of Abraham Lincoln would be regarded as only legendary. If chronological dating provided by a more literal reading of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' were taken seriously, then concrete archaeological evidence for the historical accuracy of the biblical text would become more evident: "It's staring them in the face, and they don't recognize it."&lt;/ref&gt;

|"''...the people served the LORD...all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua...and there arose a generation after them, who did not know the LORD....''"
*A plain, explicit meaning for the exact period of "''the days of the elders''" and of the "''generation after them''" cannot be drawn from the text of the Bible alone; the Bible text does not explicitly state the number of days of that generation. &lt;br/&gt; The "''300 years''" of Judges 11:26 is not useful here in determining the period of that generation and does not correspond to the literal numbering of the years stated plainly in all the chronological texts of the Bible tabulated from David back to Joshua, from ''2 Samuel'' through ''Joshua'' (Jephthah 1186 BCE back to Cushan-Rishathaim 1505 BCE: 1505–1186 BCE = 319 years). &lt;br/&gt; The "''450 years''" of Acts 13:19-20 for the period of the judges exactly corresponds to the literal tabulation of the years in this table, from 1505 BCE, after Joshua, to 1055 BCE, when David began to rule over all Israel and Judah (1505 – 1055 = 450), but it does not correspond to the literal tabulation of the years of the "''judges until Samuel the prophet''" 1115/1075 BCE. (1505–1115 BCE = 390 years, and 1505–1075 BCE = 430 years.) This text too is not useful in determining the number of days and length of years of the 2 generations after Joshua.

This is not explicitly stated in the [[Book of Judges]], which "plainly" relates their exploits solely as a ''sequential'' series of events, so that taking the texts literally, without recourse to the method of grammatico-historical exegesis, confronts uninstructed readers of the Bible with what appears to them to be an impossible inconsistency which can be unsettling.

::{{small|The Bible does not say that Nebuchadnezzar released Jehoiakim during or after his 3rd year to allow him to return to Jerusalem and then took him away a second time to Babylon in his 11th year—such a conclusion, however reasonable, is speculative only and cannot be drawn solely from a plain reading of the strict letter of the text of the Bible alone according to the method of letterism, which only presents an apparent inconsistency, but which entirely accords with the grammatico-historical method of exegesis which [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'' presumptively]] takes both texts as reliable, consistent and historically factual, and as such, provides an illustrative example of the difference in the two literalist methodologies.}} See [[Inference]].

"''between the sea and the glorious holy mountain...he shall come to his end with none to help him.''"—"''...among the mountains in a strange land.''" A majority of Biblical scholars maintain that Daniel wrongly prophesied that Antiochus would die in Palestine.]]Daniel's prophesy of the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes "''among the mountains in a strange land''" ({{bibleverse|2|Maccabees|9:28|63}}; {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45|ESV}}) is [[Controversy|controverted]]. Daniel 11:45 does not specify which "''sea''". Some students of the Bible [{{small|source: "Daniel", S. Miller, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary''}}] identify Antiochus literally with Daniel 11:21-44, which accords with the description of his policies and actions in 1 and 2 Maccabees. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16 and 2 Maccabees 9:1-16, 28 shows that Antiochus died travelling on the [[Silk Road|great east-west highway]] running through Persia, northeast of Judea and [[Mount Zion]] and southwest of the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the mountainous Zagros region of Persia between [[Ecbatana]] and Babylon. It is evident that he did not die in Palestine between Mount Zion and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Traditionally, "''the sea''" and "''the great sea''" in the Bible is the Mediterranean ({{bibleverse||Joshua|1:4|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|9:1|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:12|ESV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|15:47|ESV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|23:4|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:11|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|25:19-22|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:19|ESV}};{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:2-3|ESV}}; compare {{bibleverse||Joel|2:20|ESV}} "''eastern sea''" and "''western sea''", and {{bibleverse||Micah|7:12|ESV}} "''from sea to sea''"). This is the understanding of a majority of Old Testament Biblical scholars such as [[Choon-Leong Seow|C. L. Seow]] [{{small|''Daniel'', 2003, [[Westminster John Knox Press]], Louisville, Kentucky, ISBN 978-0-664-25675-3}}], and [[John J. Collins]], Peter W. Flint, and others [{{small|''[http://www.brill.com/book-daniel-volume-1-composition-and-reception The Book of Daniel: Volume 1 Composition and Reception]'', 2000, BRILL, ISBN 978-90-04-11675-7}}] who hold that Daniel 11:45 refers to the mountains of Judea between Mount Zion and the Mediterranean Sea, or more specifically to Mount Zion, and conclude that the prophesy that Antiochus would die in Palestine "is totally inaccurate" since he died in Persia. Bible translations of this passage differ: some have Antiochus pitching his pavilion "''between the seas''", others have it "''on the glorious holy mountain''", while others more literally have it "''between the glorious holy mountain and the sea''" (see variant translations at {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:44-45}}). The conclusion of most Old Testament scholars is that the account in Daniel 11 is completely accurate through verse 44, but wrong in verse 45, and therefore it must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem. But this scholarly reading of "''the sea''" as the Mediterranean, and those translations having Antiochus' pavilion "''on/in the glorious holy mountain (Zion)''" in Palestine, are simply dismissed as wrong by a literalist plain reading of the Biblical text ([[Context (language use)|context]]) as it relates to the death of Antiochus among the mountains of Persia "''in a strange land''" between the Caspian Sea and Mount Zion. —''Sources'': &lt;br/&gt; "Mediterranean Sea", Philip Lee, ''Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary'', pp. 1097–1098. &lt;br/&gt;"Daniel, book of", Stephen R.

*2 Maccabees 1:13-16 relates the death of [[Antiochus X Eusebes]] and his men, during the course of a military expedition, as locked inside the temple of [[Nanaya|Nanea]] in Persia, stoned to death and beheaded by the priests.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Mahlon H. Smith]] states that Antiochus X Eusebes died fighting the [[Parthian Empire]] (which included Persian territory). See [http://virtualreligion.net/iho/antiochus_10.html Antiochus X Eusebes: ''Mahlon H. Smith''].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{small|This Antiochus should not be confused with the earlier Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who failed to take Elymais and its temple, and afterward died of parasitic infection and decay in the mountains of Persia. 1 Maccabees 6:1-16; 2 Maccabees 9:1-10, 28.}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some scholars (''The New American Bible'' for example) believe that the ''Antiochus'' referred to in this text of 2 Macc. 1:14 was Antiochus IV Epiphanes: "'''''1, 14-17''': A different account of the death of Antiochus IV is given in 2 Mc 9, 1-29 and another variant account in 1 Mc 6, 1-16. The writer of this letter'' [2 Macc. 1:10–2:18 one copy to Aristobulus in Jerusalem, one copy to the Jews in Egypt] ''probably heard a distorted rumor of the king's death. This fact and other indications show that the letter was written very soon after Antiochus IV died, hence in 164 B.C.'' —New American Bible, 2 Maccabees 1:14–17, footnote. &lt;br/&gt; As with the text of Daniel 11:45, a literalist interpretation of 2 Maccabees rejects the scholarly view of a "''distorted rumor''" in favor of an "inerrant" reading that takes the narrative as an accurate report, and therefore as not referring to the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, but to the actual death of another Antiochus who was slain by Parthians in the (Syrian) region of [[Parthian Empire#Rome and Armenia|Persia/the Parthian Empire]] in the temple of Nanaya. The extra-biblical evidence cited by Mahlon H. Smith and others regarding the circumstances of the death of Antiochus X tends to support this literalist view, but this is currently a minority opinion.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Contour buffer strips NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Contour buffer strips used to retain soil and reduce erosion.]]

A '''buffer strip''' is an area of land maintained in permanent [[vegetation]] that helps to control [[air quality index|air]], [[soil quality|soil]], and [[water quality]], along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in [[agriculture]]. Buffer strips trap [[sediment]], and enhance [[filtration]] of [[nutrient]]s and [[pesticide]]s by slowing down [[surface runoff|runoff]] that could enter the local [[surface water]]s. The [[root|root systems]] of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]] and stabilize [[stream bed|stream banks]] providing protection against substantial [[erosion]] and [[landslide]]s. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing [[crop]] fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.

Buffer strips can have several different configurations of vegetation found on them varying from simply grass to combinations of grass, trees, and shrubs. Areas with diverse vegetation provide more protection from nutrient and pesticide flow and at the same time provide better [[biodiversity]] amongst [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), (2000). [http://www.wsi.nrcs.usda.gov/products/W2Q/pest/docs/newconbuf.pdf "Conservation Buffers to Reduce Pesticide Losses."] March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodstock Conservation Commission (2000). [http://www.woodstockconservation.org/buffer_strips.htm Buffer Strips- Common Sense Conservation.] Town of Woodstock, CT. Retrieved 2009-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many country, state, and local governments provide financial [[incentive]]s for [[conservation movement|conservation programs]] such as buffer strips because they help stabilize the environment even when the land is being used. Buffer strips not only stabilize the land but can also provide a visual demonstration that land is under [[stewardship]].

==Types==
===Buffers within fields===

A [[grassed waterway]] reduces soil erosion and captures most nutrients and pesticides that would normally wash out of crop fields and into major waters. These waterways help to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to an area where it will have a stable outlet.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; Outlets must be adequate enough to allow water to drain without ponding or flooding the area being protected, while also preventing erosion of the water into the outlet which can be accomplished through the use of [[riprap]]. A limitation is during large runoff events, when soil is saturated, grassed waterways will have a very concentrated flow of water making them not as effective during high rainfalls. Grassed waterways require very little maintenance once they are introduced with major upkeep being mowing of the grass and reseeding. Farm machinery and cattle can cross these waterways but it may be hazardous during wet periods. One of the major disadvantages of waterways are actually getting them established. A late summer or early fall seeding when rainfall is minimal is recommended to allow the seed to have the best chance at establishing a root system.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, R. (1994). [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/engineer/facts/94-039.htm "Fact Sheet: Grassed Waterways."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807220249/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/engineer/facts/94-039.htm |date=August 7, 2007 }} Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Order No. 94-039.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contour buffer strips are strips of perennial vegetation alternated with wider cultivated strips of cropland. This type of buffer strip is most effective when runoff water enters uniformly as sheetflow.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; They are very adapted to trapping pesticides and reducing [[Water erosion|rill erosion]]. These buffers need to be at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide and make up for 20 to 30 percent of slope of an area. A lot of the time contour buffers can be used as a very inexpensive substitute for terraces. Most of the time a grass is selected that can be harvested during mid-summer. These buffers are not permanent and can be moved up and down hillsides from season to season in order to re-establish vegetation.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

===Edge of field buffers===
Vegetative barriers are narrower buffer strips of hardy, native, perennial grasses or shrubs planted in parallel rows to crops.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, K.D. et al. (1999). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T3X-3WG31V3-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1999&amp;_alid=922970396&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=4958&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=61b71abf24cf643b417eb4f9b686f503 "Study on the performance of contour vegetative barriers in an arid region using numerical models."] ''Agricultural Water Management,'' 41:1, June 1999. {{DOI|10.1016/S0378-3774(98)00114-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They are very effective in reducing wind and water erosion which results in sediment trapping and water infiltration. They function in similar fashion to a contour buffer strip, just much narrower.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

Field borders are bands or strips of perennial vegetation that is found on the edge of a cropland field. Field borders help with runoff only when it flows over the strip. They’re very effective in benefiting spraying operations because they allow for extra room between adjacent fields. They also provide room for farming equipment to turn around. Field borders are effective in reducing wind and water erosion and provide great wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

Filter strips are areas of grass or other permanent vegetation that protect riparian areas from sediment runoff, pesticides, pathogens, organics and nutrients. These strips are very important in protecting stream banks and water quality. Filter strips work best when other conservation practices are used in order to drain water in their direction.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt; Filter strips were originally used mostly in agriculture, but now are a common practice in urban areas where water quality has become an increasingly important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Watershed Protection (1997).

{{Main|Riparian buffer}}
Riparian forest buffers are diverse communities of trees, shrubs and native perennial grasses. They are great for providing habitat for wildlife on land and in the water. Taller trees next to the streams help to lower water temperatures with shade which improves aquatic communities. The shrubs and grasses help to slow flooding and the larger trees can sometimes intercept nitrates before they reach the water with their deep roots.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

===Wind buffers===
{{Main|Windbreak}}
The main purpose of a windbreak or a shelterbelt is to protect areas from wind causing erosion on the bare soil of croplands. Windbreaks can also serve as an area that separates fields and protects them from spray drift of pesticides.&lt;ref name="NRCS2000" /&gt;

==Wildlife habitat==
Buffer strips are very important in helping to provide [[habitat]] for many species of [[wildlife]] in the open farm lands by causing an [[edge effect]]. With much of the land open on farms having an edge allows a safe-haven for animals to move between different [[ecosystems]]. Buffers are also helpful in conserving [[biodiversity]] especially to that of rare or endangered species through the incorporation of native grasses into their seeding by the landowner. [[:Category:Native grasses of California|Native grasses]] are especially important to [[pheasant]]s, [[quail]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]] and [[songbird]]s because they provide the foods they need as well as the shelter from predators. Since most buffer strip areas have limited disturbance from farming it allows for a shelter to hide year round for many of the species including insects, birds, and mammals. When buffers run into and follow [[riparian]] areas along stream beds it is important to have larger vegetation like trees and shrubs that shade the water from the open sun. The water is then able to be cooler allowing for greater fish production and other [[aquatic plants]] and other biota to thrive in a less disturbed environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/waters/buffer_strips.pdf |title=revision5_11-7-07_buffer strips.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area of vegetation following a body of water is noted as a [[riparian zone]]. These buffer areas often incorporate large trees that protect stream banks from excessive erosion and shade aquatic areas. The shade provided by the larger trees reduces water temperatures and light intensity from [[ultraviolet]] light. Debris including leaves and branches that fell from trees, often contain aquatic invertebrates important to the structure of the water following the "River Continuum" concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rivercontinuum.org/files/RCC.178151255.pdf |title=Data |website=www.rivercontinuum.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the riparian zones contain a larger variety of plants the overall diversity is much greater as well. With more [[photosynthesis]] and higher amounts of available water plant primary production can increase in turn creating more potential food for the wildlife &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Riparian_zone |title=Riparian zone |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planted vegetation==

The [[USDA]] shows that grassed waterways of less than 5% slopes for a chosen waterway will greatly reduce velocity of draining water within the land.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/grassedwtrway.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) offers the use of an online [[Soil survey]] to view the area of land to be planted and examine slope and soil drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm |title=Web Soil Survey - Home |publisher=Websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As viewed by the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]], soil drainage is the number one priority for location of certain grasses. Poorer drainage causes less infiltration of water into the soil as [[groundwater recharge]] causing ponding and flooding of surrounding crops. Higher drainage becomes more droughty which hinders the establishment of certain grasses good for waterways. Medium soil drainage becomes the most suitable for planting. Determining exact grasses and seed amounts to plant follows specifications of a local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide and the Contour Buffer practice standard while taking practice on land and regional environmental conditions into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov/pubs/lapmctn7260.pdf |title=Info |website=www.plant-materials.nrcs.usda.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRCS has shown contour strip cropping provides the greatest effectiveness when slopes of the area are within 4-8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awqa.org/pubs/conservation/NRCSPractices/ContourBufferStrips.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025031/http://www.awqa.org/pubs/conservation/NRCSPractices/ContourBufferStrips.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For greater success in lowering the erosion, contour strips on the slopes need to follow the [[contour line|contours]] of the landscape. Row crops like [[maize|corn]], [[legumes]], or [[soybeans]] should alternate strips of small grains or forages to successfully limit erosion and slowing or capturing the runoff of [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]]. Tests from the NRCS have shown that the smaller tighter rooted grasses and [[hay]]s provide more surface cover to prevent rain and wind erosion while slowing runoff, increasing infiltration, and trapping sediment from the high erosive row crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.or.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/conservation-planning-and-conservation-records/contourstripcropping.html |title=Contour Stripcropping &amp;#124; Oregon NRCS |publisher=Or.nrcs.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220121959/http://www.or.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/conservation-planning-and-conservation-records/contourstripcropping.html |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper planting of the contour crops is important for higher success of erosion control to protect highly fertile [[topsoil]].

'''CANpie''' (CAN Programming Interface Environment) is an [[open source]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} project and pursues the objective of creating and establishing an open and standardized software API for access to the [[CAN bus]].

[[Image:CANpieFD_Logo.png|right|thumb|300px|CANpie FD logo]]
The project was established in 2001&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/canpie/files/?source=navbar&lt;/ref&gt; by MicroControl and is licensed under [[Apache License|Apache License Version 2.0]]. The current version of the CANpie API&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microcontrol.net/download/canpie/canpie_user_v3r00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; covers both classical CAN frames as well as [[CAN FD|ISO CAN FD]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.can-cia.org/fileadmin/resources/documents/proceedings/2012_hartwich.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; frames. The API is designed for embedded control applications as well as for PC interface boards: embedded [[microcontroller]]s are programmed in C, a C++ API is provided for OS independent access to interface boards. The API provides ISO/OSI Layer-2 (Data Link Layer) functionality. It is not the intention of CANpie to incorporate higher layer functionality (e.g. [[CANopen]], [[SAE J1939]]).

==Driver Principle==
The CANpie API supports the concept of hardware message buffers (mailboxes) with a total limit of 255 buffers. A message buffer has a unique direction (receive or transmit).  As an option it is possible to connect a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] with arbitrary size to a message buffer for both transfer directions. The total number of CAN channels is limited to 255, the API provides a method to gather information about the features of each CAN hardware channel. This is especially important for an application designer who wants to write the code only once. The CAN frame time-stamping (specified by [[CAN in Automation|CiA]] 603, CAN Frame time-stamping – Requirements for network time management&lt;ref&gt;https://www.can-cia.org/standardization/specifications/&lt;/ref&gt;) is supported with a resolution of 1 nano-second.

==Usage==
[[Image:canpie_structure.png|right|thumb|300px|CANpie Structure]]
The following code snippet shows the initialisation of a microcontroller.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c" style="margin-right: 320px;"&gt;

#include "cp_core.h"  // CANpie core functions

void MyCanInit(void)
{
   CpPort_ts  tsCanPortT;   // logical CAN port
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // setup the CAN controller / open a physical CAN
   // port
   //
   memset(&amp;tsCanPortT, 0, sizeof(CpPort_ts));
   CpCoreDriverInit(eCP_CHANNEL_1, &amp;tsCanPortT, 0);
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // setup 500 kBit/s
   //
   CpCoreBitrate(&amp;tsCanPortT,
                 eCP_BITRATE_500K,
                 eCP_BITRATE_NONE);
   //---------------------------------------------------
   // start CAN operation
   //
   CpCoreCanMode(&amp;tsCanPortT, eCP_MODE_OPERATION);
   //.. now we are operational
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Similar projects==
For the [[Linux]] operating system the projects [[can4linux]] and [[SocketCAN]] provide support for Classical CAN and ISO CAN FD. The commercial [[Autosar|AUTOSAR]] specification supports CAN FD since version 4.3 and is available only for AUTOSAR partners. The CMSIS-Driver (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) specification is a software API that describes peripheral driver interfaces for middleware stacks and user applications on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] Cortex-M processors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capital improvement plan''' ('''CIP'''), or '''capital improvement program''', is a short-range plan, usually four to ten years, which identifies capital projects and equipment purchases, provides a planning schedule and identifies options for financing the plan. Essentially, the plan provides a link between a
[[municipality]], [[school district]], [[municipal parks|parks and recreation department]] and/or other local government entity and a comprehensive and [[strategic plan]] and the entity's annual [[budget]].

==Benefits==
A CIP provides many benefits including: 
* Allows for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time. 
* The ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing costs. 
* Serve as a public relations and economic development tool. 
* A focus on preserving a governmental entity's [[infrastructure]] while ensuring the efficient use of [[public funds]]. 
* An opportunity to foster cooperation among departments and an ability to inform other units of government of the entity's priorities. For example, it is not uncommon for a large city or county to incorporate into its CIP the capital needs of a school district, parks and recreation department and/or some other public service structure.

==Features==
The CIP typically includes the following information:

* A listing of the capital projects or equipment to be purchased
* The projects ranked in order of preference
* The plan for financing the projects
* A timetable for the construction or completion of the project
* Justification for the project
* Explanation of expenses for the project

==Overall process==
Prior to undertaking the development of the CIP, the government entity will want to define the criteria for what kind of projects or equipment are to be included and organize a process for developing the plan. What is defined as a capital project or capital purchase may vary from city to county to district to state depending on the size of the local government provisioning the plan. Generally, they will be tangible items that have a life expectancy greater than one year.

A local government will also need to forecast where it believes it will face future demands and growth, which will involve an inventory of existing facilities, infrastructure and equipment. In addition, a local government will want to develop basic policies for implementing the plan. Because the CIP includes financing issues, the municipality may want to seek advice from their financial advisor and/or bond counsel. A review of the municipality's current finances is also vital.

Once the CIP is finalized, the local government may be required to hold a [[town meeting|public hearing]] before the plan is adopted by a [[city council]], a board of regents and/or a bond review commission.

==Specific steps==
# Establish a capital planning committee with bylaws
# Take inventory of existing capital assets
# Evaluate previously approved, unimplemented or incomplete projects
# Assess financial capacity
# Solicit, compile and evaluate new project requests
# Prioritize projects
# Develop a financing plan
# Adopt a capital improvement program
# Monitor and manage approved projects within the CIP
# Update existing/ongoing capital programs

[[File:Catenaria in terra cruda a più corsi di conci.jpeg|400px|thumb|right|A [[mudbrick]] catenary arch]]
[[File:Hanging chain and arch.svg|400px|thumb|right|A [[catenary curve]] (left) and a catenary arch, also a catenary curve (right). One points up, and one points down, but the curves are the same.]]

A '''catenary arch''' is a type of [[architecture|architectural]] [[pointed arch]] that follows an inverted [[catenary curve]]. It is common in [[cathedral]]s and in [[Gothic arch]]es used in [[Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref name="American Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/the-perfect-dome|title=Letter to the Editors: The Perfect Dome|author=Handy, Richard L.|date=May 2011|work=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a [[parabolic arch]].

==In history==
[[File:17 Robert Hooke Engineer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|alt=Painting of Robert Hooke seated in a study, holding a small chain suspended between his hands by the ends|[[Robert Hooke]], holding a hanging [[chain]], which forms a catenary curve]]

The 17th-century scientist [[Robert Hooke]] wrote, "''Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum''", or, "As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch." &lt;ref name="The enigma of Robert Hooke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantumfrontiers.com/2015/08/31/the-enigma-of-robert-hooke/|title=The enigma of Robert Hooke|author=|date=31 August 2015|work=Quantum Frontiers|publisher=Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, California Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A note written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1788 reads, "I have lately received from Italy a treatise on the equilibrium of arches, by the Abbé Mascheroni. It appears to be a very scientifical work. I have not yet had time to engage in it; but I find that the conclusions of his demonstrations are, that every part of the [[catenary]] is in perfect equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|title=Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies, from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 2|date=1830|publisher=Gray and Bowen|location=Boston|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural properties==
What makes the catenary arch important is its ability to withstand weight.&lt;ref name="St. Louis Gateway Arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/history/us/monuments/stlouisarch/|title=St. Louis Gateway Arch|author=|date=|work=enchantedlearning.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strath.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.strath.ac.uk/j.wood/Biomimetics/Engineering%20Areas/structures/PROP%201_files/PROP%201.htm|title=Building an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=strath.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an arch of uniform density and thickness, supporting only its own weight, the catenary is the ideal curve.&lt;ref name="The inverted catenary arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonedome.com/?p=167|title=The inverted catenary arch|author=|date=|work=zonedome.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is done by a catenary curve: Catenary arches are strong, as they redirect the vertical force of gravity into compression forces pressing along the arch's curve. In a uniformly loaded catenary arch, the [[line of thrust]] runs through its center.&lt;ref name="Build an arch that can stand up by itself"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/files/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group1/catenary_arch/media/catenary_g.pdf|title=Build an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting the arch back into architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/203465/203465.pdf|title=Getting the arch back into architecture|author=Karl Robin Nilsson|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology''' ('''CMLRE''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]] under the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], [[Government of India]] with a mandate to study the marine living resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Call for research to protect marine life  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/12/03/stories/2010120362620300.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, apart from implementing various research projects of the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences|ministry]], the institute also manages and operates the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|Fishery Oceanographic Research Vessel (FORV) ''Sagar Sampada'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministry of Earth Sciences Overview |url=http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |date= |publisher=[[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] (MoES) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417153108/http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute has its origins in the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell, which was established under the then Department of Ocean Development, DOD (upgraded to the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] in 2006) for managing and co-ordinating activities of [[FORV Sagar Sampada]]. During the beginning of the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|Five Year Plan]] of the [[Government of India]] in 1998, the Marine Living Resources Programme (MLR Programme) was formulated by the DOD with a view of promoting ocean development activities in the country which inter-alia include mapping of the living resources, preparing inventory of commercially exploitable living marine resources, their optimum utilization through [[ecosystem management]] and R &amp; D in basic sciences on Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology. With the objective of implementing this programme, the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell was upgraded to the Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology. To this date, the research vessel [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] serves as the backbone of the MLR research activities co-ordinated by CMLRE.

During the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (1998-2002), the Centre co-ordinated the first systematic study of [[marine life]] along the [[India]]n [[continental shelf|shelf]] waters, along the  eastern and western coasts of India. The environmental characteristics of this region and the [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], marine [[benthos]], [[fishery]] resources etc. of this region were systematically characterized for the first time. During the 10th [[five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2002-2007) the exploration was extended to the [[continental slope]] regions, particularly in the case of marine [[benthos]] and [[fisheries]]. Research thrust was also placed on studies of [[harmful algal blooms]] and [[marine mammals]] around the Indian subcontinent. The environmental and productivity patterns around the Indian [[EEZ]] continued to be monitored and research on the productivity and [[fishery]] resources of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman and Nicobar regions]] was also carried out. In January 2005, after the devastating [[2004 tsunami]] the institute along with [[National Institute of Oceanography, India|National Institute of Oceanography]] and School of Marine Sciences, [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]] (CUSAT), Kochi carried out the one of the first scientific studies regarding the impact of the tsunami on marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sagar Sampada to study impact of tsunami  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010507390500.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |date=5 Jan 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tsunami: Research vessel assessing damage to marine ecology|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/10tsunami4.htm |date=10 January 2005 |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th and 10th [[Five-Year plans of India|plan periods]], the CMLRE served chiefly as a co-ordinating and fund granting agency, managing the projects that were granted to various other research institutes and universities.

During the 11th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2007-2012), the CMLRE established in-house R&amp;D activities, apart from co-ordination of projects in other institutes. In this period, focus was placed on continued monitoring of the [[pelagic]] environment and productivity, marine [[benthos]], [[harmful algal blooms]], studies on reproduction and recruitment of [[sardines]] in the south-east [[Arabian Sea]], deep-sea [[fisheries]] and [[myctophid]] resources in the Indian EEZ. Several projects during this period also focused on isolating and identifying [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compounds from marine organisms.

==Institute Mandate==
The Centre has the following mandate
* To develop management strategies for marine living resources through Ecosystem monitoring and modelling efforts.
* Evolving, coordinating and implementing time targeted national /regional R&amp;D programmes in the field of marine living resources and ecology through effective utilization of Fishery and Oceanographic Research Vessel Sagar Sampada.
* Strengthening of research on marine living resources and Ecology including establishment of a data centre for storage and dissemination of data/ information to end users.
* Coordinating the national programmes relating to Southern Ocean Living Resources (Antarctic marine living resources).

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
'''Church attendance''' is a central religious practice for many [[Christians]]; some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Catholic Church]] require church attendance on the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday); the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches [[first-day Sabbatarianism]],&lt;ref name="Wigley1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigley|first=John|title=The Rise and Fall of the Victorian Sunday|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719007941|page=800|quote=Following the formulation of the Westminster Confession, fully fledged Sabbatarianism quickly took root too, being embodied in an Act of 1661, then spreading northwards and westwards as the Highlands were opened up after the '45, during which time the doctrine lost its original force and vigour in the Lowlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus proclaiming the duty of public worship in keeping with the [[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name="McKim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=More Presbyterian Questions, More Presbyterian Answers: Exploring Christian Faith|year=2011|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664503086|page=72|quote=The Westminster Confession urges a strict observance of the Lord's Day as a day of rest and worship, away from "works, words, and thoughts" about "worldly employments and recreations." The whole time is to be devoted to "public and private exercises of [God's) worship, and in duties of necessity and mercy" (''BC'' 6.119). In the United States, many "blue laws" relating to Sunday originated from this general prescription observed by American Puritans of the Reformed tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The General Rules of the Methodist Church also requires "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God".&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1791, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] required attendance at [[church service]]s of the [[Church of England]] (the mother Church of the [[Anglican Communion]] and a [[state Church]]) at least twice a year.&lt;ref name="Day2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Cathy|title=Wiltshire Marriage Patterns 1754-1914: Geographical Mobility, Cousin Marriage and Illegitimacy|date=26 September 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443867924|page=198|quote=Attendance at an Anglican church service at least twice a year was a legal requirement for all people until 1791 and some parishioners endured the minimum church attendance requirement in order to avoid a fine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, all major branches of [[Christianity]], however, encourage church attendance, with one Christian apostolate providing the following biblical imperatives:

The [[Lutheran]] Christian theologian [[:da:Balthasar Münter|Balthasar Münter]] stated that church attendance is the "foundation for the Christian life" as "the [[Christian Bible]] and the [[sacraments]] provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of [[backsliding]], as well as offers "the [[Communion (Christian)|company of other believers]]".&lt;ref name="Roos2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Merethe|title=Enlightened Preaching: Balthasar Münter’s Authorship 1772-1793|date=2013-03-08|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004249899|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey commissioned by the ''Época Magazine'' in 2005 showed that 29% of [[Brazil]]ians attend church weekly, and indicated that it is lesser than in the United States but higher than in Western Europe and Japan, indeed showing that contrary to the local popular belief, Brazilians of the time could indeed be regarded as a religious people even in practice (though it is ponderable that the growth of the population declaring to be solely irreligious in nationwide censuses grew about 100% between 2000 and 2010, and 200% between 2000 and 2013, from 4% to 12%, and general secularization also grew among the portion of the population that remained religious).&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EDR70422-6014,00.html Época – O brasileiro em números {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210647/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0%2C%2CEDR70422-6014%2C00.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006, ''Financial Times (FT)/Harris Poll'' conducted online surveyed 12,507 adults over 16 years old in the United States (2,010 U.S. adults were surveyed) and five European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Great Britain and Spain).

Calculating the church's average weekend attendance is important since it determines the size of a given church. For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes]. ''USA Churches.org''. Accessed on January 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternative definitions, such as house church, simple church, intentional community, were proposed by [[the Barna Group]], an American private consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barna.org/barna-update/congregations/45-new-statistics-on-church-attendance-and-avoidance New Statistics on Church Attendance and Avoidance]. ''Barna Group'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) A narrow definition of a regular church attendee can be viewed as a synonym for a Sunday service visitation, while a broad definition, names as a regular attendee a person who comes to church during three out of eight weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rebecca and Lindy Lowry.

===Attendance by country===
The frequency at which Christians attend church services varies greatly around the world. In some countries weekly attendance at religious services is common among Christians, while in others weekly attendance is rare. The following attendance statistics are mostly based on self-reporting surveys and may not accurately reflect real attendance figures.

==Demographics ==
[[File:Lucia procession.jpg|thumb|250px|A Swedish Christian girl leads a [[Christian procession|church procession]] on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]]]
Church attendance remains stronger among older demographics, and more common for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?sitemapid=137 Gender profile of church attenders].

The [[Pew Research Center]], which conducts the extensive research and information program ''Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life'', has linked regular church attendance with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/5-3/ How Income and Church Attendance Affects Happiness]. ''Pewsocialtrends.org'', November 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies associated church attendance with decreased risk of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoconger.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/church-attendance-helps-combat-depression-study-finds/ Church attendance helps combat depression study finds], ''The Church of England Newspaper'', May 28, 2010 p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Rita W.

A 2005 European Union survey found that religious belief increased with age and was higher among women, those who were leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Iona Institute]] documented increasing church attendance in Ireland, despite sex-abuse scandals that plagued the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="The Iona Institute"&gt;[http://www.ionainstitute.eu/assets/files/Press_Release_by_The_Iona_Institute_2Nov2009-1.pdf ''Press Release by the Iona Institute'', 2 November 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest{{who|date=December 2016}} the rise is due to the effects of the economic recession.

Research shows that there is a correlation between church attendance and the level of education. For instance, in a Pew Research study from 1996, approximately 34% of high school dropouts went to church on a typical Sunday, while 44% of those with a college degree or higher did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/96KOHUT/96KOHUT_Var63_1.asp Religion and Politics Survey, 1996]. ''The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)''. Accessed on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of married individuals attended church on a typical Sunday, compared with 29% of divorced and 31% of never-married individuals. While it is likely that the well-educated and married might over-report their church attendance more often, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that they have maintained a stronger church-going identity than other Americans. A number of studies have been undertaken to examine the topic of [[religiosity and intelligence]] and religiosity and education. Studies also indicate that there is a higher rate of church attendance among married couples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Influence of parents ===

Several research studies in the USA and Europe found that church attendance practices of parents, especially fathers, can be highly influential in forming the future church attendance practices of their children.

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Fertility and Family Survey]] was commissioned by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)]] to enable Switzerland to take part in this international project launched by the [[UNECE Population Activities Unit]]. The survey was conducted between October 1994 and May 1995, with the results being published in 2000 by the [[Council of Europe]].  The results are representative of Switzerland's permanent resident population aged 20–49 and presented in the table below.&lt;ref name="HaugCourbage2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Haug|author2=Philippe Wanner|title=The Demographic Characteristics of National Minorities in Certain European States|url=https://book.coe.int/eur/en/population-studies-series/1949-the-demographic-characteristics-of-national-minorities-in-certain-european-states-volume-2-population-studies-no-31.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Population Studies No. 31|volume=Volume 2|date=January 2000|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Germany|isbn=978-92-871-4159-0|page=154|chapter=IV.

A non-practicing mother with a regular father will see a minimum of two-thirds of her children ending up at church. In contrast, a non-practicing father with a regular mother will see two-thirds of his children not attending church. If his wife is similarly irregular that figure rises to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Men &amp; Church | journal = Touchstone | date = June 2003 | first = Robbie | last = Low | volume = 16 | issue = 5| id=| url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-05-024-v |publisher= The Fellowship of St. James| accessdate = 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egan |first=Richard |url=http://www.ad2000.com.au/church_attendance_the_family_feminism_and_the_declining_role_of_fatherhood_september_2002 |title=Church Attendance: The family, feminism and the declining role of fatherhood |journal=AD2000 |volume=15 |issue=8 |date=September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American study found similar results on the impact of fathers:&lt;ref name="BruceBruce1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruce|first1=Robert|last2=Bruce|first2=Debra Fulghum|title=Becoming Spiritual Soulmates With Your Child|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y90JAAAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers |location=Nashville |isbn=978-0-8054-6269-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When both parents attend [[Sunday school]], 72% of the children attend Sunday school when grown.
*When only the father attends Sunday school, 55% of the children attend when grown.
*When only the mother attends Sunday school, 15% of the children attend when grown.
*When neither parent attends Sunday school, only 6% of the children attend when grown.

An unrelated survey in the USA also found fathers to be highly influential in church attendance. It found that if a child is the first person in a household to become a Christian, there is a 3.5% probability everyone else in the household will follow. If the mother is the first to become a Christian, there is a 17% probability everyone else in the household will follow. However, when the father is first, there is a 93% probability everyone else in the household will follow.&lt;ref name="HornerRalston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bob Horner|author2=Ron Ralston|author3=David Sunde|title=The promise keeper at work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CglElq-WtecC|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Promise Builders Study Series|date=December 1996|publisher=Focus on the Family Publishing|isbn=978-1-56179-451-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=15630 | title = Baptist Press: Want your church to grow?

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.&lt;ref name="Christian Research Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801010204/http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000242.cgi Why People Don't Go to Church... ].

An article published in the ''Christianity Today Magazine'' emphasized that at least in America church attendance since the 1990s has remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Baker. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/novemberweb-only/145-42.0.html Is Church Attendance Declining?], 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 50% of Americans replied that God is very important in their lives, comparing with 40% of Irish, 28% of Canadians, 26% of Spaniards, 21% of Australians, and 10% of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Michele. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BFWlhQRhQ6gC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Church+attendance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmXcUpOHKvK_sQTOj4H4Cg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Church%20attendance&amp;f=false Handbook of the Sociology of Religion]. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percent of Americans who regularly attend religious services has fluctuated over time, but presently is at a low point.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx Five Key Findings on Religion in the US], Gallup Poll (December 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gallup Poll]] surveys, the yearly aggregate of those who answer "yes" to the question "Did you, yourself, happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days, or not?" was 36% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx Religion], Gallup Poll (last accessed May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very long-running Gallup question: "In 1939, when Gallup first asked this question, 41% said 'yes.' That percentage dropped to 37% in 1940 and rose to 39% in 1950. It continued to climb, reaching as high as 49% at multiple points in the 1950s. Attendance then settled down to figures around 40% for decades, before dropping to 36%" beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name="Newport"/&gt;

The decline in church attendance is more pronounced in developed European countries, where it is suggested that the secular culture overrides interest in religion. In Poland Church attendance has declined from more than 50% in 1979 to 40% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Praktyki niedzielne Polaków (dominicantes)|url = http://iskk.pl/kosciolnaswiecie/211-praktyki-niedzielne-polakow-dominicantes.html|website = iskk.pl|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the early 1990s, American sociologists Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves found that weekly attendance at Protestant and Catholic churches in one rural county in [[Ohio]] was only about 20%, whereas self-reported church attendance was 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadaway |first1=C.

Kirk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings point to a bigger issue as many people in the world may be over-reporting church attendance because of their self-perception and identity as churchgoing people, indicating a certain psychological aspect to the over-reporting of church attendance. Although surveys of church attendance are aimed to study religious behavior, many respondents view them as questions about their identity. This is especially true among Americans who consider themselves "regular churchgoers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html The Church Attendance Gap: A look at two older studies whose findings should be taken more seriously] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130031340/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html |date=2013-11-30 }}.

'''Civic nationalism''', also known as '''liberal nationalism''', is a form of [[nationalism]] identified by [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] who believe in an inclusive form of [[nationalism]] that adheres with traditional liberal values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auer|first1=Stefan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134378602|page=5|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=BhNsM_ttOb4C&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

'''Clinical clerkships''' encompass a period of [[medical education]] in which students – [[medical student|medical]], [[nursing school|nursing]], [[dentistry school|dental]], or otherwise – practice medicine under the supervision of a health practitioner.&lt;ref name="unm-glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~unmreg/Curriculum/ScheduleTypeGlossary1-9-06.htm |title=Clinical clerkship |work=UNM Course Type Glossary |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical clerkships ==
In [[medical education]], a '''clerkship''', or '''rotation''', refers to the practice of [[medicine]] by [[medical students]] ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|D.P.M]]) during their final year(s) of study. Traditionally, the first half of [[medical school]] trains students in the classroom setting, and the second half takes place in a [[teaching hospital]]. Clerkships give students experiences in all parts of the hospital setting, including the [[operating room]], [[emergency department]], and various other departments that allow learning by viewing and doing.

During this training, students are required to rotate through different [[medical specialties]] and treat [[patient]]s under the supervision of [[physicians]].  Students elicit [[medical history|patient histories]], complete [[physical examination]]s, write [[progress note]]s, and assist in [[surgery|surgeries]] and [[medical procedure]]s. The work hours are that of a full-time job, generally similar to that of [[residency (medicine)|residents]]. Students may also be required to work on weekends and to be on call.
For [[medical student]]s, [[Clerkship (medicine)|clerkships]] occur after the [[basic science]] curriculum, and are supervised by medical specialists at a [[teaching hospital]] or [[medical school]]. Typically, certain clerkships are required to obtain the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree in the United States (e.g., [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]]), while others are elective (e.g., [[dermatology]], [[pathology]], and [[neurology]]).

The intent of the clinical clerkship is to teach the medical student the fundamentals of clinical examination, evaluation, and care provision, and to enable the student to select the course of further study. During the clinical clerkship, the medical student will interact with real patients much as a [[physician]] does, but their evaluation and recommendations will be reviewed and approved by more senior physicians.

===United States===
In the United States, [[Medical school in the United States|medical school]] typically lasts four years.  Medical students spend the third and fourth years rotating through a combination of required clerkship and electives.  Most medical schools require rotations in [[internal medicine]], [[surgery]], [[pediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[family medicine]], [[radiology]], and [[neurology]].  Some schools additionally require [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive-care medicine]].  Furthermore, a common graduation requirement is to complete a [[sub-internship]] in a specialty, where the medical student acts as an [[internship (medicine)|intern]].

A '''closed-household economy''' is a society's [[economic system]] in which goods are not traded. Instead, those goods are produced and consumed by the same households. In other words, a closed-household economy is an economy where households are closed to [[Trade|trading]]. This kind of economy is present, for example, in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.

The production and consumption of goods is not separated as in a society with high [[division of labor]].

The closed-household economy contrasts with a [[barter economy]], in which goods are bartered (traded against each other), and a [[monetary economy]], in which goods are traded for money.

The closed-household economy and the barter economy are together referred to as ''non-monetary economies''.

'''Confidentiality''' involves a set of rules or a promise usually executed through [[Non-disclosure agreement|confidentiality agreements]] that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of [[information]].

==Legal confidentiality==
{{main|Privacy law}}

Lawyers are often required by law to keep confidential anything pertaining to the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the [[attorney–client privilege|attorney–client evidentiary privilege]], which only covers ''communications'' between the attorney and the client.

Both the privilege and the duty serve the purpose of encouraging clients to speak frankly about their cases. This way, lawyers can carry out their duty to provide clients with zealous representation. Otherwise, the opposing side may be able to surprise the lawyer in court with something he did not know about his client, which may weaken the client's position. Also, a distrustful client might hide a relevant fact he thinks is incriminating, but that a skilled lawyer could turn to the client's advantage (for example, by raising [[affirmative defense]]s like self-defense)

However, most jurisdictions have exceptions for situations where the lawyer has reason to believe that the client may kill or seriously injure someone, may cause substantial injury to the financial interest or property of another, or is using (or seeking to use) the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud.

In such situations the lawyer has the discretion, but not the obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action. Most states have a version of this discretionary disclosure rule under Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6 (or its equivalent).

A few jurisdictions have made this traditionally discretionary duty mandatory. For example, see the New Jersey and Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6.

In some jurisdictions the lawyer must try to convince the client to conform his or her conduct to the boundaries of the law before disclosing any otherwise confidential information.

Note that these exceptions generally do not cover crimes that have already occurred, even in extreme cases where murderers have confessed the location of missing bodies to their lawyers but the police are still looking for those bodies. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] and many [[state supreme court]]s have affirmed the right of a lawyer to withhold information in such situations. Otherwise, it would be impossible for any criminal defendant to obtain a zealous defense.

California is famous for having one of the strongest duties of confidentiality in the world; its lawyers must protect client confidences at "every peril to himself [or herself]" under former California Business and Professions Code section 6068(e).  Until an amendment in 2004 (which turned subsection (e) into subsection (e)(1) and added subsection (e)(2) to section 6068), California lawyers were not even permitted to disclose that a client was about to commit murder or assault.  The Supreme Court of California promptly amended the California Rules of Professional Conduct to conform to the new exception in the revised statute.

Recent legislation in the UK curtails the confidentiality professionals like lawyers and accountants can maintain at the expense of the state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Accountants, for example, are required to disclose to the state any suspicions of fraudulent accounting and, even, the legitimate use of tax saving schemes if those schemes are not already known to the tax authorities.

===Breach of confidence in English law===
{{main|Breach of confidence in English law}}

The "three traditional requirements of the cause of action for breach of confidence"&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Campbell v MGN Ltd | link = Campbell v MGN Ltd | court = UKHL | year = 2004 | num = 22 | parallelcite = [2004] 2 AC 457}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|[19]}} were identified by [[Robert Megarry|Megarry J]] in ''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' (1968) in the following terms:&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;''Coco v A N Clark (Engineers) Ltd'' [1969] RPC 41; [1968] [[Fleet Street Reports: Cases on Intellectual Property Law|FSR]] 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|In my judgment, three elements are normally required if, apart from contract, a case of breach of confidence is to succeed. First, the information itself, in the words of Lord Greene, M.R. in the ''Saltman'' case on page 215, must "have the necessary quality of confidence about it." Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.}}

The 1896 case featuring the royal ''accoucheur'' Dr [[William Smoult Playfair]] showed the difference between lay and medical views. Playfair was consulted by Linda Kitson; he ascertained that she had been pregnant while separated from her husband. He informed his wife, a relative of Kitson's, in order that she protect herself and their daughters from moral contagion. Kitson sued, and the case gained public notoriety, with huge damages awarded against the doctor. &lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=35541|title=Playfair, William Smoult|first=Ann|last=Dally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical confidentiality==
Confidentiality is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients. Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing certain discussions with patients, even under oath in court.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/dr-coburns-peculiar-privi_b_308077.html Dr. Coburn's Peculiar Privilege], 2 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This [[physician-patient privilege]] only applies to secrets shared between physician and patient during the course of providing medical care.&lt;ref name="Coburn's"/&gt;

The rule dates back to at least the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which reads:  ''Whatever, in connection with my professional service, or not in connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge, as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.''

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.

===United States===
Confidentiality is standard in the United States by [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many American states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm Notification Laws] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429230410/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm |date=29 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV confidentiality===
In the United Kingdom information about an individual's HIV status is kept confidential within the NHS. This is based in law, in the NHS Constitution and in key NHS rules and procedures. It is also outlined in every NHS employee’s contract of employment and in professional standards set by regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/healthregulators/Pages/professional-standards-authority.aspx|title=Professional Standards Authority - Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National AIDS Trust's Confidentiality in the NHS: Your Information, Your Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf|title=Publications - National AIDS Trust - NAT|author=|date=|website=www.nat.org.uk|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines these rights. All registered healthcare professionals must abide by these standards and if they are found to have breached confidentiality, they can face disciplinary action.

A healthcare worker shares confidential information with someone else who is, or is about to, provide the patient directly with healthcare to make sure they get the best possible treatment. They only share information that is relevant to their care in that instance, and with consent.

There are two ways to give consent: ''explicit consent'' or ''implied consent''. Explicit consent is when a patient clearly communicates to a healthcare worker, verbally or in writing or in some other way, that relevant confidential information can be shared. Implied consent, means that a patient's consent to share personal confidential information is assumed. When personal confidential information is shared between healthcare workers, consent is taken as implied.

If a patient doesn't want a healthcare worker to share confidential health information, they need to make this clear and discuss the matter with healthcare staff. Patients have the right, in most situations, to refuse permission for a health care professional to share their information with another healthcare professional, even one giving them care—but are advised, where appropriate, about the dangers of this course of action, due to possible drug interactions.

However, in a few limited instances, a healthcare worker can share personal information without consent if it is in the public interest. These instances are set out in guidance from the General Medical Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/confidentiality.asp|title=GMC - Confidentiality|work=gmc-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the regulatory body for doctors. Sometimes the healthcare worker has to provide the information - if required by law or in response to a court order.

The [[National AIDS Trust]] has written a guide for people living with HIV to confidentiality in the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;http://nat.org.uk/media/Files/Publications/Confidentiality-July-2014_FINAL-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical and counseling psychology==
The ethical principle of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a [[therapist]] in the course of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the [[therapeutic alliance]], as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician's [[duty to warn]] or [[duty to protect]]. This includes instances of [[suicidal behavior]] or [[homicidal]] plans, [[child abuse]], [[elder abuse]] and [[dependent adult abuse]].  Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} confidentiality laws have been changed{{by whom|date=October 2015}} so that doctors and nurses face strict penalties if they breach confidentiality.

On 26 June 2012 a judge of [[Oslo District Court]] apologized for the court's hearing of testimony (on 14 June, regarding contact with [[Child Welfare Services (Norway)]]) that was covered by confidentiality (that had not been waived at that point of the [[trial of Anders Behring Breivik]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/22juli/Tingretten-ber-Behring-Breiviks-mor-om-unnskyldning-6912500.html|title= Tingretten ber Behring Breiviks mor om unnskyldning|author= Per Anders Johansen|work= Aftenposten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial confidentiality ==
Some legal jurisdictions recognise a category of commercial confidentiality whereby a [[business]] may withhold information on the basis of perceived harm to "[[commercial interest]]s".&lt;ref&gt;

Confidentiality agreements that "seal" [[Settlement (litigation)|litigation settlements]] are not uncommon, but this can leave regulators and society ignorant of public hazards. In the U.S. state of Washington, for example, journalists discovered that about two dozen medical malpractice cases had been improperly sealed by judges, leading to improperly weak discipline by the state Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/what-the-state-didnt-know-about-doctor-malpractice-suit/|title=What the state didn't know about doctor, malpractice suit|date=2006-12-13|website=The Seattle Times|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s and early 2000s, the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic sexual abuse scandal]] involved a number of confidentiality agreements with victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/27/nyregion/albany-diocese-settled-abuse-case-for-almost-1-million.html|title=Albany Diocese Settled Abuse Case for Almost $1 Million|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=2002-06-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have passed laws that limit confidentiality.

In the [[social science]]s, '''coordinated management of meaning''' ('''CMM''') provides understanding of how individuals create, coordinate and manage meanings in their process of communication. Generally, it refers to "how individuals establish rules for creating and interpreting meaning and how those rules are enmeshed in a conversation where meaning is constantly being coordinated".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory Analysis and Application (3rd Edition)|last = West|first = Richard|publisher = McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year = |isbn = 978-0-07-313561-8|location = |pages = 111|last2 = Turner|first2 = Lynn H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People live in a world where there is constant communication. In communicating with others, people assign meanings in their messages based on past [[conversation]]al experiences from previous social realities. Through communication, an underlying process takes place in which individuals negotiate a common or conflicted meanings of the world around them, thereby creating a new social reality. CMM advocates that meanings can be managed in a productive way so as to improve the state of interactions by coordinating and managing the [[meaning-making]] process.

CMM  relies on three interdependent elements: coordination, management and meaning. These elements help to explain how social realities are created through conversation.

== History and orientation ==
The theory of CMM was developed in the mid-1970s by W. Barnett Pearce (1943 - 2011) and Vernon E. Cronen. Communication Action and Meaning was devoted to CMM, is thorough explication of CMM, which Pearce and Cronen introduced to the common scholarly vernacular of the discipline. Their scholarly collaboration at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts at Amherst]] offered a major contribution to the philosophy of communication as story-centered, applicable, and ever attentive to the importance of human meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronald C|first=Arnett|year=2013|title=Philosophy Of Communication As Carrier Of Meaning: Adieu To W. Barnett Pearce|url=|journal=Qualitative Research Reports In|volume=14.1|pages=1–9|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster of ideas in which CMM emerged has moved from the periphery toward greater acceptance and CMM has continued to evolve along a trajectory from an interpretive [[social science]] to one with a critical edge and then to what its founders call a "practical theory".

Aware that the intellectual footing for communication theory had shifted, the first phase of the CMM project involved developing concepts that met the twin criteria of (1) adequately expressing the richness of human communication and (2) guiding empirical investigation. Pearce describes the creation of CMM through the following story:&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|align=center|...I think that I am the first person ever to use the awkward phrase "coordinated management of meaning".  Of course, tones of voice are often more informative than the verbal content of what is said, and struggle and frustration were expressed in the tones of voice in which "CMM" was first said. For years, I had been trying to bring together what I was learning from social science research, rhetorical studies, philosophy, theology, and, in my father's term, the "School of Hard Knocks". I felt that most of the models of communication that I knew were useful but that all were limited and limiting in some important ways, and that I had to invent something that was better.

Communication is about ''meaning'',... but not just in a passive sense of perceiving messages. Rather, we live in lives filled with meanings and one of our life challenges is to ''manage'' those meanings so that we can make our social worlds coherent and live within them with honor and respect. But this process of managing our meanings is never done in isolation. We are always and necessarily ''coordinating'' the way we manage our meanings with other people. So, I concluded, communication is about the coordinated management of meaning.|''W. Barnett Pearce''}}

CMM is one of an increasing number of theories that see communication as "[[performative]]" (doing things, not just talking "about" them) and "constitutive" (the material substance of the social world, not just a means of transmitting information within it). In CMM-speak, "taking the communication perspective" means looking at communication rather than through it, and seeing communication as the means by which we make the objects and events of our social worlds.

The "communication perspective" entails a shift in focus from [[theory]] to [[wikt:praxis|praxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronen 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM concepts and models are best understood as providing tools for naming aspects of performance. To date, CMM has found greater acceptance among practitioners than among scholars. Taking the communication perspective confers something like "communication literacy"—the ability to inscribe and read the complex process of communication in real time. Among other things, CMM's concepts and models guide practitioners in helping clients become aware of the patterns of communication which make up aspects of the social world. They want to change and help both clients and practitioners identify openings or "[[bifurcation point]]s" in everyday lives. Many CMM practitioners have an explicit commitment not only to describe and understand, but to improve the conditions in which they and those around them live. They believe that the best way of making better social worlds is to improve the patterns of communication which generates them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics==
It has been said that "CMM theory is a kind of [[multi-tool]] (like a '[[Swiss army knife]]') that is useful in any situation".&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a single theory, but rather a collection of ideas to understand how humans interact during communication. According to CMM, individuals construct their own social realities while engaged in conversation. To put it simply, communicators apply rules in order to understand what is going on during their social interaction. Based on the situation, different rules are applied in order to produce "better" patterns of communication.&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12"&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

CMM theory is a fairly complex study focusing on both the complexity in the micro-social processes and the aspects of daily interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren 2004, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it is concerned with how we coordinate and establish meaning during interactions. The theory can be complicated to teach and/or present to others, but it is best understood when it is broken down into the basics. The theory consists of three key concepts, which are further broken down into several different building blocks.

The fundamental building blocks of CMM theory focus specifically on the flow of communication between people. The three different concepts experienced either [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]], are coordination, management and meaning.

===1. Coordination.===
Coordination refers to "the degree to which persons perceive that their actions have fitted together into some mutually intelligible sequence or pattern of actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Watershed research traditions in human communication theory|last = Gerry|first = Phillipsen|publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists "when two people attempt to make sense out of the sequencing of messages in their conversation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is, if people in the interaction can recognize what their partners are talking about, then we say the conversation come to a coordination. Scientists believes that people's desire for coordination in interaction arises from the subjectivity of meaning, which means the same message may have different meanings to different people. In order to avoid this pitfall in communication, people work together to share meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessing belief in coordinating meaning in romantic relationships|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that [[Sensemaking|sense making]] is the foundation of coordination. By tokens within the information connected by means of channel can the logic relationship emerges, then it contributes to the sense making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Progressive Ontology Alignment for Meaning Coordination: An Information-theoretic Foundation|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1082473.1082586|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the Fourth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems|date = 2005-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-59593-093-0|pages = 737–744|series = AAMAS '05|doi = 10.1145/1082473.1082586|first = Marco|last = Schorlemmer|first2 = Yannis|last2 = Kalfoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense making helps people to establish common understanding then further develops coordination between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Common understanding as a basis for coordination|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/13563280810869587|journal = Corporate Communications: An International Journal|date = 2008-05-09|issn = 1356-3289|pages = 147–167|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1108/13563280810869587 | last1 = Jaatinen | first1 = Miia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of coordination has to do with the fact that our actions do not stand alone with regard to communication. The words or actions that we use during a conversation come together to produce patterns. These patterns, also known as stories lived, influence the behavior used during each interaction as a way to collaborate. Pearce and Cronen are quick to point out that coordination does not imply a commitment to coordinate "smoothly", but rather the concept is meant to provide the basis for being mindful of the other side of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three possible outcome of coordination:

1. People in the interaction achieve coordination.

2. People in the interaction failed to achieve coordination.

3. People in the interaction achieve some degree of coordination.

If the interaction fail to achieve coordination or achieve partially coordination, the possible solution is to move the level of meaning to another level.

===2. Management===
Our interactions are guided and defined by rules. "Interactants must understand the social reality and then incorporate rules as they decide how to act in a given situation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the use of rules, individuals manage and coordinate meanings in the conversation. "Once rules are established in a [[dialogue]], interactants will have a sufficiently common symbolic framework for communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An approach to communication theory: Toward consensus on rules|date = 1972|journal = Journal of Communication|doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1972.tb00149.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume=22 |pages=217–238 | last1 = Cushman | first1 = Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it would be ambiguous if a friend says "I hate you". Does the friend really hate whomever he/she is speaking to or he/she is just expressing his/her feelings at the moment? Rules will help clarify and explain this kind of meanings.
* '''Constitutive rules''': refer to "how behavior should be interpreted within a given context".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It tells us what the given behavior means and linking belief to one another and behaviors to beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerald W|first=Driskill|year=1995|title=Managing Cultural Differences: A Rules Analysis In A Bicultural Organization|url=|journal=Howard Journal of Communications|volume=5.4|pages=353–379|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example above, "I hate you" in some contexts counts as an expression of slight dissatisfaction. 
* '''Regulative rules''': refer to "some sequence of action that an individual undertakes, and they communicate what happens next in a conversation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they are also referred as "cognitive reorganizations of constitutive rules" &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other word, it means the behavior that is requested in certain situation. Regulative rules link the meanings in the interaction with the consequences they result to. Our body reaction can reflect on the contents of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Keep meaning in conversational coordination|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397/abstract|journal = Cognitive Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4253663|pmid = 25520693|pages = 1397|volume = 5|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01397|first = Elena C.|last = Cuffari}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"Unwanted repetitive patterns":''' It refers to "the sequential and recurring conflictual episodes that are considered unwanted by the individuals in the conflict."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This phenomenon happens because "two people with particular rule systems follow a structure that obligates them to perform specific behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several reasons count for unwanted repetitive patterns. First, sometimes people can't find other options than being in conflict. Second, people may feel comfortable in the conflict situation because they have experience on what others will behave in this kind of situation. Third, people may be tired of finding resolution on the conflict situation.
* '''"Not everything within communication can be explained."''', which is called Mystery. It is the recognition that "the world and our experience of it is more than any of the particular stories that make it coherent or any of the activities in which we engage".&lt;ref name="Pearce Associates 1999, p.12" /&gt; Mystery has to do with the sense of awe or wonder when communication leads to a surprising outcome. Put more simply, it is the feeling (anything from attraction to hate) one experiences when engaged in conversation that cannot be linked to the situation as a whole.

CMM theory sees each conversation as a complex interconnected series of events in which each individual affects and is affected by the other. Although the primary emphasis of CMM theory has to do with the concept of first person communication, known as a [[participatory]] view, once the concepts are understood they are more readily visible during other interactions. Furthermore, this knowledge can be applied to similar situations which will in turn lead to more effective communication.

=== 3. Meaning ===
Coordinated management of meaning states that people "organize meaning in a [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] manner." Theorists on CMM was in agreement on two points regarding hierarchical meaning. "First, the hierarchical of meaning defines the context in which regulative and constitutive rules are to be understood. Second, these contexts are arranged in a hierarchical af abstractness, such that higher levels of the hierarchy help to define – and may subsume – lower level."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication Theories, Perspectives, Processes, and contexts|publisher = |year = |isbn = 0-07-293794-7|location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can interpreted  to each of the contexts in the "hierarchical can be understood by looking at the other contexts, and each contexts is always contextualizing other contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eerika|first=Hedman|last2=Gesch-Karamanlidis|first2=Eleni|date=|year=2015|title=Facilitating Conversations That Matter Using Coordinated Management Of Meaning Theory|url=|journal=OD Practitioner|volume=47.2|pages=|via=1. Business Source Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six levels of meaning. ''Levels below are illustrated from lower level to higher level.''

====(1) Content====
The content or [[message]] according to CMM theory relates to the raw data and information spoken aloud during communication.To put it simply, content is the words used to communicate. The content is essentially the basic building blocks of any [[language]]; however, it is important to note that the content by itself is not sufficient to establish the meaning of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;HFCL Tutorial 2008, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====(2) Speech act====
Another integral part of the CMM theory includes the [[speech act]].  "Speech acts communicate the intention of the speaker and indicate how a particular communication should be taken."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The simplest explanation of a speech act is "actions that you perform by speaking. They include compliments, insults, promises, [[wikt:threat|threats]], assertions, and questions".&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 1994, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; CMM theory draws upon the [[speech act theory]], which further breaks down speech acts into separate categories of sounds or utterances. Though the speech act theory is much more detailed, it is important to have an understanding of both [[illocutionary]] and [[perlocutionary]] utterances.

* An ''illocutionary utterance'' is speech that intends to make contact with a receiver.
* A ''perlocutionary utterance'' includes speech that intends to alter the behavior of the receiver.

There are many different utterances or speech acts including questions, answers, commands, promises and statements. Having knowledge of each of these plays a large part in an individual being able to participate in a communications exchange.

====(3) Episodes====
An episode is a situation created by persons in a conversation. The same content can take on different meaning when the situation is different. For example, a phrase used among close family or friends may take on an entirely different meaning in a job interview. In the interactions, people may punctuate differently on a same episode. This will result to people deal with the differences on their punctuations on subsequent episodes. Especially when people situated the bi-cultural or multi-cultural situation has identified a number of specific acts which occurred in an equivalent situation in the other culture, would have totally disrupted the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Wolfson|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|year=1983|title=A Cross-Cultural Comparison Of The Implications Of Self-Disclosure On Conversational Logics|url=|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=31.3|pages=249–256|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.|doi=10.1080/01463378309369511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====(4) Relationship====
Relationship is the higher level of the meaning, where "relational boundaries in that parameters are established for attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This building block is fairly easy to understand as it is the dynamic of what connects two (or more) individuals during an exchange of information. Examples of a [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] could be defined as a parent/child, teacher/student, strangers, etc. Communication between strangers would likely be different from conversations amongst family members.

====(5) Life scripts====

Life scripts can be understood as the patterns of episodes. On this level, "every individual's history of relationships and interactions will influence rules and interaction patterns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Life scripts are similar to the [[autobiography]] of individuals. It comprises the person's exceptions for variety communicative events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron E|first=Cronen|last2=Pearce|first2=W. Barnett|last3=Harris|first3=Linda M|year=1979|title=The Logic Of The Coordinated Management Of Meaning: A Rules-Based Approach To The First Course In Interpersonal Communication.|url=|journal=Communication Education|volume=28.1|pages=22–38|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several CMM texts describe this building block as a "script for who we are" as the role an individual plays in the movie of life. For example, an individual may believe they are funny, and therefore may act according to that perspective while engaged in different conversations.

====(6) Cultural patterns====
The concept of culture in CMM theory relates to a set of rules for acting and speaking which govern what we understand to be normal in a given episode. There are different rules for [[social interaction]] depending on the culture. To some extent, during communication individuals act in accordance with their cultural values. While we often don't even realize that culture impacts communication during day to day interactions, people must learn to be compatible with individuals from different cultures in order to have effective communication.

==Models and applications==
Pearce is adamant that CMM is not just an interpretive theory but is meant to be a practical theory as well.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive literature involving the use of CMM to address [[family violence]], intra-community relations, [[workplace conflict]] and many other [[social issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, et al. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sundarajan and Spano 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce and Pearce 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A research employs CMM to understand the "perceived acts of discrimination manifested within the context of everyday interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defining discrimination across cultural groups: Exploring the [un-]coordinated management of meaning|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147176710000088|journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date = 2010-05-01|pages = 283–293|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004|first = Mark P.|last = Orbe|first2 = Sakile K.|last2 = Camara}}&lt;/ref&gt; By applying CMM into research, the researchers are able to explicate the rules of meaning-making that majority and minority groups followed in understanding the discrimination act. Another application example was done in 1994 when CMM was initially recognized by people. It believes that the framework of CMM provides an understanding of "the structure and process of consumer decision making by placing those decisions within the context of a family's social reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Co‐ordinated Management of Meaning: A Case Exemplar of a New Consumer Research Technologynull|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090569410067640|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = 1994-08-01|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 76–99|volume = 28|issue = 8/9|doi = 10.1108/03090569410067640 | last1 = Buttle | first1 = Francis A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along this line, CMM theorists have used or developed several [[analysis]] [[scientific modelling|models]] to help understand and improve communication. The models addressed here are the hierarchy model, the serpentine model, charmed and strange loops. Examples for the first model have been adapted from ones Pearce uses in one of his writings where he analyzes the courtroom conversation between [[Ramzi Yousef]], the individual convicted of bombing the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 1994, and Kevin T. Duffy, the [[federal judge]] who presided over his trial. In Yousef's statement before sentencing, he criticizes the US for its hypocrisy; he accuses the US of being the premier [[terrorist]], and reasserts his pride in his fight against the US. At the sentencing, Duffy accuses Yousef of being a virus, evil, perverting the principles of [[Islam]], and interested only in death. Neither individual really talks to the other, but rather at them.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.38-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1. Hierarchy model===
The hierarchy model is the hierarchy of organized meanings as illustrated in the "[[#3. Meaning|Meaning]]" section. The hierarchy model is a tool for an individual to explore the perspectives of their conversational partners while also enabling them to take a more thorough look at their own personal [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. The elements at the top of each list form the overall context in which each story takes place and have an influence on the elements below them. The levels of meaning from lowest to highest are: content, speech act, episodes, relationship, life scripts, and cultural patterns.

Stephen W. Littlejohn and Karen A. Foss in their book ''Theories of Human Communication'' (Tenth Edition)&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W., and Karen A. Foss. "Chapter 6: The Conversation." Theories of Human Communication. Long Grove, IL: Waveland, 2017. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a type of logical force called contextual force. Contextual force causes a person to follow a form of logic that leads one to believe that an action or interpretation is a direct result of, and is appropriate to, the context. For example, "How else could I have reacted?" or "Naturally I acted that way, it was appropriate to the situation," leads to the mentality of "I did what I had to do." Secondly, in CMM contexts are extremely important and they are not static and unchanging. For example, a relationship that is longstanding can contextualize the episode of an ugly argument as something unpleasant, but unavoidable. The couple will most likely worth though this ugly argument because of their relationship contextualizing the episode. However, an episode of an ugly argument can contextualize a relationship if a couple is on their first date. Therefore the argument is more likely to contextualize the relationship is over or not worth pursuing. What contextualizes what in the hierarchy of organized meanings overlaps and is interlinked in a complicated hierarchy of meanings which can shift at any moment.

===2. Serpentine model===
The CMM theorists take the hierarchy model a step further by reinforcing the importance of interaction and adding the aspect of time. Pearce stresses that communication cannot be done alone and that furthermore this usually occurs before or after another's actions. Therefore, understanding past events and their impact on individuals is essential to improving communication. This new model is called the serpentine model and visually demonstrates how communication is a back and forth interaction between participants rather than just a simple transmission of information.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce 2005, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. Charmed and strange loop===
The embedded contexts illustrated in the hierarchy model represent a stable [[hierarchy]]. It suggests that higher levels subsume lower levels. Meanwhile, sometimes "lower levels can reflect back and affect the meaning of higher levels."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is termed "loop". CMM believes that there is a stronger "contextual effect", which works from higher levels to the lower levels, and a weaker "implicative effect", which works the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tortured Families: A Coordinated Management of Meaning Analysis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x/abstract|journal = Family Process|date = 2004-09-01|issn = 1545-5300|pages = 349–371|volume = 43|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2004.00027.x|first = Edith|last = Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt; When loops are consistent with the hierarchy, it is identified as a "charmed loop".  In this kind of interaction, each person's perceptions and actions help to reinforce the other's perceptions and actions.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2004, p.9"&gt;Kearney 2004, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower levels are inconsistent with the higher levels, it is called a "strange loop". Essentially, "a 'strange' loop is a repetitive interactional pattern that alternates between [[contradictory]] meanings".&lt;ref&gt;Craig 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the alcoholic identifies that he is an alcoholic and then quits drinking. Since he has quit drinking, he convinces himself that he is not really an alcoholic and so he starts drinking again, which makes him an alcoholic. He alternates between contradictory [[perceptions]] of being an alcoholic and not being an alcoholic. The charmed and strange loop model also has its applications. In a research regarding the social construction of male college student logical forces, the charmed and strange loop model was utilized in studying male college students' narratives in describing their memorable sexual experiences.

Less commonly, there is a third variation called "subversive" loop. Texts and contexts within a subversive loop are mutually invalidating and can prevent coherence and coordination. It may result in intentionally outrageous behavior, efforts to act in uninterruptible ways, or refusal to recognize the possibility that the outsider can understand the situation of the insider.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce Associates 1999, p.37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 4. Applications ===
CMM theory is regarding as kind of multi-tool by providing a framework to structure different themes. In this regard, there are lots of qualitative study using CMM to illustrate its utility for framing their findings. Because people interpret messages and know the rules or guide which can follow and have actions constitute appropriate responses. Now, its focus on cultural influence to get insights into how individuals negotiate complex messages occurring at different levels of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozhdeh B|first=Truss|year=2005|title=Food, Culture, And Family: Exploring The Coordinated Management Of Meaning Regarding Childhood Obesity|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=18.2|pages=155–175|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since CMM attempts to explain the process by group member to make sense out of the regular path of messages and carried out into a group conversation. So according to CMM, individual perspective with group approach conversation need to combine and create a better meaning-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Moore|last2=Laters|first2=Amy|year=2008|title=Coordinated Management Of Meaning In Chat Rooms|url=|journal=International Communication Association|volume=|pages=1–46|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Qualitative experiment framework tool  
* Online chat room user experience by applying CMM theory, conduct a textual analysis.
* Data analysis tool though on how people use complex, multilevel systems of reference to derive meaning and guide behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark P|first=Orbe|last2=Camara|first2=Skile K|year=2012|title=Defining Discrimination Across Cultural Groups: Exploring The [Un-]Coordinated Management Of Meaning.|url=|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=34.3|pages=283–293|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory criticism==
In order to provide criticism of the CMM theory, it is important to establish a baseline for what accounts for a "good" study. Many scholars use different criteria for determining what makes a theory relevant, but they most often surround the following six concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2001, p.4-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1: Theories should be evaluated on their ability to produce [[hypotheses]] that are consistent with relevant evidence. CMM theory falls short under the criteria of rule 1 as it does not set out to provide measureable hypotheses that can be compared to any other situation. While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different. 
* 2: General theories are preferred to less general theories. From the perspective of this rule, CMM theory is very general; however it is also very vague. The theory has difficulty focusing on exactly what is important in each interaction thereby not allowing those who study the theory to understand what is considered critical in a communicative interaction. 
* 3: Theories that produce several hypotheses are preferred to those that produce few. From this perspective, CMM theory fails as it neglects to have even a single hypothesis that is testable.
* 4: It is more beneficial to evaluate research programs rather than individual theories. As CMM theory focuses on levels of contact between two (or more) persons engaged in communication, these findings from CMM research contribute beyond mere observation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danielle|first=Wiese|last2=Farrugia|first2=Rebekah|year=2009|title=Coordinating Communication On Facebook: An Analysis Of Meaning Development Through Close Relationships|url=|journal=Conference Papers -- National Communication Association|volume=|pages=|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is unsuccessful as a way to evaluate anything other than individual interactions.
* 5: The overall implications of a theory mean that those with several are preferred over those with few. CMM theory focuses on how we create our social environments in the present, however it fails to predict how the theory can affect future events. 
* 6: Simplicity is considered a virtue. In accordance with this rule, CMM theory falls short. CMM is an extremely broad theory with many different terms, views and loopholes which makes a multifaceted study of communication even more complex
CMM has been criticized for too broad in its scope and highly abstract in its nature. "Poole wrote 'It is difficult ... to paint with broad strokes and at the same time give difficult areas the attention they deserve'.".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1987, Brenders also stated that "in its broad - stroked approach to human interaction, CMM has missed many of the linguistic, international, and theoretical nuances necessary for an understanding of communicative meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fallacies in the coordinated management of meaning: A philosophy of language critique of the hierarchical organization of coherent conversation and related theory.|date = 1987|journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech|doi = 10.1080/00335638709383812|pmid = |access-date = |volume=73 |pages=329–348 | last1 = Brenders | first1 = David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also criticized for its conceptual apparatus as "incomplete with regard to a full examination of the material layering of practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Proposal for Integrating Structuration Theory With Coordinated Management of Meaning Theory|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510970600666867|journal = Communication Studies|date = 2006-07-01|issn = 1051-0974|pages = 173–196|volume = 57|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10510970600666867|first = Randall A.|last = Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a humanistic perspective, CMM theory is seen as valuable as it seeks to provide a way to clarify communication for better interaction and understanding. Its utility lies in "how people achieve meaning, their potential recurring conflicts, and the influence of the self on the communication process is admirable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It promotes [[reform]] by encouraging individuals to explain particular viewpoints in order to reach understanding.

The final point can be seen as both a criticism and positive [[critique]]. Pearce and Cronen are constantly building upon the CMM theory which was originally outlined in the 1970s. By constant corrections and revisions, the theorists are working toward improving the examination of communication interactions; however, with each new update, minor course corrections alter the terms and meanings which increase the complexity of the overall theory.

CMM has guided research in an array of context and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Barge 2004"&gt;Barge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Further discussion of CMM concepts and applications for research can be found at the following location: [http://www.pearceassociates.com/essays/research_menu.htm CMM Research]

== Mission ==
To use its institutions together to create a unique network that fosters scientific inquiry and discovery with regards to Earth's Critical Zone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much like the interconnectedness of Earth's critical zone systems, CZO relies upon a range of disciplines, including [[Geoscience|geosciences]], [[hydrology]], [[microbiology]], [[ecology]], [[soil science]], and [[engineering]], to develop a theoretical spatial-temporal framework for critical zone evolution for both quantifiable and conceptualized data analyses.

== Education and Outreach ==
Through research and education opportunities associated with each CZO, cross-CZO scientific endeavors, and annual meetings, CZO uses a variety of interfaces to communicate Critical Zone science to students and teachers.

=== National Office ===
In 2014, a National Office branch was formalized to facilitate communication and collaboration among researchers and students, support education and outreach initiatives, coordinate data protocols and common measurements, and to provide a single point of contact for the Critical Zone Observatories.

== Critical Zone Observatories Worldwide ==
According to [http://www.soiltrec.eu/CZOPages/wfieldSites.html SoilTrEC], there are 46 Critical Zone Observatories globally, with the majority in North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SoilTrEC - World Critical Zone Observatories|url = http://www.soiltrec.eu/CZOPages/wfieldSites.html|website = www.soiltrec.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 17 CZOs in Europe, 5 in Southeast Asia, 3 near Australia, 2 CZOs in Africa, and 2 in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banwart|first=Steven|last2=Menon|first2=Manoj|last3=Bernasconi|first3=Stefano M.|last4=Bloem|first4=Jaap|last5=Blum|first5=Winfried E.H.|last6=Souza|first6=Danielle Maia de|last7=Davidsdotir|first7=Brynhildur|last8=Duffy|first8=Christopher|last9=Lair|first9=Georg J.|title=Soil processes and functions across an international network of Critical Zone Observatories: Introduction to experimental methods and initial results|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1631071312001885|journal=Comptes Rendus Geoscience|volume=344|issue=11–12|pages=758–772|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2012.10.007|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

'''Fictional locations''' are places that exist only in [[fiction]] and not in reality, such as the [[Dark Kingdom|Negaverse]] or [[Planet X]]. Writers may create and describe such places to serve as backdrop for their fictional works. Fictional locations are also created for use as settings in [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''.  They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of [[Bookland]], which is used to allow [[European Article Number|EAN]] "country" codes 978 and 979 to be used for [[ISBN]] numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for [[ISSN]] numbers on magazines and other [[periodical]]s.

Fictional locations vary greatly in their size. Very small places like a single room are kept out of the umbrella of fictional locations by convention, as are most single buildings. A fictional location can be the size of a university ([[Howard Phillips Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Miskatonic University]]), a town ([[Stephen King]]'s [[Salem's Lot]]), a county ([[William Faulkner|William Faulkner's]] [[Yoknapatawpha County]]), a state ([[Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)|Winnemac]] in various [[Sinclair Lewis]] stories), a large section of continent (as in north-western [[Middle-earth]], which supposedly represents Europe), a whole planet ([[Anne McCaffrey]]'s [[Pern]]), a whole galaxy ([[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'']] books), even a [[multiverse]] (''[[His Dark Materials]]''). In a larger scale, occasionally the term [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] is used, but only if it is considered a variant of Earth rather than an original world. [[Austin Tappan Wright]]'s ''[[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]'' has an invented continent, Karain, on our world. However in [[fanfiction]], along with [[pastiche]] and/or [[parody]], it is not considered canon unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Locating a story==
Within narrative prose, providing a believable location can be greatly enhanced by the provision of maps and other illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mapping a fictional location | author=Elsa Neal | work= Fiction Writing Site | url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9382.asp | accessdate=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often considered particularly true for [[fantasy novel]]s and [[historical novel]]s which often make great use of the map, but applies equally to [[science fiction]] and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]]: earlier, in mainstream novels by [[Anthony Trollope]], [[William Faulkner]], etc. Fantasy and science fiction novels often also provide sections which provide documentation of various aspects of the environment of the fiction, including languages, character lists, cultures and, of course, locations.

In an online article on writing Dawn Arkin writes about the importance of location to the author's art:

{{quote|text=
Setting has become a very important part of most novels.

Creating a fictional location has many advantages for the writer. You get to name the town, streets, businesses, schools, etc. Everything inside your town is under your control.
|sign=Dawn Arkin
|source={{Citation |title=What Should Your Story's Setting Be? |publisher=[[EzineArticles]]&lt;!--black listed |url=http://ezinearticles.com/?What-Should-Your-Storys-Setting-Be?&amp;id=293268 --&gt; |date=7 September 2006}}}}

Maps are an immediate necessity for some works, as they do not take place on our Earth. Writers need working maps to keep straight at a glance whether the castle is north or south of the river, and how long it takes to get between valleys. This can be very helpful in preventing snags when dealing directly with fictional geography.

{{quote|text=
Authors are as forgetful and absent-minded as the lesser breeds of humankind, and a simple precaution like taking a moment to sketch out a map helps prevent such errors and inconsistencies (upon which eagle-eyed readers are bound to swoop with gleeful cries, thereafter sitting down to write nasty letters to the poor author).

|source={{Citation |chapter=Of World-Making: Some Problems of the Invented Milieu |title=[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |year=1973}}}}

Sometimes an actual geographic corner is used as a model for "getting it right", and identifying these can become a game for readers. Authors may turn an island into a continent or vice versa, rotate orientation, or combine two similar locales to get the best (for the story) of both.

The '''frog pond effect''' is the [[theory]] that individuals evaluate themselves as worse when in a group of higher performing individuals.

The frog pond effect is a part of the wider [[social comparison theory]].  It relates to how [[Self-evaluation motives|individuals evaluate themselves]] based on comparisons to other people around them, and is generally due to upward comparisons. Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=James|title=The Campus as a Frog Pond: An Application of the Theory of Relative Deprivation to Career Decisions of College Men|year=1966|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Volume%2092/Issue%206/Sander/Final%20Sourcelist%20Sourcepull/Sander.fn035.frogpond.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; first noticed this effect when he discovered that students evaluated their performance as worse based on their peers from their school. MacFarland and Buehler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1995|last1=MacFarland|first1=Cathy|last2=Beuhler|first2=Roger|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/68/6/1055.html|title=Collective Self-Esteem as a Moderator of the Frog-Pond Effect in Reactions to Performance Feedback}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the effect happens because individuals self-monitor within-group rather than compare across groups.  Individuals are affected by the frog pond effect the most when they come from an [[individualistic culture]], lack strong social connections, and have low collective [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;MacFarland and Beuhler, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kendo]] originated in Japan, but is today practiced worldwide.

The size and depth of kendo skill varies widely from country to country. Some countries have few kendo practitioners, while Japan has several million.

Generally, kendo has stronger traditions in countries with strong historical ties to Japan, like [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], as well as countries with large Japanese immigrant communities such as the United States, Canada and [[Brazil]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the term kendo is used all over the world, the term [[Kumdo]] is used in Korea.

==International Organisations==

The following international organisations administer, manage, promote, or have an interest in the development of [[kendo]].

*The [[International Kendo Federation]] (FIK) is the international federation of most national and regional kendo organisations. The FIK was established in 1970 to provide a link between the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]] and the developing international kendo community. Seventeen national or regional federations were the founding affiliates. The number of affiliated and recognised organisations has increased over the years to 57 (as of May 2015)2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kendo-fik.org/ International Kendo Federation (FIK)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:FIK affiliated national and regional kendo organisations are listed on the FIK [http://www.kendo-fik.org/english-page/english-page2/IKF-affiliates/IKF-affiliates.htm website].

:The FIK has conducted the [[World Kendo Championship]]s, every three years since it was established. The international competition is contested by individual and team representatives of the FIK affiliates.

*[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]] (DNBK) was established in [[Kyoto]], Japan, in 1953, .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnbk.org/history.cfm Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK)]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the new axiom of DNBK stresses preservation of classical martial arts tradition and the promotion of education and community service through martial arts training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnbk.org/history.cfm Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (DNBK) History]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[International Martial Arts Federation]] (IMAF) was established in Kyoto, Japan, in 1952. Among the objectives of IMAF are the expansion of interest in Japanese martial arts, the establishment of communication, friendship, understanding and harmony among member chapters, the development of the minds and bodies of members, and the promotion of global understanding and personal growth.
*[[Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei]] (ZNSBR) The organization known as the Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei (All Japan [Comprehensive] Budō Federation or SōBuRen) has as its mission the preservation of all Japanese martial arts. This includes (pre-Meiji) Nihon koryū bujutsu/bugei and (post-Meiji) gendai budō. We operate under the protection of the Japanese Imperial House as an entity that protects Japanese culture. The organization was created by Suzuki Masafumi-kanchō in 1969. After the passing of its founder, Ishikawa Takashi-kanchō, Toyama-ryū iaidō hanshi 9th dan and jūkendo hanshi 9th dan, replaced him as President of the Zen Nihon Sōgō-Budō Renmei.

==National and Regional Organisations==
Many national and regional organisations manage and promote [[kendo]], some are affiliated to international kendo organisations, while other organisations are independent of international kendo organisations.

===Africa===
*[[South Africa]] The [http://www.sakf.co.za/ South Africa Kendo Federation]. The SAKF and [[Tunisia]] The [http://www.tun-kf.org/ Tunisian Kendo League]. The TKL are the only two federations recognized by The International Kendo Federation (FIK) in Africa, but there is also kendo activity in [[Mozambique]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Malawi]].

Kendo was introduced to [[Malawi]] in 1992 when a Japanese volunteer took on a group of local children as his students. The [https://www.facebook.com/KendoAssociationOfMalawi Kendo Association of Malawi] was formed in 1999 and has seen significant growth in recent years. The Kendo Association of [[Malawi]] works closely with the Embassy of Japan in Malawi to promote kendo as a sport and to encourage cultural exchange and interaction between the peoples of the two nations. The majority of the Kendo Associations activities take place in [[Blantyre]] and [[Lilongwe]], with some activity in [[Mzuzu]]. The Association holds regular weekly practice sessions in each city, and holds at least two local tournaments each year which are patronized by all manner of people including Embassy officials and Japanese expatriates and their families.

The major challenge that the Kendo Association of [[Malawi]] faces is that of resources, as kendo equipment tends to be expensive, and funding is often difficult to secure. However, the Embassy of Japan and well wishers have been a great help in this regard, donating all manner of equipment and resource.

Although there is a great interest in tournaments of all levels, a challenge that continues to face kendo players in [[Malawi]] is a lack of opportunity to compete at a regional and international level. This hinders the progress and development of players and stunts the growth of the sport. It is currently not possible to test for [[Dan rank]] within [[Malawi]], and as of March 2014 there are less than 10 Malawians who have obtained [[Dan rank]] in kendo.

===Europe===
The [[European Kendo Federation]] (EKF) is member of [[International Kendo Federation]] (FIK), which 35 countries/regions belong to, also promotes jodo and iaido.  European kendo championships have been held since 1974. Championships are held every year that there is no world championship. Some national organisations are affiliated to EKF, while other organisations are independent of EKF.

===South America===
In South America, the practice of Kendo has existed since the arrival of Japanese immigrants as early as 1908.  Since then and with Brazil as its centre, kendo has spread over South America. Now kendo practitioners and kendo federations exist in many countries in South America such as: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, Aruba and Chile.

At the December 2006 meeting of the International Kendo Federation (FIK) held in Taiwan, the South American Kendo Confederation (CSK) was discussed and voted upon, as a result the Confederation was admitted as an FIK affiliate.

Argentina, Aruba, Chile, Brazil and Venezuela are affiliated with the FIK. The next South American Kendo championships will be held in Mexico during 2011.

'''Gladvertising''' (n) is [[outdoor advertising]] that uses cameras and [[facial recognition software]] to read a consumer's [[mood (psychology)|mood]], then pushes products relevant to the target [[emotional state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keats, Jonathan|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/06/st_jw_gladvertising/|title=Jargon Watch|work=Wired Magazine|date=July 2011|page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[emotion recognition]] software to tailor outdoor adverts to consumers' mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jazarah.net/the-real-minority-report-gladvertising-kick-starts-revolution-in-outdoor-advertising/|title=The real Minority Report: "Gladvertising" kick starts revolution in outdoor advertising|work=jazarah.net|date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms was coined in a July 2011 report by the Centre of Future Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | title=Up Front and Personal Digital Out-Of-Home Communications | publisher=Centre of Future Studies | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409070651/http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | archivedate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.futurestudies.co.uk/home.htm|title=Futurist Think Tank &amp; Strategic Futures Consultants: The centre for future studies|publisher=futurestudies.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that advertisements like the ones in the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' may be well on the way, and indeed, that some already exist. Their report – commissioned by 3MGTG, which specialises in digital advertising – foresees the first step to be advertisements that adapt to our moods.

'''Hepatotoxicity''' (from ''hepatic toxicity'') implies chemical-driven [[liver]] damage. '''Drug-induced liver injury''' is a cause of acute and chronic liver disease.

The liver plays a central role in transforming and clearing chemicals and is susceptible to the toxicity from these agents. Certain medicinal agents, when taken in overdoses and sometimes even when introduced within [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic ranges]], may injure the organ. Other chemical agents, such as those used in laboratories and industries, natural chemicals (e.g., [[microcystin]]s) and [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] can also induce hepatotoxicity. Chemicals that cause liver injury are called [[hepatotoxin]]s.

More than 900 drugs have been implicated in causing liver injury&lt;ref name="isbn0-8385-1551-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Friedman, Scott E. |author2=Grendell, James H. |author3=McQuaid, Kenneth R. |title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment in gastroenterology |publisher=Lang Medical Books/McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=664–679 |isbn=0-8385-1551-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see LiverTox, external link, below) and it is the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for drug screening assays, such as [[stem cell]]-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process.&lt;ref name="stem2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhough S, Hay DC |title=Stem Cell-Based Toxicity Screening: Recent Advances in Hepatocyte Generation |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=85–89 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/BF03256896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals often cause [[subclinical]] injury to the liver, which manifests only as abnormal [[Liver function tests|liver enzyme tests]].

Drug-induced liver injury is responsible for 5% of all hospital admissions and 50% of all [[acute liver failure]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn1-56053-618-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=McNally, Peter F. |title=GI/Liver Secrets: with STUDENT CONSULT Access |publisher=C.V.

== Cause ==
[[Image:Drug-induced hepatitis low mag.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Drug-induced hepatitis with [[granulomata]]. Other causes were excluded with extensive investigations. [[Liver]] [[biopsy]]. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s are classified as type A (intrinsic or pharmacological) or type B (idiosyncratic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davies, D. |title=Textbook of adverse drug reactions |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1985 |pages= 18–45|isbn=0-19-261479-7 |oclc=12558288 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A drug reaction accounts for 80% of all toxicities.&lt;ref name="pmid9554902"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pirmohamed M, Breckenridge AM, Kitteringham NR, Park BK |title=Adverse drug reactions |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7140 |pages=1295–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9554902 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.316.7140.1295|pmc=1113033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drugs]] or toxins that have a pharmacological (type A) hepatotoxicity are those that have ''predictable'' [[dose-response curve]]s (higher concentrations cause more liver damage) and well characterized mechanisms of toxicity, such as directly damaging liver tissue or blocking a metabolic process. As in the case of [[acetaminophen]] overdose, this type of injury occurs shortly after some threshold for toxicity is reached.

[[Idiosyncratic drug reaction|Idiosyncratic]] (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause ''non-predictable'' hepatotoxicity in susceptible individuals, which is not related to dose and has a variable latency period.&lt;ref name="pmid352664"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zimmerman HJ |title=Drug-induced liver disease |journal=Drugs |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=25–45 |year=1978 |pmid=352664|doi=10.2165/00003495-197816010-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; [[Troglitazone]] (Rezulin) and [[trovafloxacin]] (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.

Oral use of ketoconazole has been associated with hepatic toxicity, including some fatalities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketoconazole Tablets|url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/ketoconazole-tablets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, such effects appear to be limited to doses taken over a period longer than 7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banankhah|first=Peymaan S.|last2=Garnick|first2=Kyle A.|last3=Greenblatt|first3=David J.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ketoconazole-Associated Liver Injury in Drug-Drug Interaction Studies in Healthy Volunteers|journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|doi=10.1002/jcph.711|issn=1552-4604|pmid=26829173|volume=56|pages=1196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acetaminophen (Paracetamol)===
{{Main article|Acetaminophen toxicity}}

[[Image:Paracetamol-rod-povray.png|thumb|Acetaminophen (3D structure) overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease]]
[[Acetaminophen]] (in the US and Japan), paracetamol (INN), also known by the brand name Tylenol and Panadol, is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease and [[acute liver failure]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-443-06633-7"/&gt;  Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver.&lt;ref name="pmid15345657"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wallace JL |title=Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: NO to the rescue |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |year=2004 |pmid=15345657 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0705781 |pmc=1575258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with [[glutathione]] in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage.   [[Nitric oxide]] also plays a role in inducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=James LP, Mayeux PR, Hinson JA |title=Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Drug Metab. Dispos. |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1499–506 |year=2003 |pmid=14625346 |doi=10.1124/dmd.31.12.1499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics.&lt;ref name="pmid12006215"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Riordan SM, Williams R |title=Alcohol exposure and paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity |journal=Addict Biol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=191–206 |year=2002 |pmid=12006215 |doi=10.1080/13556210220120424 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prescott |first1=Laurie F. |title=Paracetamol, alcohol and the liver |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=291–301 |year=2000 |pmid=10759684 |pmc=2014937 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00167.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of [[Acetylcysteine]], a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop [[acute liver failure]] can still recover spontaneously,  but may require transplantation if poor [[prognostic]] signs such as [[encephalopathy]] or [[coagulopathy]] is present (see [[King's College Criteria]]).

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===
Although individual analgesics rarely induce liver damage due to their widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manov I, Motanis H, Frumin I, Iancu TC |title=Hepatotoxicity of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs: ultrastructural aspects |journal=Acta Pharmacol. Sin. |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=259–72 |year=2006 |pmid=16490160|doi=10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00278.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin and [[phenylbutazone]] are associated with intrinsic hepatotoxicity; idiosyncratic reaction has been associated with ibuprofen, sulindac,  phenylbutazone, piroxicam, diclofenac and indomethacin.

=== Glucocorticoids ===
Glucocorticoids are so named due to their effect on the carbohydrate mechanism. They promote glycogen storage in the liver. An enlarged liver is a rare side-effect of long-term steroid use in children.&lt;ref name="pmid3944744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iancu TC, Shiloh H, Dembo L |title=Hepatomegaly following short-term high-dose steroid therapy |journal=J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=41–6 |year=1986 |pmid=3944744 |doi=10.1097/00005176-198601000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and [[paediatric]] population is [[steatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isoniazid ===
Isoniazide (INH) is one of the most commonly used drugs for tuberculosis; it is associated with mild elevation of liver enzymes in up to 20% of patients and severe hepatotoxicity in 1-2% of patients.&lt;ref name="pmid10215642"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarich TC, Adams SP, Petricca G, Wright JM |title=Inhibition of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity in rabbits by pretreatment with an amidase inhibitor |journal=J.

Drugs continue to be taken off the market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the liver is susceptible to injury from drugs and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and then spleen via [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]]s that bring drugs and xenobiotics in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.
Many chemicals damage  [[mitochondria]], an intracellular organelle that produces energy. Its dysfunction releases excessive amount of oxidants that, in turn, injure hepatic cells. Activation of some enzymes in the cytochrome P-450 system such as  [[CYP2E1]] also lead to oxidative stress.&lt;ref name="pmid11812920"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeschke H, Gores GJ, Cederbaum AI, Hinson JA, Pessayre D, Lemasters JJ |title=Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity |journal=Toxicol.

=== Drug metabolism in liver ===
[[Image:Hepatic drug metabolism.svg|thumb|Drug metabolism in liver: transferases are : glutathione, sulfate, acetate, glucoronic acid. P-450 is cytochrome P-450 enzymes. 3 different pathways are depicted for Drugs A, B and C.]]
The human body identifies almost all drugs as foreign substances (i.e. [[xenobiotics]]) and subjects them to various chemical processes (i.e. [[metabolism]]) to make them suitable for elimination. This involves chemical transformations to (a) reduce fat solubility and (b) to change biological activity. Although almost all tissues in the body have some ability to metabolize chemicals, [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in the liver is the principal "metabolic clearing house" for both [[endogenous]] chemicals (e.g., [[cholesterol]], steroid hormones,  [[fatty acids]], [[proteins]]) and [[exogenous]] substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Donald Blumenthal |author2=Laurence Brunton |author3=Keith Parker |author4=Lazo, John S. |author5=Iain Buxton |title=Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Digital Edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year= 2006|pages= |isbn=0-07-146804-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals makes it susceptible to drug-induced injury.

[[Drug metabolism]] is usually divided into two phases: ''phase 1'' and ''phase 2''. Phase 1 reaction is thought to prepare a drug for phase 2. However many compounds can be metabolized by phase 2 directly. Phase 1 reaction involves [[oxidation]], [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]], [[hydrolysis]], [[hydration reaction|hydration]] and many other rare chemical reactions. These processes tend to increase water solubility of the drug and can generate metabolites that are more chemically active and potentially toxic. Most of phase 2 reactions take place in  [[cytosol]] and involve conjugation with endogenous compounds via [[transferase]] enzymes. Chemically active phase 1 products are rendered relatively inert and suitable for elimination by this step.

A group of [[enzyme]]s located in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as [[cytochrome P-450]], is the most important family of metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Cytochrome P-450 is the terminal [[oxidase]] component of an [[electron transport chain]]. It is not a single enzyme, but rather consists of a closely related family of 50 [[isoform]]s; six of them metabolize 90% of drugs.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7487-6011-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Skett, Paul |author2=Gibson, G.

Three important characteristics of the P-450 system have roles in drug-induced toxicity:
:'''1. Genetic diversity:'''
Each of the P-450 proteins is unique and accounts (to some extent) for the variation in drug metabolism between individuals. Genetic variations ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) in P-450 metabolism should be considered when patients exhibit unusual sensitivity or resistance to drug effects at normal doses. Such polymorphism is also responsible for variable drug response among patients of differing ethnic backgrounds.

:'''2. Change in enzyme activity:'''
Many substances can influence the P-450 enzyme mechanism. Drugs interact with the enzyme family in several ways.&lt;ref name="pmid9469685"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michalets EL |title=Update: clinically significant cytochrome P-450 drug interactions |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=84–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9469685 |doi=10.1002/j.1875-9114.1998.tb03830.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that modify cytochrome P-450 enzyme are referred to as either inhibitors or inducers. Enzyme inhibitors block the metabolic activity of one or several P-450 enzymes. This effect usually occurs immediately. On the other hand, inducers increase P-450 activity by increasing its synthesis. Depending on the inducing drug's half life, there is usually a delay before enzyme activity increases.&lt;ref name="pmid17708140"/&gt;

:'''3. Competitive inhibition:'''
Some drugs may share the same P-450 specificity and thus competitively block their bio transformation. This may lead to accumulation of drugs metabolized by the enzyme. This type of drug interaction may also reduce the rate of generation of toxic substrate.

Chemicals produce a wide variety of clinical and [[pathological]] hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. [[alanine transferase]], [[alkaline phosphatase]] and [[bilirubin]]) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) [[alanine transferase|ALT]] level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) [[alkaline phosphatase|ALP]] level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP.&lt;ref name="pmid16710915"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bénichou C |title=Criteria of drug-induced liver disorders. Report of an international consensus meeting |journal=J. Hepatol. |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=272–6 |year=1990 |pmid=2254635 |doi=10.1016/0168-8278(90)90124-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial [[Alanine transferase]] elevation) and [[cholestatic]] (initial alkaline phosphatase rise) types. However they are not mutually exclusive and mixed types of injuries are often encountered.

Specific [[Morphology (biology)|histo-pathological]] patterns of liver injury from drug-induced damage are discussed below.

====Zonal Necrosis====

This is the most common type of drug-induced liver cell [[necrosis]] where the injury is largely confined to a particular zone of the [[liver lobule]]. It may manifest as a very high level of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and severe disturbance of liver function leading to [[acute liver failure]].
:Causes include:
:[[Paracetamol]], [[carbon tetrachloride]]

====Hepatitis====

In this pattern, [[hepatitis|hepatocellular necrosis]] is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany [[lymphocyte|lymphocytic]] infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis is very similar to [[autoimmune hepatitis]] clinically, serologically, and histologically.
:Causes:
:(a) Viral hepatitis: [[Halothane]], [[isoniazid]], [[phenytoin]]
:(b) Focal hepatitis: [[Aspirin]]
:(c) Chronic hepatitis: [[Methyldopa]], [[diclofenac]]

====[[Cholestasis]]====

Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and cases are predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland (without any [[parenchymal]] inflammation). On rare occasions, it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts ([[Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome|Vanishing duct syndrome]]).
:Causes:
:(a) Bland: [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptive pills]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[androgens]]
:(b) Inflammatory: [[Allopurinol]], [[co-amoxiclav]], [[carbamazepine]]
:(c) Ductal: [[Chlorpromazine]], [[flucloxacillin]]

====[[Steatosis]]====

Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation, which leads to either small-droplet (microvesicular) or large-droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis by which phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g., [[Tay-Sachs disease]])
:Causes:
:(a) Microvesicular: [[Aspirin]] ([[Reye's syndrome]]), [[ketoprofen]], [[tetracycline]] (especially if expired)
:(b) Macrovesicular: [[Acetamenophen]], [[methotrexate]]
:(c) Phospholipidosis: [[Amiodarone]], [[total parenteral nutrition]]
:(d) [[Antiviral]]: [[nucleoside analogue]]s
:(e) [[Corticosteroid]]
:(f) Hormonal: [[Tamoxifen]]

====[[Granuloma]]====

Drug-induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. More than 50 drugs have been implicated.
: Causes:
:[[Allopurinol]], [[phenytoin]], [[isoniazid]], [[quinine]], [[penicillin]], [[quinidine]]

====Vascular lesions====

These result from injury to the vascular endothelium.
:Causes:
:[[Venoocclusive disease]]: Chemotherapeutic agents, bush tea
:[[Peliosis hepatis]]: Anabolic steroids
:[[Budd-Chiari syndrome|Hepatic vein thrombosis]]: Oral contraceptives

====[[Neoplasm]]====

Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and liver adenomas are the ones usually reported.
:Causes:
:[[Vinyl chloride]], [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], [[anabolic steroid]], [[arsenic]], [[thorotrast]]

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Assessment of hepatotoxicity.svg|thumb|Algorithm for suspected drug induced hepatic toxicity]]
This remains a  challenge in clinical practice due to a lack of reliable markers.&lt;ref name="pmid17230599"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andrade RJ, Robles M, Fernández-Castañer A, López-Ortega S, López-Vega MC, Lucena MI |title=Assessment of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in clinical practice: a challenge for gastroenterologists |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=329–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17230599 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v13.i3.329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other conditions lead to similar clinical as well as pathological pictures. To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arundel C, Lewis JH |title=Drug-induced liver disease in 2006 |journal=Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=244–54 |year=2007 |pmid=17414839 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e3280b17dfb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in acetaminophen toxicity, well established, dose-dependent, pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot. Several clinical scales such as [[Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences|CIOMS]]/RUCAM scale and Maria and Victorino criteria have been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. [[CIOMS/RUCAM scale]] involves a scoring system that categorizes the suspicion into "definite or highly probable" (score &gt; 8), “probable” (score 6-8), “possible” (score 3-5), “unlikely” (score 1-2) and “excluded” (score ≤ 0). In clinical practice, physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity (e.g., cholestatic damage in  [[Co-amoxiclav|amoxycillin-clauvonic acid]] ).&lt;ref name="pmid17230599"/&gt;

== Treatment and prognosis ==
In most cases, liver function will return to normal if the offending drug is stopped early. Additionally, the patient may require supportive treatment. In [[acetaminophen toxicity]], however, the initial insult can be fatal. Fulminant hepatic failure from drug-induced hepatotoxicity may require liver transplantation. In the past, glucocorticoids in allergic features and ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic cases had been used, but there is no good evidence to support their effectiveness.

An elevation in serum bilirubin level of more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity and is likely to lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped ([[Hy's Law]]).&lt;ref name="pmid14768020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reuben A |title=Hy's law |journal=Hepatology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=574–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14768020 |doi=10.1002/hep.20081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16618822"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arora N, Goldhaber SZ |title=Anticoagulants and transaminase elevation |journal=Circulation |volume=113 |issue=15 |pages=e698–702 |year=2006 |pmid=16618822 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.603100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or [[Gilbert syndrome]]) would not lead to jaundice.

[[File:Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumbnail|Ancient Egyptian sundial (c. 1500 BC), from the Valley of the Kings, used for measuring work hour. Daytime divided into 12 parts.]]
[[File:Louxor obelisk Paris dsc00780.jpg|thumb|right|80px|The [[Luxor Obelisk]] in [[Place de la Concorde]], [[Paris, France]]]]
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians were one of the first cultures to widely divide days into generally agreed-upon equal parts, using early [[History of timekeeping devices|timekeeping devices]] such as [[sundial]]s, shadow clocks, and merkhets ([[plumb-line]]s used by early astronomers).&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |website=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2008-04-02 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |archivedate=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA28,M1|title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day|page=28|last=Whitrow|first=G. J.|year=1989|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-285211-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Obelisks are used by reading the shadow that it makes. The citizens could divide the day into two parts, and then into smaller hours.

==Sundials and shadow clocks==
Despite [[Herodotus]]'s attribution of the invention of the sundial to the [[Babylonia]]ns in 430 BCE, the earliest known sundials were simple [[gnomon]]s of Egyptian origin invented around 3500 BCE. More complex devices were developed over time, the earliest surviving one is a limestone sundial that dates back to 1500 BCE, discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily_2013_03_14&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314085052.htm |website= [[Science Daily]] |title= One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt |date= 2013-03-14 |accessdate= 2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in a housing area of construction workers and its division of daytime into 12 parts was possibly used to measure work hours.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily_2013_03_14/&gt; Shadow clocks were modified sundials that allowed for greater precision in determining the time of day, and were first used around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; Their major innovation was a modified, more precise gnomon that allowed for the division of [[Daytime (astronomy)|night time]] into 50 parts, with an additional two "[[twilight]] hours" in the morning and evening. The shadow clock gnomon was made up of a long stem divided into six parts, as well as an elevated crossbar that cast a shadow over the marks. This early clock was positioned eastward in the morning, while at [[noon]] it was rotated to face west to measure shadows cast by the setting sun.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; The concept of measured shadows were adapted into larger, more public designs in the form of [[obelisk]]s. Markers around the obelisk would indicate units of time, including morning and afternoon as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;

==Merkhets==
Using plumb-lines called "''[[merkhet]]s''", the Egyptians could calculate time at night, provided the stars were visible.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt; Used since at least 600 BCE, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the North [[pole star]], creating a north-south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt; By observing certain [[star]]s as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets'', they could accurately gauge time.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Kahuta Project}}

As early as the 1970s, the early stage of the Pakistan's [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|atomic bomb program]] focused on its primary efforts on producing and developing a [[Weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] [[Nuclear device|device]] under the research led by [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC).&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan|first1=Feroz Hassan|title=Eating grass : the making of the Pakistan bomb|date=2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.

After disagreeing with [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood|Sultan Mahmood]]'s calculation and feasibility report submitted to the government, [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] detached the work from the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] and made Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] the director of the [[uranium enrichment]] project in 1976. The [[uranium enrichment|uranium project]] was moved to [[Kahuta Tehsil|Kahuta]] where the project was established as Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL). According to Dr. [[A.Q.

Wanting a capable administrator, Bhutto asked the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] for the selection, and the [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer-in-Chief]] chose [[Brigadier]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar]] to lead the program.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2009" /&gt; Because the experiments were deemed too dangerous to conduct in a major city, the operations were moved in a remote mountainous [[Northern Areas|northern areas]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online" /&gt;  The entire site and the [[Kahuta]] was rebuilt by the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] under [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar]], with logistics provided by [[Military Engineering Service]].&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DIrectorate of Inter-Services Public Relations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News iNternational, Part-XIII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ibid.|title=Part-XIII|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-275655-Unsung-heroes|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=News iNternational|publisher=News iNternational, Part-XIII|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducting a classified research, the facility was heavy secured by both the [[Pakistan Army]] and the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF).&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;  All employees needed badges to pass a checkpoint, and the laboratories are electronically fenced and guarded.&lt;ref name="Susanne Koelbl of the Spiegel Online"/&gt;

The ERL was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] at the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]].&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Some renowned scientists preferably Dr. G.D. Alam (Theoretical physicist) from [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] had joined the ERL and enriched the uranium at Kahuta. Dr. Anwar Ali and some other scientists also support him.&lt;ref name="News International, Part X"/&gt;&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=From the Memoirs of Dr. A.Q.

The [[Uranium-235|U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;]] containing only ~0.7% [[Enrichment of uranium|enriched]] material is brought to more than 90.0% through three stages of enrichment, leaving the original material [[Depleted uranium|depleted]] from 0.7% to 0.2%, which then now at both civilian and [[Weapon-grade|military-grade]].&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII"/&gt; In the 1970s, the ERL heavily depended on [[URENCO]]'s method but lessened the dependence in 1979 after local methods were developed. Unverified claims were made by KRL in [[Fiscal year|1983–84]] of conducting [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] [[List of nuclear weapons tests|tests]].&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII" /&gt; After visiting the site in May 1981, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] renamed the ERL as {{small|'''Khan Research Laboratory (KRL)'''}} in the honor of its founder and senior scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]].&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists (FAS)"/&gt; The KRL established a system of [[Computer numerical control|numerical control]] to control the [[Ultracentrifuge|centrifuges]] in 1983. By 1986, the KRL began producing the [[High-enriched uranium|HEU]]s as well as developing the [[Krytron]] while classified work on the uranium [[nuclear weapon design|weapon-design]] took place with &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;[[uranium hexafluoride|UF]] being reduced to [[uranium metal]] and machined into weapon pits. The KRL began publishing series of academic articles on [[Numerical methods|numerics]] and [[Computational Science and Engineering|computational methods]] on centrifuge design, including a 1987 article co-authored by Qadeer Khan on techniques for balancing sophisticated [[ultracentrifuge]] rotors.&lt;ref&gt;Upadhyaya, Gopal S.

In the 1990s, KRL became a home of a number of the most high-performance [[High-performance computing|supercomputer]] and [[parallel computing]] systems that were installed at the facility.&lt;ref name="News International, Part X"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ibid. et. al.|title=Part-X|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-271543-Unsung-heroes|accessdate=24 October 2014|agency=News International|publisher=News International, Part X|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) division was established which specialized in conducting high performance [[Computational science|computations]] on [[shock waves]] in [[nuclear weapons|weapons effect]] from the outer surface to the inner core by using the difficult [[differential equations]] of the state of the materials used in the bomb under high pressure.&lt;ref name="News International, Part XII" /&gt;

In an investigative reports published by [[Nuclear Threat Initiative|NTI]], the [[PR China|Chinese]] scientists were reportedly present at [[Kahuta]] in early 1980s— an unconfirmed indicator of Chinese assistance in the development of equipment at Kahuta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/pakistan/kahuta.htm Khan Research Laboratories]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[U.S. intelligence community|U.S. intelligence]] maintained that [[People's Republic of China|China]] provided [[Magnetic field|magnetic rings]] for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders. In 2005, it was revealed that [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia]]'s [[Zia regime|military government]] had the KRL to run a project of HEU programme in the [[Chinese nuclear weapons program|Chinese nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="Kan, Shirley A. 2009 pp. 5" /&gt; Abdul Qadeer Khan also alleged that "KRL has built a centrifuge facility for China in [[Hanzhong]] province".&lt;ref name="Kan, Shirley A. 2009 pp. 5"/&gt;

==Extended research==

The KRL supports and provides research opportunities program at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] (GCU) in [[Lahore]]; it supports its physics program through funding and providing scholarship to physics and engineering students at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]].&lt;ref name="GC University Press release"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer, et. al. |first1=Dept.

==National security program==

Apart from researching on uranium and developing the uranium enrichment facilities, the KRL includes a [[ballistic missile]]-space research laboratories&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org" /&gt; that competes with the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] to produce advanced ballistic missiles ranging for targeting enemy combatant targets and the space exploration. Its space-missile exploration projects based on producing the [[Liquid fuels|liquid fuel]] [[liquid fuel rocket|rockets]] in comparison to [[solid fuel]] [[solid-fuel rocket|rockets]] projects of the  [[National Development Complex]] (NDC). The KRL's missile projects are widely believed to be based on North Korean technology; exchanges took place in the late 1990s. The following missiles have been produced by KRL:&lt;ref name="nti.org" /&gt;
* [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri I]] (Hatf V) – first tested in 1999.
* [[Ghauri-II|Ghauri II]] – has a range of 2,000–2,500&amp;nbsp;km.
* [[Hatf-I]]

The KRL performs variety of weapons science and engineering projects for Pakistan Armed Forces. Since the 1980s, the KRL is involved in numerous military equipment and conventional weaponry development projects. The resulting systems have been put into service by the Pakistan's military and exported to other friendly nations. The following is a list of known equipment produced under these projects:&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nti.org"/&gt;

* Guided missiles:
** [[Anza (missile)|Anza series]] of [[MANPADS|man-portable air defence system]]s.
** [[Baktar-Shikan]] man-portable [[anti-tank guided missile]] (ATGM) system.
** Modules for the [[BGM-71 TOW]] ATGM.
* Electrical and electronic equipment:

'''Dr. Leslie A. Baxter''' (born 17 January 1949 in [[Portland, Oregon]]), United States is a scholar and teacher in [[communication studies]], best known for her research on family and relational communication. Her work is focused on relationships: romantic, marital, and friendly. She is best known for her [[Relational dialectics|Relational Dialectics]] theory.

==Background==
Baxter attended [[Madison High School (Portland, Oregon)|Madison High School]] and graduated in 1964.

Dr. Baxter stayed in Portland during her college years and attended [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]], where she studied communications. She received a bachelor's degree in 1971 and continued her studies with Speech-Communication at the [[University of Oregon]], where she received her master's degree in 1972. In 1975, Baxter received a Ph.D. from the [[University of Oregon]] in Speech-Communication. She is currently a professor at [[University of Iowa]] in Communication Studies.

Dr. Baxter started her work as a professor at the [[University of Montana]] and served her time there from 1975 to 1976. From 1976 to 1989, she was a faculty member in the Communications Department at Lewis &amp; Clark College, where she had received her undergraduate degree. During the last two years at Lewis &amp; Clark, she was the Associate Provost. Dr. Baxter then moved to California where, from 1989 to 1994, she taught in the Rhetoric and Communication Department as well as the Human Development Graduate Group at the [[University of California-Davis]]. In 1994, she moved to [[Iowa]] where she started her career as a Communication Studies professor at the [[University of Iowa]]. From 2000 to 2010, she was the F. Wendell Miller Professor, where she held the maximum period of professorship. In 2004, Dr. Baxter was the secondary appointment in the College of Public Health, Department of Community &amp; Behavioral Health at the University of Iowa. In 2012, she became a Collegiate Fellow in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

==Scholarly work==

Dr. Baxter's work focuses on researching family and relational communication. Relational Dialectics Theory, which was created by Baxter and Barbara Montgomery, has been mentioned in books and scholarly journals and received awards. Relational Dialectics Theory is recognizing that all communication is the interplay of differences. Baxter has been awarded for her work in communication and dedication to teaching.

In one of her published articles, "Problematizing the Problem in Communication: A Dialogic Perspective," Baxter discusses the problems within dialogue. She compares her thoughts on dialogue to [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s dialogism. She also compares her ideas with relational dialectics with an interview conducted by Em Griffin, an author of ''A First Look at Communication Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/video_transcript_11.pdf|title=Interview transcript, AFirstLook.com, January 2014|last=Griffin|first=Em|date=|website=A First Look|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that differences in relationships are what give it a wholeness, where as Bakhtin’s reference to dialogue isn’t used in "the sense of a happy, pleasant experience".

For Baxter’s study on family communication, ''Topic Expansiveness and Family Communication Patterns'' discovers individual’s binary decision in engaging disclosure or avoidance within communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie A.|last2=Akkoor|first2=Chitra|date=2011-01-14|title=Topic Expansiveness and Family Communication Patterns|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15267431003773523|journal=Journal of Family Communication|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/15267431003773523|issn=1526-7431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used 122 parents and their children to find communication patterns of avoidance, like sexual issues and topics of drinking/drugs, money, and educational progress. The topics were relative to friendships and everyday activities that would change the dialogue. The four topics of adolescent dating, family relationship rules, family relationship concerns, and traditions were the final grouped topics. ''Parental Rule Socialization for Preventive Health and Adolescent Rule Compliance'' looked into family rules rather than their communication pattern. Rules like nutrition, exercise, and sun protection in 164 families were examined. The outcome of this study showed that parents reported higher rule articulation than their children within the three topics. In 2014, another study was published about family communication. The study ''Discursive Constructions of the Meaning of "Family" in Online Narratives of Foster Adoptive Parents'' examined normativity of families, seeing if shared genetics established as a legitimate family. The study showed that it was the importance of dialogue of families that defined a "family", rather than how the family is constructed.

Leslie Baxter spent her career teaching and conducting research at universities around the Western part of the United States. One study to examine college student’s communication was to look at how 109 Midwestern university students used their health communication on a daily basis. The results were that impact of health communication varied by every topic, channel, relationship, and purpose whether that were to seek help for their health or have interpersonal communication (face-to-face, phone, and/or email).

Romantic relationships are another topic Dr. Baxter has researched. In one study done with William Wilmot, they used fourteen categories of tests in which lovers test the seriousness of their significant other’s commitment. They finalized results of women relying on secrets tests more often than men. For example, introducing their lover as "my boyfriend". They also concluded that men and women used different kinds of tests. A study done with Daena Goldsmith looked at communication in dating couples. They researched taboo subjects and what couples avoid talking about.

[[Systems science]] is the [[interdisciplinary]] field of science surrounding [[systems theory]], [[cybernetics]], the science of [[complex systems]]. It aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations, which are applicable in a variety of areas, such as engineering, biology, medicine and social sciences. Systems science and [[systemics]] are names for all research related to [[systems theory]]. It is defined as an emerging branch of science that studies [[holistic]] systems and tries to develop logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, [[cognitive]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems can be studied and developed.

This '''list of systems sciences organizations''' gives an overview of global and local [[organization]]s in the field of [[systems science]]. This list shows all kinds of organizations and institutes listed thematically.

'''Marlboro College Graduate and Professional Studies''', known informally as '''Marlboro College Graduate School''', was founded in 1997 by [[Marlboro College]] and is located on the college's main campus in [[Marlboro, Vermont]]. It is accredited with the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828132004/http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/#Vermont#Vermont|title=Roster of Institutions - New England Association of Schools and Colleges: Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (CIHE)|date=2013-08-28|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduate school uses a blended learning model that combines online learning with small face-to-face classes that meet after work or on weekends.

Programs include: 
* Master of Arts in Teaching for Social Justice (includes K-12 teacher licensure)
* Master of Arts in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)
* Master of Business Administration
* Master of Science in Management
* Continuing education courses 
* [https://www.marlboro.edu/community/cnl Certificates] for professional development for workers in nonprofits or mission-driven organizations
* [https://www.marlboro.edu/community/cnl/consulting Consulting] for nonprofits or mission-driven organizations

From 1997 to 2018 Marlboro College's graduate school ran a very well regarded Masters of Arts in Teaching with Technology program. The program catered to mainly Vermont public school teachers and had very active and respected alumni in the state. The program granted a Masters, certificate in Educational Technology and the Vermont Educational Technology Specialist endorsement credits.

Marlboro College Graduate School is no longer located in the former Marlboro College Graduate Center, at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/28+Vernon+St,+Brattleboro,+VT+05301/@42.8502025,-72.5584405,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e11a4f67bdec21:0x11cc9e8ff9ed9b51!8m2!3d42.8502025!4d-72.5562518 28 Vernon Street, Brattleboro, Vermont], where several other tenants are still located.

'''Maya Widmaier-Picasso''' (Boulogne-Billancourt, France, 1935) is the daughter of Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Ruiz Picasso]] and [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]]. She has devoted part of her life to the study and preservation of the legacy of her father.

Maya is notably represented in the series of Picasso paintings ''Maya à la poupée.''

She was married to Pierre Widmaier and has had three children: Olivier, Richard, and [[Diana Widmaier Picasso|Diana]]. Diana is an art historian specialized in the work of her grandfather Pablo Picasso.

In 2017, [[Gagosian Gallery]] presented in Paris the exhibition ''Picasso and Maya: Father and Daughter'', curated by [[Diana Widmaier Picasso]]. It was the first exhibition devoted to Picasso's portraits of his eldest daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/10285/the-show-exploring-picassos-relationship-with-his-daughter|title=The Show Exploring Picasso’s Relationship with His Daughter|last=AnOther|date=2017-10-20|work=AnOther|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Records of guidelines related to "people skills" have been found as early as the New Testament. Five examples of early human guidelines appear in the [[Bible]]. [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 4:8-9 advises: "Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaining."; and [[Solomon]]'s wisdom in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:1 includes: "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.", along similar lines in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 16:21 includes: "The wise of heart is called perceptive, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness."; [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 5:14 dictates: "And we urge you, beloved, to discourage the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them."; [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:2 advises: " To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone."; and in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:2 encourages: "Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the [[Golden Rule|law]] of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human relations|Human-relations]] studies emerged in the 1920s when companies became more interested in "[[soft skills]]" and interpersonal skills of employees.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In organizations, improving people skills became a specialized role of the [[corporate trainer]]. By the mid-1930s, [[Dale Carnegie]] popularized people skills in ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' and ''[[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living]]'' worldwide.

In the 1960s, US schools introduced people-skills topics and methods—often as a way to promote better [[self-esteem]], communication and social interaction. These encompassed psychologist [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]]'s "Effectiveness Training" variations as well as many other training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Schaps, E.; Cohen, A.Y.; and Resnik, H.S.: [http://www.pire.org/detail.asp?detayl=y&amp;core=11989 "Balancing Head and Heart"] PIRE.

(By the 1980s, "[[traditional education]]" and a "back-to-basics" [[The three Rs|three-Rs]] emphasis largely pushed these programs aside,&lt;ref&gt;Doll, R.C. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/32/83/49.pdf "Humanizing Education by Improving Communication"] ERIC.

The first documented use of the phrase "people skills" was around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=People+skills&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bpeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20Skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPEOPLE%20SKILLS%3B%2Cc0 Ngram for people skills]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==
The SCANS report states that business, labor and government authorities agree that having a wide range of people skills are necessary for 20th-century work success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/SCANS/ "Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)"] US Dept. of Labor. Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; Skills like customer service, building effective relationships, and teamwork are among the abilities most requested by employers in job postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/baseline-skills/ "The Human Factor: The Hard Time Employers Have Finding Soft Skills,"] Burning Glass Technologies, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of these skills is considered a serious psychological handicap. Constructive leadership based companies engage in helping individuals to grow, and through that growth employees take more responsibility and discharge it effectively. This in-turn will enhance the basic attitude of the individual; and that will reflect the general level of performance in workplace.  Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/human-relations|title=Human Relations facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Human Relations|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence A. Appley]] of American Management Association, reflected on these trainings as a responsibility to "increase the knowledge, sharpen and add to the skills, improve the habits, and change the attitudes of many of those for whose development we are responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood F Merrill &amp; Elizabeth Marting (1952). Developing Executive Skills, American Management Association, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of people skills among upper echelons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0713&lt;/ref&gt; (top management) can result in [[bullying]] and/or [[harassment]], which is not uncommon in the modern workplace due to changing values. The causes that are most identified with the situation are lack of necessary motivation, communication, influencing skills and [[empathy gap]] among upper echelons (Gilbert and Thompson, 2002). Training company staff in people skills and interpersonal skills increases the morale and dignity at work (Best, 2010). Employers that do not take steps to prevent harassment can face major costs in decreased productivity, low morale, increased absenteeism and health care costs, and potential legal expenses.

'''Sir Peter Paul Rubens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|uː|b|ən|z}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rubens "Rubens"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nl|ˈrybə(n)s|lang}}; 28 June 1577 – 30 May 1640) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artist. He is considered the most influential artist of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] tradition. Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

In addition to running a large studio in [[Antwerp]] that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholar]] and diplomat who was [[knight]]ed by both [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Charles I of England]]. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by [[Michael Jaffé]] lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/1979/153/1/doctoraat.pdf Nico Van Hout, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

His commissioned works were mostly "[[history painting]]s", which included religious and mythological subjects, and hunt scenes. He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the [[ephemeral]] decorations of the [[royal entry]] into Antwerp by the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]] in 1635.

His drawings are predominantly very forceful and without great detail. He also made great use of [[oil sketch]]es as preparatory studies.  He was one of the last major artists to make consistent use of [[panel painting|wooden panels]] as a support medium, even for very large works, but he used [[canvas]] as well, especially when the work needed to be sent a long distance. For [[altarpiece]]s he sometimes painted on [[slate]] to reduce reflection problems.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
[[File:GARDENS IN THE RUBENS HOUSE - ANTWERP.jpg|thumb|The garden designed by Rubens at the [[Rubenshuis]] in [[Antwerpen]]]]

Rubens was born in the city of [[Siegen]] to [[Jan Rubens]] and [[Maria Pypelincks]]. He was named in honour of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]], because he was born on [[Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul|their solemnity]].&lt;ref&gt;Historische levensbeschryving van P.P. Rubens Door Jean Francois Marie Michel. p.14&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and mother fled Antwerp for [[Cologne]] in 1568, after increased religious turmoil and persecution of [[Protestant]]s during the rule of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] by [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd&amp;nbsp;Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alba]].

Jan Rubens became the legal adviser (and lover) of [[Anna of Saxony]], the second wife of [[William the Silent|William&amp;nbsp;I of Orange]], and settled at her court in Siegen in 1570, fathering her daughter Christine who was born in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Erik Midelfort, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dDu1OHSZ1_8C&amp;pg=PA58 "Mad Princes of Renaissance Germany"], page 58, University of Virginia Press, 22 January 1996. Retrieved 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jan Rubens' imprisonment for the affair, Peter Paul Rubens was born in 1577. The family returned to Cologne the next year. In 1589, two years after his father's death, Rubens moved with his mother Maria Pypelincks to Antwerp, where he was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].

Religion figured prominently in much of his work, and Rubens later became one of the leading voices of the Catholic Counter-Reformation style of painting&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (he had said "My passion comes from the heavens, not from earthly musings").

=== Apprenticeship ===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Portrait of a Young Scholar - WGA20349.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of a Young Scholar'', from 1597]]

In Antwerp, Rubens received a [[Renaissance humanist]] education, studying Latin and classical literature. By fourteen he began his artistic apprenticeship with [[Tobias Verhaeght]]. Subsequently, he studied under two of the city's leading painters of the time, the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists [[Adam van Noort]] and [[Otto van Veen]].&lt;ref&gt;Held (1983): 14–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his earliest training involved copying earlier artists' works, such as [[woodcut]]s by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]]s after [[Raphael]]. Rubens completed his education in 1598, at which time he entered the [[Guild of St. Luke]] as an independent master.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 22–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1600 Rubens travelled to Italy. He stopped first in [[Venice]], where he saw paintings by [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and [[Tintoretto]], before settling in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&amp;nbsp;I Gonzaga]]. The colouring and compositions of [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Tintoretto had an immediate effect on Rubens's painting, and his later, mature style was profoundly influenced by [[Titian]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 42; 57.&lt;/ref&gt; With financial support from the Duke, Rubens travelled to [[Rome]] by way of [[Florence]] in 1601. There, he studied classical Greek and Roman art and copied works of the Italian masters.  The [[Hellenistic]] sculpture ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' was especially influential on him, as was the art of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 52–57&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the recent, highly naturalistic paintings by [[Caravaggio]].

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Fall of Phaeton (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''[[The Fall of Phaeton (Rubens)|The Fall of Phaeton]]'', 1604, in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.]]

Rubens later made a copy of Caravaggio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Antwerp he was instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Sirjacobs, Raymond. ''Antwerpen Sint-Pauluskerk: Rubens En De Mysteries Van De Rozenkrans = Rubens Et Les Mystères Du Rosaire = Rubens and the Mysteries of the Rosary'', Antwerpen: Sint-Paulusvrienden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  During this first stay in Rome, Rubens completed his first altarpiece commission, ''St.&amp;nbsp;Helena with the True Cross'' for the Roman church of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]].

Rubens travelled to Spain on a diplomatic mission in 1603, delivering gifts from the Gonzagas to the court of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Medici Grand Duchy and Rubens' First Trip to Spain|last = Rosen|first = Mark|journal = Oud Holland|issue = Vol. 121, No. 2/3|year = 2008|pages = 147–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he studied the extensive collections of Raphael and Titian that had been collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted an equestrian portrait of the [[Francisco Goméz de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]] during his stay (Prado, Madrid) that demonstrates the influence of works like Titian's ''[[:File:Tizian 082.jpg|Charles V at Mühlberg]]'' (1548; Prado, Madrid). This journey marked the first of many during his career that combined art and diplomacy.

He returned to Italy in 1604, where he remained for the next four years, first in Mantua and then in [[Genoa]] and Rome. In Genoa, Rubens painted numerous portraits, such as the ''[[:File:Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria.jpg|Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria]]'' (National Gallery of Art, Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.), and the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra Pallavicini, in a style that influenced later paintings by [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubens Madonna on Floral Wreath.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Madonna on Floral Wreath'', together with Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1619]]

He also began a book illustrating the palaces in the city, which was published in 1622 as ''[[Palazzi di Genova]]''. From 1606 to 1608, he was mostly in Rome. During this period Rubens received, with the assistance of Cardinal Jacopo Serra (the brother of Maria Pallavicini), his most important commission to date for the High Altar of the city's most fashionable new church, [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] also known as the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].

The subject was to be [[St. Gregory the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;Gregory the Great]] and important local saints adoring an [[icon]] of the Virgin and Child. The first version, a single canvas (now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the "Santa Maria in Vallicella" to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé (1977): 85–99; Belting (1994): 484–90, 554–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens' experiences in Italy continued to influence his work. He continued to write many of his letters and correspondences in Italian, signed his name as "Pietro Paolo Rubens", and spoke longingly of returning to the peninsula—a hope that never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antwerp (1609–1621) ===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Peter Paul Rubens - The Artist and His First Wife, Isabella Brant, in the Honeysuckle Bower.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rubens and [[Isabella Brandt]], the [[Honeysuckle Bower]]'', c. 1609. [[Alte Pinakothek]]]]

Upon hearing of his mother's illness in 1608, Rubens planned his departure from Italy for Antwerp. However, she died before he arrived home. His return coincided with a period of renewed prosperity in the city with the signing of the [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)|Treaty of Antwerp]] in April 1609, which initiated the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. In September 1609 Rubens was appointed as court painter by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], sovereigns of the [[Low Countries]].

He received special permission to base his studio in Antwerp instead of at their court in [[Brussels]], and to also work for other clients. He remained close to the Archduchess Isabella until her death in 1633, and was called upon not only as a painter but also as an ambassador and diplomat. Rubens further cemented his ties to the city when, on 3 October 1609, he married [[Isabella Brandt]], the daughter of a leading Antwerp citizen and humanist, Jan Brandt.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20230.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', 1618. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

In 1610 Rubens moved into a new house and studio that he designed. Now the [[Rubenshuis]] Museum, the Italian-influenced villa in the centre of Antwerp accommodated his workshop, where he and his apprentices made most of the paintings, and his personal art collection and library, both among the most extensive in Antwerp. During this time he built up a studio with numerous students and assistants. His most famous pupil was the young [[Anthony van Dyck]], who soon became the leading Flemish portraitist and collaborated frequently with Rubens. He also often collaborated with the many specialists active in the city, including the animal painter [[Frans Snyders]], who contributed the eagle to ''[[Prometheus Bound (Rubens)|Prometheus Bound]]'' (c. 1611-12, completed by 1618), and his good friend the flower-painter [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]].

Another house was built by Rubens to the north of Antwerp in the [[polder]] village of [[Doel]], "Hooghuis" (1613/1643), perhaps as an investment. The "High House" was built next to the village church.

Altarpieces such as ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'' (1610) and ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (1611–1614) for the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|Cathedral of Our Lady]] were particularly important in establishing Rubens as Flanders' leading painter shortly after his return. ''The Raising of the Cross'', for example, demonstrates the artist's synthesis of [[:File:Jacopo Tintoretto 021.jpg|Tintoretto's ''Crucifixion'']] for the [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] in Venice, [[Michelangelo]]'s dynamic figures, and Rubens' own personal style. This painting has been held as a prime example of Baroque religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1977): 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens used the production of [[Old master print|prints]] and book title-pages, especially for his friend [[Balthasar Moretus]], the owner of the large [[Plantin Press|Plantin-Moretus publishing house]], to extend his fame throughout Europe during this part of his career. In 1618, Rubens embarked upon a printmaking enterprise by soliciting an unusual triple privilege (an early form of [[copyright]]) to protect his designs in France, the Southern Netherlands, and United Provinces.&lt;ref name=Hottle&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek|last=Hottle|first=Andrew D.|title=Commerce and Connections: Peter Paul Rubens and the Dedicated Print|volume=55|year=2004|pages=54–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted [[Lucas Vorsterman]] to engrave a number of his notable religious and mythological paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals in the Southern Netherlands, United Provinces, England, France, and Spain.&lt;ref name=Hottle/&gt; With the exception of few [[etching]]s, Rubens left the [[printmaking]] to specialists, who included Lucas Vorsterman, [[Paulus Pontius]] and [[Willem Panneels]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauw-De Veen (1977): 243–251.&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited a number of engravers trained by [[Christoffel Jegher]], who he carefully schooled in the more vigorous style he wanted. Rubens also designed the last significant [[woodcut]]s before the 19th-century revival in the technique.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no.427–32, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marie de' Medici Cycle and diplomatic missions (1621–1630) ===
{{Main|Marie de' Medici cycle}}

In 1621, the Queen Mother of France, [[Marie de' Medici]], commissioned Rubens to paint two large allegorical cycles celebrating her life and the life of her late husband, [[Henry IV of France|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]], for the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris. The [[Marie de' Medici cycle]] (now in the Louvre) was installed in 1625, and although he began work on the second series it was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 175; 192; Held (1975): 218–233, esp. pp. 222–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie was exiled from France in 1630 by her son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and died in 1642 in the same house in Cologne where Rubens had lived as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anna of Austria by Rubens (1622-1625, Norton Simon Museum).jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]]'', Queen of France, c.1622–1625]]

After the end of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Spanish [[Habsburg]] rulers entrusted Rubens with a number of diplomatic missions.&lt;ref name="peace"&gt;Belkin (1998): 199–228.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Paris in 1622 to discuss the Marie de' Medici cycle, Rubens engaged in clandestine information gathering activities, which at the time was an important task of diplomats.  He relied on his friendship with [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] to get information on political developments in France.&lt;ref&gt;Auwers: p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1627 and 1630, Rubens' diplomatic career was particularly active, and he moved between the courts of Spain and England in an attempt to bring peace between the Spanish Netherlands and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  He also made several trips to the northern Netherlands as both an artist and a diplomat.

At the courts he sometimes encountered the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands in any art or trade, but he was also received as a gentleman by many.  Rubens was raised by Philip&amp;nbsp;IV of Spain to the nobility in 1624 and knighted by Charles I of England in 1630.  Philip IV confirmed Rubens' status as a knight a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Auwers: p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens was awarded an honorary [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree from [[Cambridge University]] in 1629.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 339–340&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens was in Madrid for eight months in 1628–1629. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, he executed several important works for Philip&amp;nbsp;IV and private patrons. He also began a renewed study of Titian's paintings, copying numerous works including the Madrid ''Fall of Man'' (1628–29).&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 210–218.&lt;/ref&gt; During this stay, he befriended the court painter [[Diego Velázquez]] and the two planned to travel to Italy together the following year. Rubens, however, returned to Antwerp and Velázquez made the journey without him.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 004.jpg|thumb|''[[The Fall of Man (Rubens)|The Fall of Man]]'', 1628–29. Prado, Madrid]]

His stay in Antwerp was brief, and he soon travelled on to London where he remained until April 1630. An important work from this period is the ''Allegory of Peace and War'' (1629; [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng46 |title=Minerva protects Pax from Mars ('Peace and War') |accessdate=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113432/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG46 |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It illustrates the artist's lively concern for peace, and was given to Charles I as a gift.

While Rubens' international reputation with collectors and nobility abroad continued to grow during this decade, he and his workshop also continued to paint monumental paintings for local patrons in Antwerp. The ''[[Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Rubens)|Assumption of the Virgin Mary]]'' (1625–6) for the Cathedral of Antwerp is one prominent example.

=== Last decade (1630–1640) ===
Rubens's last decade was spent in and around Antwerp. Major works for foreign patrons still occupied him, such as the ceiling paintings for the [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Inigo Jones]]'s [[Palace of Whitehall]], but he also explored more personal artistic directions.

In 1630, four years after the death of his first wife Isabella, the 53-year-old painter married his first wife's niece, the 16-year-old [[Hélène Fourment]]. Hélène inspired the voluptuous figures in many of his paintings from the 1630s, including ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 117.jpg|The Feast of Venus]]'' (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 026.jpg|The Three Graces]]'' and ''[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgment of Paris]]'' (both Prado, Madrid). In the latter painting, which was made for the Spanish court, the artist's young wife was recognized by viewers in the figure of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. In an intimate portrait of her, ''Hélène Fourment in a Fur Wrap'', also known as ''[[Het Pelsken]]'', Rubens' wife is even partially modelled after classical sculptures of the [[Venus Pudica]], such as the [[Venus de' Medici|Medici Venus]].

In 1635, Rubens bought an estate outside Antwerp, the [[Elewijt Castle|Steen]], where he spent much of his time. Landscapes, such as his ''[[Château de Steen with Hunter]]'' (National Gallery, London) and ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 102.jpg|Farmers Returning from the Fields]]'' (Pitti Gallery, Florence), reflect the more personal nature of many of his later works. He also drew upon the Netherlandish traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] for inspiration in later works like ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 014.jpg|Flemish Kermis]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1630; Louvre, Paris).

=== Death ===
Rubens died from heart failure, a result of his chronic [[gout]], on 30 May 1640. He was interred in [[Saint James' Church, Antwerp]]. His epitaph read:&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen - Parochiekerken ; 1. Afdeeling, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His nudes of various biblical and mythological women are especially well-known. Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and highly sexualized beings, his nudes emphasize the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skillfully rendered, these paintings of nude women were undoubtedly created to appeal to his largely male audience of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=431556|title=Review on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque'). And while the [[male gaze]] features heavily in Rubens's paintings of females generally, he brings multi-layered allegory and symbolism to his portraits.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424300308.html|title=Gender in Art – Dictionary definition of Gender in Art {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His large-scale cycle representing Marie de Medicis focuses on several classic female archetypes like the virgin, consort, wife, widow, and diplomatic regent.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3177384|title=Rubens's France: Gender and Personification in the Marie de Médicis Cycle on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of this iconography in his female portraits, along with his art depicting noblewomen of the day, serve to elevate his female portrait sitters to the status and importance of his male portrait sitters.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Rubens's depiction of males is equally stylized, replete with meaning, and quite the opposite of his female subjects. His male nudes represent highly athletic and large mythical or biblical men. Unlike his female nudes, most of his male nudes are depicted partially nude, with sashes, armour, or shadows shielding them from being completely unclothed. These men are twisting, reaching, bending, and grasping: all of which portrays his male subjects engaged in a great deal of physical, sometimes aggressive, action. The concepts Rubens artistically represents illustrate the male as powerful, capable, forceful and compelling. The allegorical and symbolic subjects he painted reference the classic masculine tropes of athleticism, high achievement, valour in war, and civil authority.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Male archetypes readily found in Rubens's paintings include the hero, husband, father, civic leader, king, and the battle weary.

Rubens was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci's work. Using an engraving done 50 years after Leonardo started his project on the Battle of Anghiari, Rubens did a masterly drawing of the Battle which is now in the Louvre in Paris. "The idea that an ancient copy of a lost artwork can be as important as the original is familiar to scholars," says Salvatore Settis, archaeologist and art historian.

Paintings from Rubens' workshop can be divided into three categories: those he painted by himself, those he painted in part (mainly hands and faces), and those he only supervised as other painters produced them from his drawings or [[oil sketch]]es. He had, as was usual at the time, a large workshop with many apprentices and students, some of whom, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], became famous in their own right. He also often sub-contracted elements such as animals or [[still-life]] in large compositions to specialists such as [[Frans Snyders]], or other artists such as [[Jacob Jordaens]].

{{Science|expanded=phil/hist}}

'''Philosophy of science''' is a sub-field of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[epistemology]], for example, when it explores the relationship between science and [[truth]].

There is no consensus among philosophers about many of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the [[scientific realism|truth about unobservable things]] and [[problem of induction|whether scientific reasoning can be justified]] at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as [[philosophy of biology|biology]] or [[philosophy of physics|physics]]). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.

While philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of [[Aristotle]], philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century in the wake of the [[logical positivism]] movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' was also formative, challenging the view of [[scientific progress]] as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a "[[paradigm]]," the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324460/Thomas-S-Kuhn Thomas S. Kuhn.] "Instead, he argued that the paradigm determines the kinds of experiments scientists perform, the types of questions they ask, and the problems they consider important."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.

Subsequently, the [[Coherentism|coherentist]] approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] and others. Some thinkers such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] seek to ground science in [[axiomatic]] assumptions, such as the [[uniformity of nature]]. A vocal minority of philosophers, and [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) in particular, argue that there is no such thing as the "[[scientific method]]", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly [[supernatural]] ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how [[Constructivist epistemology|knowledge is created]] from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, an approach represented by scholars like [[David Bloor]] and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]]. Finally, a tradition in [[continental philosophy]] approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.

Philosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|time]] raised by Einstein's [[general relativity]], to the implications of [[Philosophy and economics|economics]] for [[public policy]]. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be [[Reductionism|reduced]] to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual [[Philosophy of psychology|psychology]]? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the [[foundations of statistics]]. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the [[philosophy of medicine]]. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the [[Philosophy of social science|social sciences]] explore whether the scientific studies of [[human nature]] can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and by social relations.

==Introduction==

===Defining science===
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Popper in the 1980s]]
Distinguishing between science and [[non-science]] is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should [[psychoanalysis]] be considered science? How about so-called [[creation science]], the [[Multiverse|inflationary multiverse]] hypothesis, or [[macroeconomics]]? [[Karl Popper]] called this the central question in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Thornton2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|title = Karl Popper|accessdate = 2007-12-01|last = Thornton|first = Stephen|year = 2006|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Laudan | first = Larry | editor = Adolf Grünbaum |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |editor3=Larry Laudan | title = Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum | year = 1983 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-90-277-1533-3 | chapter = The Demise of the Demarcation Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] has argued for the use of a [[Potter Stewart standard]] ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SqOPw9Yq-MEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pseudoscience+potter+stewart#v=onepage&amp;q=pseudoscience%20potter%20stewart&amp;f=false|pages = 12–13|title = The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe|first = Michael D.|last = Gordin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780226304427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or [[junk science]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;– pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

===Scientific explanation===
{{Main|Scientific explanation}}

A closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide [[explanation]]s for events that occur regularly or have already occurred.  Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has [[explanatory power]].

One early and influential theory of scientific explanation is the [[deductive-nomological]] model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a [[scientific law]].&lt;ref name="Hempel1948"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Wesley C. Salmon|Wesley Salmon]] developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained.&lt;ref name="Salmon1971"&gt;{{cite book

===Justifying science===
{{Main|Problem of induction}}
[[File:Chicken farmer in Ghana (5926941911).jpg|thumb|The expectations chickens might form about farmer behavior illustrate the "problem of induction."]]
Although it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests.&lt;ref name="StanInduction"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/|title = The Problem of Induction|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Vickers|first1 = John|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use [[inductive reasoning]] to infer that the farmer will bring food ''every'' morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?

One approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more [[Probability|probable]]. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are [[Bayesian probability|subjective]], or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.&lt;ref name=StanInduction/&gt;

Some argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather [[abductive reasoning]], or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the "best explanation." [[Ockham's razor]], which counsels choosing the [[Simplicity|simplest]] available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this [[heuristic]] principle more precise in terms of theoretical [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.&lt;ref name="StanSimple"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/|title = Simplicity|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Baker|first1 = Alan|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature.  In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1998) [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press; (2017) [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress: Aim-Oriented Empiricism], Paragon House, St. Paul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation inseparable from theory===
[[Image:Einstein cross.jpg|thumb|right|A celestial object known as the [[Einstein Cross]].]]
When making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], observers would have likely interpreted the image at right as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and [[Gravitational lens|four different images]] of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be [[theory-laden]].&lt;ref name="StanTheoryObs"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation/|title = Theory and Observation in Science|accessdate = 2014-02-25|last1 = Bogen|first1 = Jim|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All observation involves both [[philosophy of perception|perception]] and [[cognitive process|cognition]]. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.&lt;ref name=StanTheoryObs/&gt;

===The purpose of science===
{{See also|Scientific realism|Instrumentalism}}

Should science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science [[Empirical limits in science|cannot answer]]?  ''Scientific realists'' claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard [[scientific theories]] as true, approximately true, or likely true.  Conversely, ''scientific anti-realists'' argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about [[unobservable]]s like electrons or other universes.&lt;ref name="Levin1984"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalists]] argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.

Realists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories.&lt;ref name="Boyd2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Specific examples include:

===Values and science===
Values intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society.

If it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="StanSocial"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|title = The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|accessdate = 2014-03-06|last1 = Longino|first1 = Helen|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on [[evolution]], and values concerning [[social class]] influenced debates on [[phrenology]] (considered scientific at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allchin, "Values in Science and in Science Education," in International Handbook of Science Education, B.J. Fraser and K.G. Tobin (eds.), 2:1083–1092, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist epistemology|Feminist philosophers of science]], sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.

==History==
{{See also|History of scientific method|History of science|History of philosophy}}

===Pre-modern===
The origins of philosophy of science trace back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference, and also analyzed reasoning by [[analogy]]. The eleventh century Arab polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in Latin as [[Alhazen]]) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied [[geometry]], especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the [[Catoptrics|reflection]] and [[Dioptrics|refraction]] of light. [[Roger Bacon]] (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48233-0|pages=350–351|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lOCriv4rSCUC&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=alhazen+philosophy+of+science#v=onepage&amp;q=alhazen%20philosophy%20of%20science&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian.

Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]
[[Francis Bacon]] (no direct relation to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]]. In his work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620) – an allusion to Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]'' – Bacon outlined a new [[system of logic]] to improve upon the old philosophical process of [[syllogism]]. Bacon's method relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Bacon, Francis]] ''[[Novum Organum]] (The New Organon)'', 1620. Bacon's work described many of the accepted principles, underscoring the importance of empirical results, data gathering and experiment.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911), "[[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bacon, Francis|Bacon, Francis]]" states: [In Novum Organum, we ] "proceed to apply what is perhaps the most valuable part of the Baconian method, the process of exclusion or rejection. This elimination of the non-essential,&amp;nbsp;..., is the most important of Bacon's contributions to the logic of induction, and that in which, as he repeatedly says, his method differs from all previous philosophies."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', advocating the central role of [[rationalism|reason]] as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' argued that "...&amp;nbsp;hypotheses&amp;nbsp;... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. "&lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paricenter.com/library/papers/mullin02.php |title= The Impact of Newton's Principia on the Philosophy of Science  |last1= McMullin |first1= Ernan |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.paricenter.com |publisher= Pari Center for New Learning |access-date=29 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage influenced a "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy."  &lt;ref name="www.paricenter.com mullin02"/&gt; In particular, later in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] would famously articulate [[skepticism]] about the ability of science to determine [[causality]] and gave a definitive formulation of the [[problem of induction]].  The 19th century writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
[[Instrumentalism]] became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces [[verificationism]] (a set of [[epistemology|theories of knowledge]] that combines [[logicism]], [[empiricism]], and [[linguistics]] to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the [[empirical sciences]]). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new ''scientific philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxiv&gt;Michael Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR14 p xiv].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and the [[Vienna Circle]] propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.

Interpreting [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|philosophy of language]], logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness.  From [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's [[logical atomism]], [[Ernst Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]—whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology—and [[Percy Bridgman]]'s [[operationalism]]. Thereby, only the ''verifiable'' was scientific and ''cognitively meaningful'', whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements"—metaphysical, emotive, or such—not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.

Logical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable—even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles—but that is an exaggeration.  Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical—direct observations viewed in the abstract—or at worst metaphysical or emotional.  ''Theoretical laws'' would be reduced to ''empirical laws'', while ''theoretical terms'' would garner meaning from ''observational terms'' via ''correspondence rules''.   Mathematics in physics would reduce to [[symbolic logic]] via logicism, while [[rational reconstruction]] would convert [[natural language|ordinary language]] into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a [[logical syntax]].  A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a [[logical calculus]] or [[operationalism|empirical operation]] could verify its falsity or truth.

In the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.  By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[physicalism]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] had sought to replace ''verification'' with simply ''confirmation''.  With [[World War II]]'s close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, ''logical empiricism'', led largely by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], in America, who expounded the [[covering law model]] of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of "causation".  The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and dominated [[Anglosphere]] philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s.  Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems,&lt;ref name="Smith1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=L.D. |last=Smith |year=1986 |title=Behaviorism and Logical Positivism: A Reassessment of the Alliance |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1301-6 |lccn=85030366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZ6aAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 |page=314 |quote=The secondary and historical literature on logical positivism affords substantial grounds for concluding that logical positivism failed to solve many of the central problems it generated for itself. Prominent among the unsolved problems was the failure to find an acceptable statement of the verifiability (later confirmability) criterion of meaningfulness. Until a competing tradition emerged (about the late 1950's), the problems of logical positivism continued to be attacked from within that tradition. But as the new tradition in the philosophy of science began to demonstrate its effectiveness—by dissolving and rephrasing old problems as well as by generating new ones—philosophers began to shift allegiances to the new tradition, even though that tradition has yet to receive a canonical formulation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-06606-7 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of [[Ptolemy]], [[David Hume|Hume]], d'Alembert, [[August Compte|Compte]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Ernst Mach]].

However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists.

[[File:Epicycle and deferent.svg|thumb|For [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], the addition of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal science" within a paradigm, whereas the [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions#The Copernican Revolution|Copernican revolution]] was a paradigm shift.]]

===Thomas Kuhn===
{{Main|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}}

In the 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', [[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a [[logically consistent]] "portrait" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. A paradigm also encompasses the set of questions and practices that define a scientific discipline. He characterized ''normal science'' as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas ''revolutionary science'' occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a [[paradigm shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure [[scientific progress]] across paradigms.

For Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="KuhnP206"&gt;T. S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 2nd. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1970, p. 206. {{ISBN|0-226-45804-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.

==Current approaches==
===Naturalism's axiomatic assumptions===
All scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Priddy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitehead|1997|p=135}} ,  “All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.”&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]] concurs that all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For naturalists, nature is the only reality, the only paradigm.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality.&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is the implicit philosophy of working scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strahler|1992|p=3}} The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;/ref&gt; The following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed." "Our belief that objective reality exist is an assumption that it arises from a real world outside of ourselves.  As infants we made this assumption unconsciously.   People are happy to make this assumption that adds meaning to our sensations and feelings, than live with [[solipsism]]."&lt;ref&gt;

It seems more beneficial to assume that an objective reality exists than to live with solipsism, and so people are quite happy to make this assumption. In fact we made this assumption unconsciously when we began to learn about the world as infants. The world outside ourselves appears to respond in ways which are consistent with it being real.  The assumption of objectivism is essential if we are to attach the contemporary meanings to our sensations and feelings and make more sense of them.

===Coherentism===
{{main|Coherentism}}
[[File:JeremiahHorrocks.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremiah Horrocks]] makes the first observation of the transit of Venus in 1639, as imagined by the artist [[William Richard Lavender|W.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Lavender]] in 1903]]

In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/justep-coherence/|title = Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Olsson|first = Erik|year = 2014|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prediction of a [[transit of Venus]] is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the [[optics]] of telescopes, the [[mechanics]] of the telescope mount, and an understanding of [[celestial mechanics]]. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, according to the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]], it is impossible to test a theory in isolation.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Dunhem–Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's Law of Gravitation]] in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets.  Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of [[Uranus]] in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, [[Neptune]]. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One consequence of the Duhem–Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable ''ad hoc'' hypotheses. [[Karl Popper]] accepted this thesis, leading him to reject [[Falsifiability#Naïve falsification|naïve falsification]]. Instead, he favored a "survival of the fittest" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.&lt;ref name="Popper 2005ch3-4"&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Popper

===Anything goes methodology===

{{Main|Epistemological anarchism}}

[[File:Paul Feyerabend Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Karl Feyerabend]]]]

[[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924–1994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the progress of science. He argued that "the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: ''anything goes''".&lt;ref name="contra"&gt;Paul Feyerabend, ''Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'' (1975), {{ISBN|0-391-00381-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-222-1}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-481-X}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-646-4}}, {{ISBN|0-86091-934-X}}, {{ISBN|0-902308-91-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features. and thus had become increasingly an [[ideology]]. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from [[religion]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[mythology]]. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as [[authoritarian]] and ungrounded.&lt;ref name="contra"/&gt; Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of "the worst enemy of science" from his detractors.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of scientific knowledge methodology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
According to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community.&lt;ref name="KuhnPostParadigm"&gt;{{cite book | author = Kuhn, T. S.| chapter = [Postscript] | title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 3rd. ed | publisher = [Univ. of Chicago Pr] | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | authorlink = Thomas Samuel Kuhn|page = 176|quote = A paradigm is what the members of a community of scientists share, ''and'', conversely, a scientific community consists of men who share a paradigm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a [[Social constructionism|social construct]].

However, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer&amp;nbsp;... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as ''cultural posits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Quine, Willard Van Orman| chapter = Two Dogmas of Empiricism | title = From a Logical Point of View | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1980 | isbn = 978-0-674-32351-3 | url = http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the [[science wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Ashman|editor1-first= Keith M.|editor2-last= Barringer|editor2-first= Philip S.|title= After the Science Wars|date= 2001|publisher= Routledge|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-415-21209-0|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XImEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=After+the+science+wars#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20science%20wars&amp;f=false|accessdate= 29 October 2015|quote= The 'war' is between scientists who believe that science and its methods are objective, and an increasing number of social scientists, historians, philosophers, and others gathered under the umbrella of Science Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including [[David Bloor]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Bruno Latour]], and [[Anselm Strauss]]. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from [[Economics of scientific knowledge|economics have also been applied]]{{by whom|date=October 2017}} for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Here the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.

===Continental philosophy===
Philosophers in the [[continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]] are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] advanced the thesis in his "The Genealogy of Morals" that the motive for search of truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hatab|first1=Lawrence J.|title=How Does the Ascetic Ideal Function in Nietzsche's ''Genealogy''?|journal=The Journal of Nietzsche Studies|date=2008|issue=35/36|page=107|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v035/35.hatab.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In general, science in continental philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective.  One of the first philosophers who supported this view was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Philosophers such as [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Gaston Bachelard]] also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the late works of [[Merleau-Ponty]] (''Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France'', 1956–1960), and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name="Gutting"&gt;Gutting, Gary (2004), ''Continental Philosophy of Science'', Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the [[present-at-hand|theoretical attitude]] in general which of course includes the scientific attitude.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2015"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/|title = Martin Heidegger|accessdate = 2015-10-29|last = Wheeler|first = Michael|year = 2015|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, [[Alexandre Koyré]].  Another important development was that of Michel [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s analysis of the historical and scientific thought in ''[[The Order of Things]]'' and his study of power and corruption within the "science" of [[Insanity|madness]]. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include [[Jürgen Habermas]] (e.g., "Truth and Justification", 1998), [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and [[Wolfgang Stegmüller]] ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).

==Other topics==
===Reductionism===

[[Analysis]] is the activity of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. [[Reductionism]] can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref name="StanUnity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-unity/|title = The Unity of Science|accessdate = 2014-03-01|last1 = Cat|first1 = Jordi|year = 2013|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls ''[[greedy reductionism]],'' which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=George|title=Darwin Loves You: Natural Selection and the Re-enchantment of the World|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13639-4|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/?id=koy-zqecyewC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=dennett+%22greedy+reductionism%22+%22bad+science%22#v=onepage&amp;q=dennett%20%22greedy%20reductionism%22%20%22bad%20science%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social accountability===
{{See also|The Mismeasure of Man}}
A broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, what part of the world and man is studied by science. [[Philip Kitcher]] in his "Science, Truth, and Democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, P. Science, Truth, and Democracy, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; argues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.

In addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.&lt;ref name="StanPhilNeuro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/neuroscience/ |title = The Philosophy of Neuroscience |last1 = Bickle|first1 = John|last2 = Mandik|first2 = Peter|last3 = Landreth|first3 = Anthony|year = 2010 |website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|postscript= (Summer 2010 Edition) |editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first= Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the typical test yields a [[p-value]], which is the probability of the ''evidence'' being such as it is, under the assumption that the hypothesis being tested is true. If the ''p''-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, [[Bayesian inference]] seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include [[probability interpretations]], [[overfitting]], and the difference between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].

Is asking whether "1+1=2" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was [[calculus]] invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires [[A priori and a posteriori|experience or reason alone]]. What does it mean to prove a mathematical [[theorem]] and how does one know whether a [[mathematical proof]] is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and [[logic]], human capabilities such as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]], and the [[material universe]].

{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
{{unsolved|physics|How does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the "[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states" and "[[wavefunction collapse]]", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}
Philosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions underlying modern [[physics]], the study of [[matter]] and [[energy]] and how they [[interaction|interact]]. The main questions concern the nature of [[Philosophy of space and time|space and time]], [[atom]]s and [[atomism]]. Also included are the predictions of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]], [[causality (physics)|causality]], [[determinism]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Philosophy of chemistry===
{{Main|Philosophy of chemistry}}
Philosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the [[methodology]] and content of the science of [[chemistry]]. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by [[quantum mechanics]] or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of [[Philosophy of science#Confirmation of theories|how theories are confirmed]] in the context of confirming [[reaction mechanism]]s. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of.&lt;ref name="WeisbergEtal2011"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chemistry/|title = Philosophy of Chemistry|accessdate = 2014-02-14|last1 = Weisberg|first1 = Michael|last2 = Needham|first2 = Paul|last3 = Hendry|first3 = Robin|year = 2011|website = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as [[chemical bonds]].

===Philosophy of Earth sciences===
The philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists’ ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.

===Philosophy of biology===
{{Main|Philosophy of biology}}
Philosophy of biology deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[ethics|ethical]] issues in the [[Biology|biological]] and [[Medical research|biomedical]] sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., [[Aristotle]], [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hull D. (1969), What philosophy of biology is not, Journal of the History of Biology, 2, p.&amp;nbsp;241–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in [[genetic engineering]].  Other key ideas such as the [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] of all life processes to [[biochemical]] reactions as well as the incorporation of [[psychology]] into a broader [[neuroscience]] are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]]'s work),&lt;ref&gt;Recent examples include Okasha S. (2006), ''Evolution and the Levels of Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, and Godfrey-Smith P. (2009), ''Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Witzany G. (2010). "Biocommunication and Natural Genome Editing". Dortrecht: Springer Sciences and Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of medicine===
{{Main|Philosophy of medicine}}

Beyond [[medical ethics]] and [[bioethics]], the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]/[[metaphysics]] of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, [[evidence-based medicine]] (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation,&lt;ref name="Papineau 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papineau | first1 = D | year = 1994 | title = The Virtues of Randomization | url = | journal = British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 437–450 | doi=10.1093/bjps/45.2.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worrall 2002"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3081103 Jstor], Worrall, J., 2002.

Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include [[Cartesian dualism]], the monogenetic conception of disease&lt;ref name="Lee 2012"&gt;Lee, K., 2012.

Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena. Causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.g. what causes disease, or what causes people to get better.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cartwright | first1 = N | year = 2009 | title = What are randomised controlled trials good for? | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 147 | issue = 1| pages = 59–70 | doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of psychology===
{{Main|Philosophy of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]
Philosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of [[behaviorism|behavior]] to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on [[mentalism (psychology)|mental perception and thought processes]]?&lt;ref name="Routpsych"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mason|first1 = Kelby|first2 = Chandra Sekhar|last2 = Sripada|first3 = Stephen|last3 = Stich|title = Routledge Companion to Twentieth-Century Philosophy|chapter = Philosophy of Psychology|chapterurl = http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~stich/Publications/Papers/PHILOSOPHYofPSYCHOLOGY.pdf|editor-last = Moral|editor-first = Dermot|publisher = Routledge|location = London|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a [[Likert scale]], they may be experiencing very different things.

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]]. For example, are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?&lt;ref name="Routpsych" /&gt; Is there any sense in which they have [[free will]], and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, [[neurophilosophy]] has just recently become its own field with the works of [[Paul Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].&lt;ref name=StanPhilNeuro/&gt; Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]]. Another related field is [[philosophy of language]].

A notable recent development in Philosophy of Psychology is [[Functional contextualism|Functional Contextualism]] or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general, the field of [[behavior analysis]], and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT).&lt;sup&gt;[[Functional contextualism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

===Philosophy of psychiatry===
{{main|Philosophy of psychiatry}}
Philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to [[psychiatry]] and [[mental illness]]. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the [[philosophy of mind]] and [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Dominic (Spring 2015). "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/psychiatry/ Philosophy of Psychiatry]". ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', edited by Edward N. Zalta. Accessed 18 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Amartya Sen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for "combining tools from economics and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Prize in Econimic Sciences 1998 |website=NobelPrize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/press.html |date=1998-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Philosophy of economics===
{{Main|Philosophy and economics}}
Philosophy of economics is the branch of philosophy which studies philosophical issues relating to [[economics]]. It can also be defined as the branch of economics which studies its own foundations and morality. It can be categorized into three central topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/economics/ |title=Philosophy of Economics|last1=Hausman |first1=Daniel |last2= |first2= |date= December 18, 2012 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first concerns the definition and scope of economics and by what methods it should be studied and whether these methods rise to the level of epistemic reliability associated with the other special sciences. For example, is it possible to research economics in such a way that it is value-free, establishing facts that are independent of the normative views of the researcher? The second topic is the meaning and implications of rationality. For example, can buying lottery tickets (increasing the riskiness of your income) at the same time as buying insurance (decreasing the riskiness of your income) be rational? The third topic is the normative evaluation of economic policies and outcomes. What criteria should be used to determine whether a given public policy is beneficial for society?

===Philosophy of social science===
{{Main|Philosophy of social science}}
The philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the [[social sciences]], such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Hollis |author-link=Martin Hollis (philosopher)|year=1994 |title=The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-44780-5 |url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the [[natural science]]s, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the [[ontology|ontological]] significance of [[structure and agency]].

The French philosopher, [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), established the epistemological perspective of [[positivism]] in ''The Course in Positivist Philosophy'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]: "''[[sociology|sociologie]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt; For Comte, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. These are (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and [[social research]]. [[Durkheim]], [[Marx]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]] are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In [[psychology]], a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in [[behaviourism]]. Positivism has also been espoused by '[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]]' who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The positivist perspective has been associated with '[[scientism]]'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer [[bias]] and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as [[Thomas Kuhn]], and new philosophical movements such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and [[neopragmatism]].  The philosopher-sociologist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poppers''' is a [[slang|slang term]] given broadly to the [[chemical class]] called [[alkyl nitrites]], that are [[inhalant|inhaled]] for [[recreational drug]] purposes, typically for the "high" or "rush" that the drug can create. Poppers have also been historically used for [[sexual intercourse|sexual encounters]] among youth, including in the [[LGBT community|gay community]].&lt;ref name="poppers-gay-culture"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/poppers-how-gay-culture-bottled-a-formula-that-has-broken-down-boundaries-a6828466.html |title=How gay culture bottled a formula that has broken down boundaries |date=2016-01-22 |newspaper=The Independent |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-01-23 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you trace the bottle of amyl (a type of alkyl nitrite) through late 20th&amp;nbsp;century history, you trace the legacies of gay culture on popular culture in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="poppers-gay-culture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Poppers were part of club culture from the mid-1970s [[disco]] scene to the 1980s, and the 1990s [[rave]] scene made their use popular again.&lt;ref name="Drugscope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |title=Nitrites |accessdate=2007-04-24 |work=Drugscope |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405132026/http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, to evade anti-drug laws, poppers are labelled or packaged as room deodorizers, leather polish, or tape head cleaner.

==History==
{{expand section | a sourced paragraph on the transition from its use in medicine to its use as a recreational drug | small = no|date=June 2016}}
The French chemist [[Antoine Jérôme Balard]] synthesized [[amyl nitrite]] in 1844.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton]], a Scottish physician born in the year of amyl nitrite's first synthesis, famously pioneered its use to treat [[angina pectoris]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Brunton was inspired by earlier work with the same agent, performed by [[Arthur Gamgee]] and [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Brunton reasoned that the angina sufferer's pain and discomfort could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite—to dilate the coronary arteries of patients, thus improving blood flow to the heart muscle.{{Citation needed|date= April 2014}}

Although amyl nitrite is known to have been used recreationally as early as the 1960s, the poppers "craze" began around 1975.&lt;ref name=Craze&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Israelstam |first1=Stephen |last2=Lambert |first2=Sylvia |last3=Oki |first3=Gustave |title=Poppers, a new recreational drug craze |journal=Canadian Psychiatric Association Journal |date=26 April 2017 |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=493–495 |doi=10.1177/070674377802300711 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/070674377802300711 |accessdate=25 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold in fragile glass ampoules which are crushed or "popped" in the fingers and then inhaled: Hence the colloquialism ''poppers''.&lt;ref name=Craze/&gt; The term extended to the drug in any form as well as the commercial variant of the drug, [[butyl nitrite]], which is packaged under a variety of trade names in small bottles.&lt;ref name=Craze/&gt;

==Use==

===Administration===
Poppers are inhaled.

This is typically done through the nasal or oral cavities, and any conditions which adversely affect the use of the respiratory system should be taken into account before administration commences.

[[File:Poppers.jpg|thumb|A selection of poppers]]
Through the 1970s, use by minors has been described as minimal, due to the ban on sales to minors by major manufacturers (for public relations reasons), and because some jurisdictions regulate sales to minors by statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nickerson, Mark |author2=Parker, John |author3=Lowry, Thomas |author4=Swenson, Edward |year=1979 |title=Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds |chapter=Sociology and Behavioral Effects |edition=1st |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Pharmex, Ltd.}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}} A 1987 study commissioned by the United States Senate and conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services found that less than three per cent of the overall population had ever used poppers.&lt;ref name = "Kennedy-1988"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kennedy, Edward (committee chair) |year=1988 |publisher=US Senate |department=Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources |series=Report of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources |title=Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments of 1988 |at=Section 4015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}}

===Interactions===
Alkyl nitrites [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other [[vasodilators]], such as [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[vardenafil]] (Levitra), and [[tadalafil]] (Cialis), to cause a serious [[hypotension|decrease in blood pressure]], which can cause fainting, stroke, and low blood pressure leading to potential heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romanelli |first1=F. |last2=Smith |first2=K.M. |title=Recreational use of sildenafil by HIV-positive and -negative homosexual/bisexual males |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1024–1030 |date=Jun 2004 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D571 |pmid=15113986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}}

==Legal status==

===Australia===
It is illegal to sell poppers as inhalants in Australia, although some, including amyl nitrite, are often sold in sex shops misleadingly labeled as DVD or leather cleaner.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/man-dead-rainbow-serpent-drunk-amyl-nitrate-poppers-sources-say/8227740&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, reformulated poppers containing [[isopropyl nitrite]] are sold in Europe; isobutyl nitrite is prohibited.&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2006%3A033%3A0028%3A0081%3Aen%3APDF |title=Directive 2005/90/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |date=January 18, 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrite has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000166136 |title=Decree 90–274 of 26 March 1990 |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000341445 |title=Decree 2007-1636 of 20 November 2007 |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on the grounds that the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000020868995 |title=Conseil d'État, 10ème et 9ème sous-sections réunies, 15/05/2009, 312449, Publié au recueil Lebon |language=fr |website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany, Austria, Switzerland====

The possession in the German speaking countries is not subject to any regulations regarding anesthetic drugs and is therefore legal; however, the purchase, sale or trade of amyl nitrite without permission violates the drug laws of the corresponding countries. Occasionally, poppers were seized from sex shops, when sold there illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.de/reisen-und-leben/855244035/zur-ekstase-geschnueffelt/1/ |title=Sexdroge Poppers: Zur Ekstase geschnüffelt |website=news.de |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article182967/Poppers-sichergestellt.html |title=„Poppers“ sichergestellt.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, poppers are sold in [[nightclub]]s, [[bar]]s, [[sex shop]]s, drug paraphernalia [[head shops]], over the Internet, and in markets. It is illegal under [[Medicines Act 1968]] to sell them advertised for human consumption. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] noted in 2011 that poppers, rather than being psychoactive substance or 'legal high', "appear to fall within the scope of [[The Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985]]".&lt;ref name=acmd&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119139/acmdnps2011.pdf |title=Consideration of the Novel Psychoactive Substances (‘Legal Highs’) |publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs |pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2016]], scheduled to be enacted April 1, 2016, was initially claimed to impose a blanket ban on the production, import and distribution of all poppers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0002/16002.pdf publications.parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2016 a motion to exempt poppers (alkyl nitrites) from this legislation was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160120/debtext/160120-0003.htm#16012033005245 |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 January 2016  (pt 0003) |work=parliament.uk |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by Conservative MP [[Ben Howlett (politician)|Ben Howlett]]. Howlett's fellow Conservative MP [[Crispin Blunt]] declared that he has used and currently uses poppers. Manufacturers expressed concern over loss of business and potential unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutcliffe |first1=Robert |title=UK's biggest poppers manufacturer vows to fight legal high ban on product he's made for 35 years |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uks-biggest-poppers-manufacturer-vows-7373648 |publisher=Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tayag |first1=Yasmin|title=The UK is at war with synthetic drugs and brain boosters are in the crossfire |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/11351-england-s-psychoactive-substances-act-puts-nootropic-poppers-on-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] stated that, because alkyl nitrites do not directly stimulate or depress the [[central nervous system]], poppers do not fall within the scope of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poppers-are-so-harmless-they-dont-even-fall-under-the-governments-legal-highs-ban-acmd-says-a6934096.html |title=The Government thought it had banned Poppers but actually accidentally didn't |website=The Independent |language=en-GB |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, amyl nitrite was originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937 and remained so until 1960, when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] removed the prescription requirement due to its food safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use.

Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the US by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law includes an exception for ''commercial purpose'', defined as any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 1QO-690, section 2404) (15 U.S.C. 2d57a(e)(2)).&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect in 1990.

Substances containing alkyl nitrites other than amyl nitrite are available at many retailers{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} – typically sex shops and stores that sell recreational-drug paraphernalia – and may be purchased legally.

The '''portraiture of Elizabeth I of England''' illustrates the evolution of English royal [[portrait]]s in the [[Early Modern period]] from the representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.

Even the earliest portraits of [[Elizabeth I]] (1533–1603) contain [[symbol]]ic objects such as [[rose]]s and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day. Later portraits of Elizabeth layer the [[iconography]] of [[empire]]—[[globe]]s, [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], [[sword]]s and [[column]]s—and representations of [[virginity]] and purity—such as [[moon]]s and [[pearl]]s—with [[Classical antiquity|classical]] allusions to present a complex "story" that conveyed to [[Elizabethan era]] viewers the majesty and significance of their Virgin Queen.

==Overview==

===Portraiture in Tudor England===
{{Main|Artists of the Tudor court}}
Two portraiture traditions had arisen in the Tudor court since the days of Elizabeth's father, [[Henry VIII]].  The [[portrait miniature]] developed from the [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition.  These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in [[watercolour]]s on [[vellum]] stiffened by being glued to a [[playing card]]. [[Panel painting]]s in [[oil painting|oils]] on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.

Unlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was appointed her official [[limning|limner]] or miniaturist and goldsmith. [[George Gower]], a fashionable court portraitist created [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from that date until his death in 1596.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth sat to a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, [[Cornelis Ketel]], [[Federico Zuccari|Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari]], [[Isaac Oliver]], and most likely to Gower and [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors.  Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen.  The fashionable [[long gallery|long galleries]] of later Elizabethan [[country house]]s were filled with sets of portraits.  The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved "face patterns" or drawings of the queen to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

===European context===
Far the most impressive models available to English portraitists were the many portraits by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the century, who had made two lengthy visits to England and been Henry VIII's court artist.  Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 25–6.  This was in notable contrast to France, in particular, where smaller portraits remained more typical until [[Henry IV of France]] came to power in 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; although none of his originals now survive.  His great [[Whitehall Mural|dynastic mural]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Remigius van Leemput 001.jpg|image of a copy]] Waterhouse:19–22, who points out that only very high ranking persons could enter the room where it was when the court was in residence at Whitehall.  But artists could probably have gained access during the long periods the monarch was elsewhere; certainly there are many apparent copies of the figure of Henry from this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Holbein and his great Italian contemporary [[Titian]] had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons.  By his second visit Holbein was already moving away from a strictly realist depiction; in his ''[[Jane Seymour]]'' "the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse:19&lt;/ref&gt;  This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where "Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Titian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of [[Philip II of Spain]], until the 1570s, but in sharply reduced numbers after about 1555, and he refused to travel from Venice to do them.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jennifer in: David Jaffé (ed), ''Titian'', pp. 31–2, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, {{ISBN|1-85709-903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full-length portrait of Philip (1550–51) now in the [[Prado]] was sent to Elizabeth's elder sister and predecessor [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in advance of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Tizian 084.jpg|Image]] It came from Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary]] in Brussels, presumably as a loan. Fletcher, op. cit. pp. 31 and 148.  It was presumably returned by or after Mary I's death in 1558, as it is in a Spanish royal inventory of 1600.  Prado:398–99 (#411). The painting has returned to London for an exhibition at the National Gallery until January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the mid-century the most influential Continental courts came to prefer less revealing and intimate works,&lt;ref&gt;For analysis of this trend see Levey (1971, Ch. 3, and Trevor-Roper (1976) Ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the mid-century the two most prominent and influential royal portraitists in paint, other than Titian, were the Netherlandish [[Anthonis Mor]] and [[Agnolo Bronzino]] in [[Florence]], besides whom the Habsburg court sculptor and medallist [[Leone Leoni]] should also be mentioned.  Mor, who had risen rapidly to prominence in 1540s, worked across Europe for the Habsburgs in a tighter and more rigid version of Titian's compositional manner, drawing also on the North Italian style of [[Moretto da Brescia|Moretto]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 27–8. For his relationship with the Habsburgs, see Trevor-Roper (1976) passim, who also covers those of Leone Leoni and Titian in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mor had actually visited London in 1554, and painted three versions of his well-known portrait of Queen Mary; he also painted English courtiers who visited Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), p. 28. Surviving portraits include those of [[Sir Thomas Gresham]] and [[Sir Henry Lee]], who was later to commission the ''Ditchley Portrait''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mor's Spanish pupil [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]] continued in a stiffer version of his master's style, replacing him  as Spanish court painter in 1561.  [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] had painted in an intimately informal style, but after her recruitment to the Spanish court as the Queen's painter in 1560 was able to adapt her style to the much more formal demands of state portraiture.  Moretto's pupil [[Giovanni Battista Moroni]] was Mor's contemporary and formed his mature style in the 1550s, but few of his spirited portraits were of royalty, or yet to be seen outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;And even in Italy his best portraits were routinely attributed to Titian or Moretto, for example what has always been his most famous work, the so-called ''Titian's Schoolmaster'', now in Washington but previously in the [[Palazzo Borghese]] in Rome.  Penny:194–5 on his life and style, 196–7 on his reputation. Freedberg (1993), pp. 593–5 analyses his portrait style.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronzino]] developed a style of coldly distant magnificence, based on the [[Mannerist]] portraits of [[Pontormo]], working almost entirely for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke.&lt;ref&gt;In an extended discussion, [[Michael Levey]] says Bronzino showed the ducal family "so wrought and congealed that there is nothing of living tissue left in them. Their hands have turned to ivory, and their eyes to pieces of beautifully cut, faceted jet." Levey (1971), pp. 96–108 — quotation from p. 108.  See also Freedberg (1993), pp. 430–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, [[Eleanor of Toledo]] were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing to be made for two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions.  At the least many of the foreign painters in London are likely to have seen versions of the earlier type, and there may well have been one in the [[Royal Collection]].

French portraiture remained dominated by small but finely drawn bust-length or half-length works, including many drawings, often with colour, by [[François Clouet]] following, with a host of imitators, his father [[Jean Clouet|Jean]], or even smaller oils by the Netherlandish [[Corneille de Lyon]] and his followers, typically no taller than a paperback book.  A few full-length portraits of royalty were produced, dependent on German or Italian models.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the royal image===
[[File:El bieta I lat 13.jpg|thumb|upright|''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'', c. 1546, by an unknown artist.]]
William Gaunt contrasts the simplicity of the 1546 portrait of ''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'' with later images of her as queen.  He wrote, "The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of [[Anne Boleyn]] as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of emphasis given to depicting depth and volume in her later portraits may have been influenced by the Queen's own views. In the ''Art of Limming'' Hilliard cautioned against all but the minimal use of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling that we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron: "seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light...Her Majesty..chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all..."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Hilliard's ''Art of Limming'', c. 1600, in ''Nicholas Hilliard'', [[Roy Strong]], 1975, p.24, Michael Joseph Ltd, London, {{ISBN|0-7181-1301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1570s, the government sought to manipulate the image of the queen as an object of devotion and veneration.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] writes: "The cult of Gloriana was skilfully created to buttress public order and, even more, deliberately to replace the pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] externals of religion, the cult of the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and [[saint]]s with their attendant images, processions, ceremonies and secular rejoicing."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The pageantry of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s, the poetry of the court, and the most iconic of Elizabeth's portraits all reflect this effort.  The management of the queen's image reached its heights in the last decade of the reign, when realistic images of the aging queen were replaced with an eternally youthful vision defying the reality of the passage of time.

===The young queen===
Portraits of the young queen, many of them likely painted to be shown to prospective suitors and foreign heads of state, show a naturalness and restraint similar to those in the portrait of Elizabeth as a princess.
[[File:Elizabeth I Steven Van Der Meulen.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Hampden Portrait'' of Elizabeth I, by Van Der Meulen, 1560s]]

The full-length ''Hampden'' image of Elizabeth in a red satin gown by [[Steven van der Meulen]] has been identified by Sir Roy Strong as an important early portrait, "undertaken at a time when her image was being tightly controlled. 'This is a portrait dating from the mid to late 1560s, one of a group produced in response to a crisis over the production of the royal image, one which was reflected in the words of a draft proclamation dated 1563,' he said."&lt;ref name="IND"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20071101/ai_n21092731 Portrait of a royal quest for a husband]". ''The Independent'', (London), Nov 1, 2007. Retrieved on 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft proclamation (never published) was a response to the circulation of poorly made portraits in which Elizabeth is shown "in blacke with a [[French hood|hoode and cornet]]", a style she no longer wore.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In these portraits Elizabeth may be wearing [[mourning]] for her sister Mary; see commentary on a portrait ([[:Image:Mary Queen of Scots French School c 1558-60.jpg|Image]]) of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in a similar black gown and French hood with the cornet or ''bongrace'' pinned up at {{cite web|url=http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |title=Mary Queen of Scots (1542 - 1587) c. 1558 |work=Historical Portraits Image Library |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016154526/http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}, where the costume is compared to Elizabeth's in the ''Clopton'' portrait type.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolism in these pictures is in keeping with earlier Tudor portraiture; in some Elizabeth holds a book (possibly a prayer book) suggesting studiousness or piety. In other paintings she holds or wears a red rose, symbol of the [[Tudor Dynasty]]'s descent from the [[House of Lancaster]], or white roses, symbols of the [[House of York]] and of maidenly chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Hampden portrait, Elizabeth wears a red rose on her shoulder and holds a [[gillyflower]] in her hand.  Of this image, Strong says "'Here Elizabeth is caught in that short-lived period before what was a recognisable human became transmuted into a goddess'."&lt;ref name="IND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This newly revealed portrait was sold at Sotheby's, London, for £2.6 million in November 2007.[https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSL2246809920071122?sp=true Reuters news story]&lt;/ref&gt;

One artist active in Elizabeth's early court was the [[Flanders|Flemish]] miniaturist [[Levina Teerlinc]] who had served as a painter and [[gentlewoman]] to [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and stayed on as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth. Teerlinc is best known for her pivotal position in the rise of the portrait miniature. There is documentation that she created numerous portraits of Elizabeth I, both individual portraits and portraits of the sovereign with important court figures, but only a few of these have survived and been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth and the goddesses===
[[File:Eworth Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses 1569.jpg|thumb|''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'', 1569]] Two surviving [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings show the early use of classical mythology to illustrate the beauty and sovereignty of the young queen.  In ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' (1569), attributed to [[Hans Eworth]],&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is signed "H.E." and the artist formerly identified as the "Monogrammist H.E." is now generally assumed to be Hans Eworth (Hearn 1995, p. 63). Strong had earlier attributed the painting to [[Joris Hoefnagel]] (Strong 1987, p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt; the story of the [[Judgement of Paris]] is turned on its head.  Elizabeth, rather than Paris, is now sent to choose among [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Athena|Pallas-Minerva]], all of whom are outshone by the queen with her crown and royal [[Globus cruciger|orb]].  As Susan Doran writes, "Implicit to the theme of the painting ... is the idea that Elizabeth's retention of royal power benefits her realm. Whereas Paris's judgement in the original myth resulted in the long [[Trojan War]]s 'to the utter ruin of the Trojans', hers will conversely bring peace and order to the state"&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; after the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].

The latter theme lies behind the 1572 ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' (attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]]).  In this image, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Mary and her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] are accompanied by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription states that this painting was a gift from the queen to [[Francis Walsingham]] as a "Mark of her people's and her own content" and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the [[Treaty of Blois (1572)]] which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, pp.185–86&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Hilliard was an apprentice to the Queen's jeweller Robert Brandon,&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; a goldsmith and city chamberlain of London, and Sir Roy Strong suggests that Hilliard may also have been trained in the art of limning by Levina Teerlinc.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was "desperately needed."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilliard's first known miniature of the Queen is dated 1572. It is not known when he was formally appointed limner (miniaturist) and goldsmith to Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Hilliard and Oliver'', pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt; though he was granted the reversion of a lease by the Queen in 1573 for his "good, true and loyal service."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Two panel portraits long attributed to him, the ''Phoenix'' and ''Pelican'' portraits, are dated c. 1572–76.  These paintings are named after the jewels the queen wears, her personal badges of the [[Pelican#Symbolism and culture|pelican in her piety]] and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].  National Portrait Gallery researchers announced in September 2010 that the two portraits were painted on wood from the same two trees. They also found that a tracing of the Phoenix portrait matches the Pelican portrait in reverse. They therefore deduce that both pictures of Elizabeth in her forties were painted around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11277451  Pelican and Phoenix research]&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hilliard's panel portraits seem to have been found wanting, and in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France to improve his skills.  Returning to England, he continued to work as a goldsmith, and produced some spectacular "picture boxes" or jewelled lockets for miniatures: the ''Armada Jewel'', given by Elizabeth to Sir [[Thomas Heneage]] and the ''Drake Pendant'' given to Sir [[Francis Drake]] are the best known examples.  As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen, courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness, at least at Court.

His appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and he was commissioned to decorate important documents, such as the founding [[charter]] of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (1584), which has an enthroned Elizabeth under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance strapwork and [[grotesque]] ornament.  He also seems to have designed [[woodcut]] title-page frames and borders for books, some of which bear his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, pp. 62 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Darnley Portrait'', c. 1575]]

===The Darnley Portrait===
The problem of an official portrait of Elizabeth was solved with the ''Darnley  Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;So-called from its location at [[Cobham House]], much later the seat of the [[Earls of Darnley]]; see Strong 1987 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Likely painted from life around 1575–6, this portrait is the source of a face pattern which would be used and reused for authorized portraits of Elizabeth into the 1590s, preserving the impression of ageless beauty.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] suggested that the artist is [[Federico Zuccari]] or Zucaro, an "eminent" Italian artist, though not really a specialist portrait-painter, who is known to have visited the court briefly with a letter of introduction to Elizabeth's [[favourite]] [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] dated 5 March 1575.&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;Strong 1987, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Zuccaro's preparatory drawings for full-length portraits of both Leicester and Elizabeth survive, although it is unlikely the full-length of Elizabeth was ever painted.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Curators at the National Portrait Gallery believe that the attribution of the Darnley portrait to Zuccaro is "not sustainable" and attribute the work to an unknown "continental" (possibly Netherlandish) artist.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Darnley Portrait'' features a crown and [[sceptre]] on a table beside the queen, and was the first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as [[Theatrical property|props]] (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of [[Red#Pigments and dyes|red lake pigments]], which has also altered the coloring of her dress.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors2"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 162-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Art"&gt;{{cite web|author = National Portrait Gallery |title = Making Art in Tudor Britain: 'Darnley' portrait | url = http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/making-art-in-tudor-britain/case-studies/the-queens-likeness-portraits-of-elizabeth-i.php#darnleyportrait |year = 2014 | accessdate = 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Virgin Empress of the Seas==

===Return of the Golden Age===
[[File:Elizabeth1England.jpg|thumb|The ''Ermine Portrait'', William Segar, 1585. Elizabeth as ''Pax''.]]
The [[excommunication]] of Elizabeth by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570 led to increased tension with Philip II of Spain, who championed the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as the legitimate heir of his late wife Mary I.  This tension played out over the next decades in the seas of the [[New World]] as well as in Europe, and culminated in the invasion attempt of the [[Spanish Armada]].

It is against this backdrop that the first of a long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas.&lt;ref name="G3"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined [[Protestant]] protector of her people.

Strong points out that there is no trace of this iconography in portraits of Elizabeth prior to 1579, and identifies its source as the conscious image-making of [[John Dee]], whose 1577 ''General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'' encouraged the establishment of a British Empire supported by a strong navy, asserting Elizabeth's claims to imperial status via her supposed descent from [[Brutus of Troy]] and [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's inspiration lies in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'', which was accepted as true history by Elizabethan poets{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and formed the basis of the symbolic history of England.  In this twelfth century [[pseudohistory]], Britain was founded by and named after Brutus, the descendent of [[Aeneas]] who founded Rome.  The Tudors, of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent, are heirs of the most ancient Britons and thus of Aeneas and Brutus.  By uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster following the strife of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the Tudors ushered in a united realm where ''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'' reigned.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spenserian scholar Edwin  Greenlaw states "The descent of the Britons from the Trojans, the linking of Arthur, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth as Britain's greatest monarchs, and the return under Elizabeth of the [[Golden Age]] are all commonplaces of Elizabethan thought."&lt;ref&gt;E[dwin] Greenlaw, ''Studies in Spenser's Historical Allegory,'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1932, quoted in Yates, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of history and Elizabeth's place in it forms the background to the symbolic portraits of the latter half of her reign.

===The Virgin Queen===
[[File:George Gower Elizabeth Sieve Portrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Plimpton Sieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|Plimpton ''Sieve Portrait'']], Gower, 1579]]

A series of ''Sieve Portraits'' copy the ''Darnley'' face pattern and add an allegorical overlay that depicts Elizabeth as [[Tuccia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her chastity by carrying a sieve full of water from the [[Tiber River]] to the [[Temple of Vesta]] without spilling a drop.&lt;ref&gt;See Hearn 1995, p. 85; Strong 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Sieve Portrait'' was painted by [[George Gower]] in 1579, but the most influential image is the 1583 version by [[Quentin Metsys the Younger|Quentin Metsys (or Massys) the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Strong attributed the painting to [[Cornelis Ketel]] in 1969 and again in 1987 (Strong 1987 p. 101), closer examination has revealed that the painting is signed and dated on the base of the globe ''1583. Q. MASSYS | ANT'' (for "of Antwerp"). (See Hearn 1995, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metsys Elizabeth I The Sieve Portrait c1583.jpg|thumb|upright|The Siena ''Sieve Portrait'', Metsys the Younger, 1583]]

In the Metsys version, Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a column and a globe, iconography that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the ''Armada Portrait'' of c. 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 85; Strong 1987 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The medallions on the pillar to the left of the queen illustrate the story  of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and Aeneas, ancestor of Brutus, suggesting that like Aeneas, Elizabeth's destiny is to reject marriage and found an empire.  This painting's patron was likely Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (his [[heraldic badge]] of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to [[François, Duke of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"&gt;Yates, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The virgin Tuccia was familiar to Elizabethan readers from [[Petrarch]]'s "The Triumph of Chastity".  Another symbol from this work is the spotless [[ermine]], wearing a collar of gold studded with topazes.&lt;ref&gt;Yates pp. 115, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol of purity appears in the ''Ermine Portrait'' of 1585, attributed to the [[herald]] [[William Segar]].  The queen bears the olive branch of ''Pax'' (Peace), and the sword of justice rests on the table at her side.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  In combination, these symbols represent not only the personal purity of Elizabeth but the "righteousness and justice of her government."&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions of empire===
{{Main|Armada Portrait}}
[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|The Woburn Abbey version of the ''Armada Portrait'', c. 1588]]
The ''[[Armada Portrait]]'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] panel painting depicting the queen surrounded by symbols of empire against a backdrop representing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

There are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative paintings.  The version at [[Woburn Abbey]], the seat of the [[Duke of Bedford|Dukes of Bedford]], was long accepted as the work of George Gower, who had been appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA"&gt;Strong 1987, ''Gloriana'', p. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A version in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery, London]], which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen, was also formerly attributed to Gower.  A third version, owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, may have been commissioned by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hearn 1995 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This version was heavily overpainted in the later 17th century, which complicates attribution and may account for several differences in details of the costume.  See  Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; Curators now believe that the three extant versions are all the output of different workshops under the direction of unknown English artists.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors3"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of a life-sized portrait of the queen with a horizontal format is "quite unprecedented in her portraiture",&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt; although allegorical portraits in a horizontal format, such as ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' and the ''Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' pre-date the ''Armada Portrait''.
[[File:Elizabeth I Crispin van de Passe 1596.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, printed 1596]]
The queen's hand rests on a globe below the crown of England, "her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Andrew Belsey and [[Catherine Belsey]], "Icons of Divinity: Portraits of Elizabeth I" in Gent and Llewellyen, ''Renaissance Bodies'', pp. 11–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous [[personal device|impresa]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]], Philip II of Spain's father, which represented the [[pillars of Hercules]], gateway to the Atlantic Ocean and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background view on the left, English [[fireship]]s threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the "[[Protestant Wind]]". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;

An engraving by [[Crispijn van de Passe]] (Crispin van de Passe), published in 1596 but showing costume of the 1580s, carries similar iconography.  Elizabeth stands between two columns bearing her arms and the Tudor [[heraldic badge]] of a [[portcullis]].  The columns are surmounted by her emblems of a pelican in her piety and a phoenix, and ships fill the sea behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cult of Elizabeth===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth I ('The Ditchley portrait') by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Ditchley Portrait'', [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], c.1592]]
The various threads of mythology and symbolism that created the iconography of Elizabeth I combined into a tapestry of immense complexity in the years following the defeat of the Spanish Armada.  In poetry, portraiture and pageantry, the queen was celebrated as [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the just virgin, and simultaneously as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love.  Another exaltation of the queen's virgin purity identified her with the moon goddess who holds dominion over the waters.  Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] had begun to use [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and later [[Artemis#Worship of Artemis|Cynthia]] as aliases for the queen in his poetry around 1580, and images of Elizabeth with jewels in the shape of crescent moons or the huntress's arrows begin to appear in portraiture around 1586 and multiply through the remainder of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;  Courtiers wore the image of the Queen to signify their devotion, and had their portraits painted wearing her colours of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ditchley Portrait'' seems to have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], and likely was painted for (or commemorates)  her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The painting is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron.  In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire.  The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete.  Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel in the form of a celestial or [[armillary sphere]] close to her left ear.  Many versions of this painting were made, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, with the allegorical items removed and Elizabeth's features "softened" from the stark realism of her face in the original.  One of these was sent as a [[diplomatic gift]] to the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]].&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 135–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The last sitting and the Mask of Youth===
[[File:Isaac Oliver Elizabeth I of England.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Unfinished miniature, Oliver, c. 1592]]
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard Elizabeth I 1595-1600 v2.jpg|upright|thumb|Recently discovered miniature by Hilliard, 1595–1600]]
Around 1592, the queen also sat to Isaac Oliver, a pupil of Hilliard, who produced an unfinished portrait miniature (left) used as a pattern for [[engraving]]s of the queen.  Only a single finished miniature from this pattern survives, with the queen's features softened, and Strong concludes that this realistic image from life of the aging Elizabeth was not deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1590s, woodcuts and engravings of the queen were created as book illustrations, but in this decade individual prints of the queen first appear, based on the Oliver face pattern.  In 1596, the Privy Council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen which had caused her "great offence" should be sought out and burnt, and Strong suggest that these prints, of which comparatively few survive, may be the offending images.  Strong writes "It must have been exposure to the searching realism of both Gheeraerts and Oliver that provoked the decision to suppress all likenesses of the queen that depicted her as being in any way old and hence subject to mortality."&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, no surviving portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's death in 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was.  Faithful resemblance to the original is only to be found in contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from [[Henry IV of France]], after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, "her teeth are very yellow and unequal […] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." Yet he added, "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal."&lt;ref&gt; De Maisse: a journal of all that was accomplished by Monsieur De Maisse, ambassador in England from King Henri IV to Queen Elizabeth, anno domini 1597, Nonesuch Press, 1931, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the "Mask of Youth", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's Catalogue L07123, ''Important British Paintings 1500–1850'', November 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;

===The coronation portraits===
[[File:Elizabeth I Coronation Miniature.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Hilliard, c.1600]]
Two portraits of Elizabeth in her [[coronation]] robes survive, both dated to 1600 or shortly thereafter. One is a panel portrait in oils (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;) and the other is a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard.  The warrant to the queen's tailor for remodelling Mary I's cloth of gold coronation robes for Elizabeth survives, and costume historian [[Janet Arnold]]'s study points out that the paintings accurately reflect the written records, although the jewels differ in the two paintings,&lt;ref name="Coro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1978&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting two different sources, one possibly a miniature by Levina Teerlinc. It is not known why, and for whom, these portraits were created; at or just after the end of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rainbow Portrait===
[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Rainbow Porait'', c. 1600–02, attrib. Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]]
Attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Roy C. ''Gloriana: The Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I''. Germany: Thames and Hudson, 1987. pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most heavily symbolic portrait of the queen is the ''Rainbow Portrait'' at [[Hatfield House]]. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties.  In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a [[masque]], in a linen bodice [[embroidery|embroidered]] with spring flowers and a mantle draped over one shoulder, her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;  She wears symbols out of the popular [[emblem book]]s, including the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, and the celestial [[armillary sphere]], and carries a rainbow with the motto ''non sine sol iris'' ("no rainbow without the sun").  Strong suggests that the complex "programme" for this image may be the work of the poet [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], whose ''Hymns to Astraea'' honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a "shrine to Astraea" featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the "last great festival of the reign".&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cult"&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and coins==

[[File:Bishops Bible Elizabeth I 1569.jpg|upright|thumb|Coloured title page of the ''Bishops' Bible'', 1569, [[British Museum]].]]
Prior to the wide dissemination of prints of the queen in the 1590s, the common people of Elizabeth's England would be most familiar with her image on the [[coin]]age.  In December 1560, a systematic recoinage of the debased money then in circulation was begun. The main early effort was the issuance of [[sterling silver]] [[shilling]]s and [[Groat (coin)|groats]], but new coins were issued in both silver and gold.  This restoration of the currency was one of the three principal achievements noted on Elizabeth's tomb, illustrating the value of stable currency to her contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Later coinage represented the queen in iconic fashion, with the traditional accompaniments of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] heraldic badges including the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]].

Books provided another widely available source of images of Elizabeth.  Her portrait appeared on the title page of the ''[[Bishops' Bible]]'', the standard Bible of the [[Church of England]], issued in 1568 and revised in 1572.  In various editions, Elizabeth is depicted with her orb and sceptre accompanied by female [[personification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Reading" the portraits==
[[File:Elizabeth I Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]
It may be impossible for modern viewers to see the hundreds of images of Elizabeth as her subjects, courtiers, and rivals saw them.  The portraits are steeped in classical mythology and the [[Renaissance]] understanding of English history and destiny, filtered by [[allusion]]s to [[Petrarch]]'s [[sonnet]]s and, late in the reign, to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.  Dame [[Frances Yates]] points out that the most complexly symbolic portraits may all commemorate specific events or have been designed as part of elaborate themed entertainments.&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"/&gt; The most familiar images of Elizabeth—the ''Armada'', ''Ditchley'', and ''Rainbow'' portraits—are all associated with unique events in this way.  To the extent that the contexts of other portraits have been lost to scholars, so too the keys to understanding these remarkable images as the Elizabethans understood them may be lost in time.  Even those portraits that are not overtly allegorical may be full of meaning to a discerning eye. Elizabethan courtiers familiar with the [[language of flowers]] and the Italian emblem books could have read stories in the blooms the queen carried, the embroidery on her clothes, and the design of her jewels.

According to [[Roy Strong]], &lt;blockquote&gt;Fear of the wrong use and perception of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of the essence of what they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central to the understanding of the Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Possibilianism''' is a philosophy which rejects both the diverse claims of traditional  [[theism]] and the positions of certainty in [[strong atheism]] in favor of a middle, exploratory ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-beyond-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html Beyond God and atheism: Why I am a possibilian], David Eagleman, ''New Scientist'', Sep 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onpointradio.org/2009/02/envisioning-the-afterlife Envisioning the Afterlife],  interview with David Eagleman on NPR's ''[[On Point]]'', Feb 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nytimesPaperCuts"&gt;[http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/stray-questions-for-david-eagleman Stray questions for David Eagleman], ''[[New York Times]]''  Paper Cuts, July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpbs.org/news/2009/mar/16/neuroscientist-imagines-40-different-versions-of/ Neuroscientist Imagines 40 Different Versions of the Afterlife], [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]] interview with David Eagleman, Mar 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TexasObserver"&gt;[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/the-soul-seeker The Soul Seeker: A neuroscientist's search for the human essence], ''[[Texas Observer]]'' cover story, June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was invented by Robbie Parrish,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090223184309/http://www.possibilian.com/ history]&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] who defined the term in relation to his book of fiction ''[[Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives]]''.&lt;ref name="TOTN"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=100778241 NPR Talk of the Nation: Interview with David Eagleman], Feb 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  
==History ==
Asked whether he was an atheist or a religious person on a [[National Public Radio]] interview in February 2009, Eagleman  replied "I call myself a Possibilian: I'm open to...ideas that we don't have any  way of testing right now."&lt;ref name="TOTN" /&gt;  In a subsequent interview with the ''New York Times'', Eagleman expanded on the definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our ignorance of the cosmos is too vast to commit to atheism, and yet we know too much to commit to a  particular religion. A third position, [[agnosticism]], is often an uninteresting stance in which a person  simply questions whether his traditional religious story (say, a man with a beard on a cloud) is true  or not true. But with Possibilianism I'm hoping to define a new position — one that emphasizes the  exploration of new, unconsidered possibilities. Possibilianism is comfortable holding multiple ideas  in mind; it is not interested in committing to any particular story." &lt;ref name= "nytimesPaperCuts"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of Eagleman—entitled "The Possibilian"—Burkhard Bilger wrote:&lt;ref name="newyorker2011"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/25/110425fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all The Possibilian: David Eagleman and the Mysteries of the Brain], ''The New Yorker'', Apr 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Science had taught him to be skeptical of cosmic certainties, [Eagleman] told me. From the unfathomed complexity of brain tissue—"essentially an alien computational material"—to the mystery of [[dark matter]], we know too little about our own minds and the universe around us to insist on strict atheism, he said. "And we know far too much to commit to a particular religious story." Why not revel in the alternatives? Why not imagine ourselves, as he did in ''Sum'', as bits of networked hardware in a cosmic program, or as particles of some celestial organism, or any of a thousand other possibilities, and then test those ideas against the available evidence? "Part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple [[hypotheses]] in mind at the same time," he said. "As [[Voltaire]] said, uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An adherent of possibilianism is called a '''possibilian'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trashotron.com/agony/news/2009/03-09-09-podcast.htm#podcast031309 "I'm a possibilian"], Rick Kleffel's ''The Agony Column'', Mar 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-henley/are-you-surrounded-with-a_b_170583.html Are you  surrounded with authentic communities?], [[The Huffington Post]], 1 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;[http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/09/10/2063070.aspx?p=1 Choose your afterlife],  [[MSNBC.com]], Sept 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibilian perspective is distinguished from [[agnosticism]] in its active exploration of novel possibilities and its emphasis on the necessity of holding multiple positions at once if there is no available data to privilege one over the others.&lt;ref name="TexasObserver" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/09/school-of-life-possibilianism-david-eagleman Ideas for modern living: uncertainty]. ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK). 9 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eagleman has emphasized that possibilianism reflects the scientific temperament of creativity and intellectual humility in the face of "the known unknowns."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LENqnjZGX0A Why I am a Possibilian], TEDx talk by David Eagleman, Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, F. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6266014.html# Writing about what comes next].  ''Houston Chronicle''. 16 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' and [[MSNBC]], the possibilian concept—including various spellings (e.g. "possibillion") and modifications (e.g. "possibilitarian")—has become popular on the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN-eagleman_0616gd.ART0.State.Edition1.50ba880.html Houston author stunned by buzz over 'possibilian'  theory], ''Dallas Morning News'', June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 2009, ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'' Magazine wrote: "[[Googling]] 'possibilian', the position Eagleman invented to explain his belief system, throws up the beginnings of a worldwide movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/article/21958 Choose (after)life]. ''The List Magazine'', Issue 643, 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles about possibilianism have appeared in major news outlets around the globe—for example, in the ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' of [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/LifeStyle/Religion/-/689744/839870/-/jvslvu/-/index.html You could be a Possibilian...], ''The Daily Monitor'', Uganda. Jan 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economic Times of India]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Beyond-good-and-bad/articleshow/6230800.cms Beyond Good and Bad], ''Economic Times of India'', July 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-beyond-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the ''New Statesman'', the atheist author [[Philip Pullman]] declared himself a possibilian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2011/06/afghanistan-pullman-means Philip Pullman on what he owes to the Church of England], ''New Statesman'', 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]]'' founding editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] in an interview in the ''LA Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/13/opinion/la-oe-morrison-kelly-20110813-2 Patt Morrison Asks: The Possibilian, Kevin Kelly], 13 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 2011, "close to a thousand [[Facebook]] members had switched their [[religious affiliation]] to Possibilianism."&lt;ref name="newyorker2011" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] (a [[new atheist]]) has attacked possibilianism as "intellectually dishonest", and its description of strict atheism as a straw man. Harris writes that the position Eagleman espouses "is, simply, atheism."  Harris calls on Eagleman "to admit that “possibilianism,” this middle position of yours, is just a piece of performance art, rather than a serious thesis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/whither-eagleman/ Whither Eagleman?], Sam Harris, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, Eagleman stated that "[Harris'] braggadocio appears to be emblematic of the neo-atheist posture, and confirms why I don't feel completely at home in that camp."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eagleman.com/blog/item/43-why-i-am-a-possibilian Eagleman Blog: Why I am a possibilian], David Eagleman, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Journalist Steve Volk in the Huffington Post suggested that Harris and Eagleman should be "new allies": "If we're going to get beyond the typical exchanges between new atheists and the religious, I'd argue that it's through figures like Eagleman and Harris that we will find the most productive path: men who are eager to use science while demonstrating a capacity to consider ideas from other areas of human experience and systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-volk/culture-wars-allies_b_935187.html New Allies In The Theist/Atheist Debate], Steve Volk, Huffington Post, 8/25/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern Marketing''' is a term derived from [[postmodern]] philosophical movements where there are cultural tendencies of inherent suspicion towards a global cultural narrative or meta-narrative.  Postmodern marketing takes this same philosophical perspective and applies it to the way [[advertising]] initiatives are handled in the current post-World War II era.  Postmodern marketing is approaching or has passed through a new era in [[advertising]], [[Brand management|branding]], and strategic [[brand]] thinking.&lt;ref name="dmarson-pg226"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Well Encyclopedia of Management |last=Marson |first=David J. |year=2011 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=Malden, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-631-23317-6 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern marketing is inherently focused on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no-longer applied or implemented on behalf of branded communications.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Postmodern Marketing?",|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the technique requires marketers to remove "new aged adlandia" trends and developments to focus on how the consumer prefers to be messaged to.

As a result, the ad aged "art and science" debate around [[creativity|creative]], [[Advertising#Media|media]], [[marketing]] and [[Brand management|branding]] are put to an end.  With a postmodern marketing approach a one-to-one communication is created between real humans, controlling real mouses, real computers, real keyboards and real [[mobile telephones]].

== Origins ==
The development of postmodern marketing is built on the foundations of modern marketing (with analysis, planning, implementation and control deeply rooted in its process).&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   Postmodern marketing however, acts more of a collection of approaches in the need to stay nimble, reactive and able to engage and shift with consumers from a non-definitive point of view.  Postmodern marketing saw great acceptance in the early 1990s with the emerging developments of the [[Splinternet]] and marketers realization that "traditional" strategic practices like Porters five forces, the Wheel of Retailing, and the Boston Matrix had become outdated and not able to keep up with or report on consumer media habits, creative tone, and umbrella [[Brand management|branding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   As a result, postmodern marketing was born.

== Three Categories of Postmodern Marketing ==
Although the exact origins of the term is unknown, scholarly reports date the defining of the movement to the early 1990s by the "European Journal of Marketing" author Stephen Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-staff/fast-company-blog/post-modern-marketing |title=Post-Modern Marketing |publisher=FastCompany.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his findings, postmodern marketing is made up of three distinct categories (1) the idea of change, new, and complex, (2) sub-discipline of consumer research, and (3) marketing practices and research methodologies.   Furthermore, as Brown implies, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with "artistic" attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

=== The Idea of Change, New and Complex ===

The idea of change is a deeply rooted philosophy when studying postmodern marketing.  When planning and strategizing within the "new now" or the "new new now" of media, technical services and creative styling a practitioner within the space must be comfortable with new and more complex systems and created worlds, platform and messaging structures.  Fundamentally grounded on dramatic political and economic pressures the changing landscape illustrated the need to be nimble, direct and personalized communication and a high concern for [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="styler"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unspeakable: Discourse, Dialogue, and Rhetoric in the Postmodern World (Rhetoric of Human Sciences) |last=Tyler |first=Stephen J. |year=1987 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Pr |location= Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-11274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-discipline of Consumer Research ===

To adjust with shifts in consumer consumption habits, postmodern [[marketing]] has created new disciplines to better sample, survey and poll target [[consumer group]] to better align with habit, preference and beliefs.  Many call this shift a "naturalistic" or interpretive" approach,  which mainly emerged from the control of non-renewable resources.

=== Marketing Practices and Research Methodologies ===

Outcomes of redefined consumer research studies are newly defined approaches to marketing and media disciplines.  Although some of these disciplines may be out dated, they illustrate core differences between postmodern marketing and modern marketing methodologies.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

These approaches to marketing suggest that the role of a [[brand manager]], digital agency, creative, [[media planner]], account director, etc. is only defined by the [[company culture|company's culture]] that they in.  Hence, a postmodern marketer is one who approaches marketing and advertising campaigns with a "thinker marker" mentality.  Where they pull in and emphasize the need for creative relevance, companion [[Advertising#Media|media]], collateral activation, social engagement, and most importantly have the means to pull it all together.  Many believe that a postmodern marketing approach creates greater efficiencies, order, opportunity and a chance to gain real world insights from the perspective of the consumer.  As a result, postmodern [[marketing]] like postmodernality stands as a transitory phase in 21st centuryvertising and has ushered in an era of styles and nimble techniques.

== Myths ==
Postmodern marketing is not the same as "non-traditional" or [[digital marketing]]. It is instead made up only of new aged media engagements brought about by the developments like that of the iPad.

Social media belongs to the young.  According to Sean Carton writer of ClickZ, the idea of social media belonging to only the young is, "Baloney".  With the accelerated growth of account activation amongst the 55+ age cohort according to leading marketing research firms like [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], [[eMarketer]], [[comScore]] and [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the idea of social media belonging to only the young Republicans is an inaccurate statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/1709224/-post-modern-marketing-myths-busted |title=Postmodern Marketing Myths: Busted |publisher=ClickZ.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==
According to many scholastic journals, postmodern marketing hinges on and has aided to the development of many changes to the current marketing model.  Some of the more renowned conditions that postmodern marketing is known to influence and disrupt are :&lt;ref name="ffuat-pg40"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Marketing In  Postmodern World",|last=Fuat |first=Firat |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 29 Iss: 1|pages=40–56 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hyper reality:''' Relating to simulations or simulated experiences.  Tourist attractions, amusement parks and "subculture" vacation destinations are known for their ability in creating hyper-real "immersive worlds".
* '''Fragmentation:''' Adheres to many marketing disciplines.  These being media space, consumer attention, consumption habits, and communication/messaging strategies.
* '''Reversals of production and consumption:''' A condition that occurs when the roles of consumer and marketer change.  This is when consumers become "brand ambassadors" for a company and voice concern, opinion and align their beliefs with that of the brand through a number of traditional and non-traditional media channels.
* '''Decentering of the subject:''' Occurs when a brand personifies the product or service being marketed.  As a result, the promoted item become a "Hero" or a new-age savior.
* '''Paradoxical juxtaposition:''' The ultimate state of postmodern marketing.  This condition allows consumers and brand managers to act in the moment and adjust to changing landscapes, tone, pressure, and emotional cues.  As a result, they are able to represent a different self-image and avoid moments of conformity to single, set brand guidelines, perceived reputations and roles.
* '''Loss of commitment:'''  An outcome of many postmodern marketing experiences can result in loss of commitment amongst brand ambassadors and loyalists.  This is usually driven from the inability for brand managers to adhere to or recreate the level of consumer engagement needed retain the same level of consumer interest and interaction.

'''Service-learning''' is an educational approach that combines learning objectives with community service in order to provide a pragmatic, progressive learning experience while meeting societal needs.

Service-learning involves students in service projects to apply classroom learning for local agencies that exist to effect positive change in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=Timothy D. |author2=Bradley J. Fisher|title=The Effectiveness of Service-Learning: It's not always what you think|journal=Journal of Experiential Education|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=208–224|doi=10.5193/JEE33.3.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Youth Leadership Council]] defines service learning as "a philosophy, pedagogy, and model for community development that is used as an instructional strategy to meet learning goals and/or content standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=K–12 Service-Learning Standards for Quality Practice|publisher=National Youth Leadership Council|url=http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111201324/http://www.nylc.org/sites/nylc.org/files/files/Standards_Oct2009-web.pdf|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Barbara Jacoby defines service-learning as "a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities for reflection designed to achieve desired learning outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacoby|first1=Barbara|title=Service-Learning in Higher Education: Concepts and Practices|date=1996|isbn=978-0787902919|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
As defined by Robert Sigmon, 1994:
* Service-LEARNING: Learning goals primary; service outcomes secondary.
* SERVICE-Learning: Service outcomes primary; learning goals secondary.
* service learning: Service and learning goals completely separate.
* SERVICE-LEARNING: Service and learning goals of equal weight and each enhances the other for all participants.

===Examples of service-learning typologies===

'''Service-learning''', as defined by Robert Sigmon, "occurs when there is a balance between learning goals and service outcomes."&lt;ref name=Furco&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furco|first1=Andrew|title="Service-Learning": A Balanced Approach to Experiential Education|journal=The INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL for GLOBAL and DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION RESEARCH|date=October 2011|issue=0|pages=71–76|url=http://educacio-cp89.webjoomla.es/wp-content/uploads/03-Furco-1-English.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} As follows, there are various methods of hands-on learning that fall into this category, these include:
* [[Volunteering|Volunteerism]]: Volunteerism is acts of service performed out of free will without expectation of recompense and is generally altruistic in nature; the main beneficiaries (at least in a visible sense) are generally those served by the student.
* [[Community service|Community Service]]: Community service is quite similar to volunteerism, the main difference being that it is said to "involve more structure and student commitment than do volunteer programs."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|74}}
* [[Internship]]: Internships can provide students with experience in various fields of work; however, unlike volunteerism and community service, students gain a more measurable benefit from this aspect of service learning.
* Field Education: Field education, like internships, is generally more materially beneficial to the student. Field education involves programs that, "provide students with co‐curricular service opportunities that are related, but not fully integrated, with their formal academic studies."&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt;{{rp|75}}

The purpose of service learning is, in essence, to, "equally benefit the provider and the recipient of the service as well as to ensure equal focus on both the service being provided and the learning that is occurring." Volunteerism, community service, internships, and field education all exemplify, in some way or another, the core value of service learning, as all of them benefit the student as well as the one they served to an equal degree, the only difference being how material the benefit is. These methods also tend to focus on ensuring that the student not only serves, but learns something, whether it is interpersonal skills, work experience in their future field,&lt;ref name=Furco/&gt; or a change in how they view themselves and others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight E.|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|date=23 April 1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|edition=1st|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-470-90746-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

==History==
In ''Service-learning: History, Theory, and Issues'', Bruce W. Speck and Sherry Lee Hoppe say that [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] writings on the active nature of understanding and the benefits of and conditions for participatory democracy "provide an early theoretical foundation for a pedagogy in which students cooperatively engage actual social problems". In ''Building partnerships for service-learning'', Barbara Jacoby writes that Service-learning "is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Donald Schon]], and [[David Kolb]], who believe that we learn through combinations of action and reflection."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url =https://www.nl.edu/media/nlu/downloadable/studentservices/civicengagement/chapter-1.pdf | title =Service-Learning Faculty Manual | last1 =Lukenchuk | first1 =Antonina | last2 =Jagla | first2 =Virginia | last3 =Eigel | first3 =Matthew | publisher =National Louis University | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Robert Sigmon called for a more precise definition in ''Service-Learning: Three Principles'', in which he said the term, which was relatively new, was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sigmon | first = Robert | date = Spring 1979 | title = Service-Learning: Three Principles | url = http://critical.tamucc.edu/~wiki/uploads/AWebb/sl3p.pdf | language = English | journal = Synergist | pages = 9–11 | access-date = November 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sigmon wrote that, in the late 1960s, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) popularized a service-learning internship model, that defined service-learning as "the integration of the accomplishment of a public task with conscious educational growth."&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===In American education===
In 1992 Maryland adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduation Requirements|url=http://archives.marylandpublicschools.org/msde/programs/servicelearning/docs/requirements.htm|website=Maryland Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the District of Columbia also adopted such requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCPS Community Service Guide 2011–2012|url=http://cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcps/publication/attachments/DCPS%20Community%20Service%20Guide%20SY11-12%20FINAL.pdf|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other states have allowed credit toward graduation for service-learning/community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquest3RTE?Rep=SL1301 | title =High School Graduation Requirement or Credit toward Graduation — Service-Learning/Community Service | date =January 2014 | publisher =Education Commission of the States (ECS) | access-date =November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
Janet Eyler outlines the different ways student learn through service-learning in the book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?''.  First, there is interpersonal learning, in which students re-evaluate personal values and motivations by channeling a passionate interest to service-learning projects, as well as build a connection and commitment to the community.  The second form is academic material that is taught through practical application and reflective instruction, so that it may be practiced outside classrooms and test-taking. Janet Eyler explains, "it is the product of continuous challenge to old conceptions and reflection on new ways to organize information and use the new material."  Thirdly is cognitive development where students are challenged to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a context that provides additional information and experience for student evaluation, because service-learning deals with numerous problems in complex situations.  The fourth form is transformation within the students, which "is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new direction—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines."  Finally, service-learning focuses on effective citizenship and behavioral issues, and this helps the students better understand social issues relevant to their own community.  Learning in all these ways makes service-learning effective to those serving as well as those being served, for "learning begins with the impact of service-learning on the personal and interpersonal development of the students."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

According to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, there are numerous benefits to the service-learning approach. It provides experiential learning that connects personal and interpersonal development with cognitive and academic advancement,  providing opportunities for personal connections and ultimately transformation. Those serving may encounter certain social problems for the first time, thus transforming their view on the world. Beyond that, students may be transformed in the way of developing better problem-solving skills to address those problems about which they now know. A service-learning experience may be the catalyst in the life of a student to dive into the complexities of the social issues they have encountered and to seek to develop innovative solutions.

Service learning combines both [[experiential learning]] and [[community service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perez, Shivaun|title=Assessing Service Learning Using Pragmatic Principles of Education: A Texas Charter School Case Study|year=2000|journal=Applied Research Projects|series=Paper 76|publisher=Texas State University|url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for students to receive college credit for service-learning courses, a substantial amount of academic learning needs to accompany the service.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Janet Eyler outlines several impacts of learning that she believes evolves from service-learning. The first impact is Personal Connections.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} When a person is passionate about a certain topic or cause, they will more likely want to make a difference by trying to mend the area with which they are passionate about.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Lifelong learners develop from students who are personally connected with their passion. Secondly, the usefulness of service-learning, according to Eyler, can impact a student for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} Eyler points that learning the material for a test or exam in a classroom is one thing, but actually pulling that knowledge out and using it in new circumstances or in problems that arise in everyday life is another thing. Students have the chance to practice what they learn in the classroom by encountering life problems and have a chance to develop skill in how to develop solutions for the problems they face. The development of learning is the third impact that Eyler explains.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}} She writes that much of the knowledge that students have is not self-consumed, but rather developed from training obtained from the classroom and from daily life. Any thought or active development attained during service is more liable to impact the student, and the students' surroundings.  The fourth impact that Eyler explains is the transformational aspect of service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Students who participate in service are can be likely to develop different ways of thinking and approaching life. It may be a service-learning course that impacts the students' frame of thinking, while transforming the community as well. Finally, the fifth impact of learning is finding citizenship in our communities.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|18–19}} While the students are serving and impacting the community, they are very likely to find their role in society. Students can realize that they can make a difference and do have a part in their community. This realization can lead to citizenship, and active and acknowledged place in community. These five by-products of learning, as Janet Eyler outlines, are important to the progression of learning in service-learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

=== Factors ===
According to Eyler and Giles Jr., who conducted nationwide studies on service-learning, factors which influence its impact on students include placement quality, duration, and reflection.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Placement quality ====
According to Eyler and Giles, "''Placement quality'' refers to the extent that students in their community placements are challenged, are active rather than observers, do a variety of tasks, feel that they are making a positive contribution, have important levels of responsibility, and receive input and appreciation from supervisors in the field."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|33}} According to their research, placement quality has measurable effects on such things as "personal development outcomes," "increased leadership and communication skill," and connection to community, faculty, and other students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|54–56}}

==== Duration ====
In ''The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning,'' Eyler and Giles state: "a program or a sequence of experiences needs to be of a long enough duration to have a developmental impact."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning|last=Eyler|first=Janet|last2=Giles Jr.|first2=Dwight|work=Service-Learning: Applications From the Research|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Waterman|editor-first=Alan S.|location=New York, NY|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is expanded upon by Alexander W. Astin and Linda J. Sax. In their opinion, "the amount of time devoted to providing service carries additional benefits beyond those benefits associated with the type of service performed, especially in the areas of civic responsibility and life skill development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Astin|first=Alexander W.|last2=Sax|first2=Linda J.|date=1998|title=How Undergraduates are Affected by Service Participation|url=|journal=Journal of College Student Development|pages=260|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But how much time is enough? According to J. Beth Mabry, "students should spend at least fifteen to nineteen hours in their service activities to have adequate exposure to the people and issues their service addresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mabry|first=J. Beth|date=1998|title=Pedagogical Variations in Service-Learning and Student Outcomes|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service-Learning|page=41|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reflection ====
An essential feature of service-learning programs, reflection is a period of critical thinking performed by the student. For many advocates of the pedagogy, reflection may symbolize the learning that occurs in the student. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles provide an example of this opinion in their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' when they state: "learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection, not simply through being able to recount what has been learned through reading and lecture."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; Also, the National Service Learning Clearinghouse considers reflection to be a "core component" of service-learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114232334/http://www.servicelearning.org/instant_info/fact_sheets/he_facts/he_reflection/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 14, 2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some higher education programs require a reflection component in their service-learning classes. The University of Minnesota is one such institution that includes required reflection activities with its service learning classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicelearning.umn.edu/info/reflection.html|title=Reflection in service-learning classes|publisher=Center for Community-Engaged Learning|accessdate=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflection may be done individually or as a group activity. Wartburg College in Indiana published a list of reflection activity suggestions on their website. These included various types of journaling, brainstorming as a group, using quotes, writing essays and papers, structured class discussions, and class presentations among other ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Service-Learning Reflection Activities | publisher=Wartburg College | accessdate=June 2, 2016 | author=Robin R. Jones | url=http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905080645/http://www.wartburg.edu/cce/cce/assessment%20and%20reflection/SL-Reflection%20Activities.pdf | archivedate=September 5, 2012 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective service-learning programs also include required written reflection. Not only does writing permanently record a student's service-learning experience, but it also provides a helpful tool for continued reflection long after the program has been completed. Written reflection assignments also require students to stop, think, and articulate their learning. This evaluation is of incredible value to students.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|171–177}}

==Service==
High quality placements are a key to the success of a service-learning program. This requires the service learning establishment to have a broad network of connections within the community. Students need to have a positive connection with the establishment they're serving in order to maximize their learning.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|last2=Giles|first2=Dwight E.|year=2007|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=Jossey-Bass|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167–170}}

Diversity is also a component of a successful service-learning program. By working with people of different ethnicities, lifestyles, and socioeconomic statuses, a student's learning and tolerance will increase. By serving in a diverse [[learning environment]], student are more likely to reduce stereotypes and increase their cultural appreciation. This can help a student learn how to more effectively serve a broader array of people.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|177–178}}

The Service in Service Learning takes knowledge outside the classroom into the real world with real people and situations.&amp;nbsp; In his book ''Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty'', Muhammad Yunus states that "If a university is a repository for knowledge, then some of this knowledge should spill over to the neighboring community. A university must not be an island where academics reach out to higher and higher levels of knowledge without sharing any of their findings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to The Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=1-58648-198-3|location=United States of America|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service brings community together as a whole, towards a common goal or purpose. Service is about what is for someone else. The action of service in and among the community, provides chances for sociocultural norms and prejudices to be removed. While some have questioned the positive effect and collective interest of the ''service'' side of service-learning, among those who perform the services, it has been made known that many would say otherwise.

==Effects==
Based upon various studies, students who participate in service-learning courses or projects seem to encounter a multitude of benefits. The book ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' discusses the effects of service learning on students, as well service learning in general.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

===Effects on the student===

In addition to interpersonal skills students have also reported developing personal leadership skills.&lt;ref name="UCLA - Service-Learning"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexander W. Astin|author2=Lori J. Vogelgesang|author3=Elaine K. Ikeda|author4=Jennifer A. Yee|title=How Service Learning Affects Students|url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&amp;context=slcehighered|website=Digital Commons|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit seen is that it can also develop a sense of meaning and purpose in their academics.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt; 

Though one might not immediately think of serving others as affecting oneself, studies have found that "coming into contact with people whose life experiences and assumptions about the world are different calls one's own world into question."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Not only does the service experience move one to examine his own life, but it also allows him to produce a better version of himself. In their book, ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. identify five key personal growth outcomes of service-learning: self-knowledge, spiritual growth, the reward of helping others, career benefits and careers in service, and changes in personal efficacy.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35–39}} As one goes out into the community with the intent of reaching out to those within it, this broader social context causes one to see himself more clearly.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Being involved in the educational process of service-learning also strengthens one's critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which is vital to facing modern-day dilemmas. This will transform a person's prior way of thinking, for critical thinking stimulates people to question assumptions and to "color outside the lines". According to Eyler and Giles Jr., "Transformative thinking is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new directions—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

It is in this way that service-learning motivates individuals to become better citizens of their communities. Many of those interested in reforming higher education have found that this experiential pedagogy helps to "cultivate civic and social responsibility as part of education for citizenship".&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|12}} As individuals acquire knowledge about serving those around them, they can apply that knowledge to community problems, thus being able to make a greater difference in the world. People who realize their responsibility to their community will naturally develop into more productive members of society. 

Service-learning begins in the heart and mind of the individual; he must understand himself before he can attempt to understand others. This will prompt him to develop personal connections with those whom he is serving, for it is within community involvement where one's own understanding and knowledge are transformed.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Researchers have found that these personal and interpersonal gains from engaging in service-learning classes where higher when the programs were of better quality. The biggest predictor of increased learning in communication skills was the high placement quality that the students were put into, allowing them to develop and "hone" their skills.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Many experience interpersonal development through the service learning process. According to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', among the students in their survey, "40 percent reported that learning to work with others was among the most important things they learned from service-learning, and 81 percent indicated that it was the most or very important." Learning to work with others is crucial for job placement in our world today. Another effect this has on the students is that they are more apt to learn how to lead. By working with others, the students are given opportunities to be more responsible and take initiative. Service-learning also encourages connection within the community. Truly, many learned how to listen to the voice of their communities. Not only that, but it helps form friendships and find other like-minded individuals who are involved with service learning. Above all it helps students to feel as though they are making a difference and matter to their communities. It was also found that quantity and quality of reflective discussion was linked to the outcome of feeling a closeness among the community and other students. An even more powerful outcome was the creation of a bond between a student and faculty member. In most classroom settings there's little room for a deep relationship between the student and teacher, while in service-learning often student and teacher will work alongside each other and develop a more lasting bond. As stated in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', "Service participants in their assessment of Learn and Serve America were more likely than their peers to spend at least an hour a week interacting with a faculty member." Service-learning has a tremendous impact on students and how they learn, but also how they interact with others.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999"/&gt;{{rp|45–52}}

===Diversity awareness===

Service-learning offers an opportunity for students to experience different cultures, which in turn reduces many negative and unnecessary stereotypes derived by inexperienced students. The appreciation of different cultures in service-learning happens because of the interaction that often occurs while completing a service. A survey on students who participated in service-learning finds that, "63 percent reported interacting with those receiving services at least fairly often, 60 percent reported frequent interaction with other volunteers, 51 percent felt that professionals at the placement site often took an interest in them, and 57 percent reported that they had frequent chances to work with people from ethnic groups other than their own."&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

One of the goals of service-learning is positive interactions.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

People often only distinguish the differences between other cultures and communities and their own. These perceived differences often influence the decisions made when interacting with people of other cultures. Service-learning provides the opportunity for students to not only appreciate other cultures, but to appreciate their shared humanity.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

==Effects on community partners==
Service learning programs have developed rapidly within the last 30 years. From 1995–1997, 458 universities received grants from the Corporation for National Service's Learn and Serve Higher Education (LASHE) which enabled 3,000 new service-learning courses to be developed to the benefit of more than 60 students per course.&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;

Much of the research on the effects of service-learning is focused on what students learn through their service to the community; fewer studies have been conducted on the impact of service-learning on the communities where the students serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tryon|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Stoecker|first2=Randy|title=The Unheard Voices: Community Organizations and Service-Learning|journal=Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement|date=September 2008|volume=12|issue=3|url=http://openjournals.libs.uga.edu/index.php/jheoe/article/view/99/87|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}  Several studies that have been done on this topic measure the impact of service-learning on the community organizations with which college students volunteer, seeking to understand the organizations' perspectives on service-learning.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandy|first1=Marie|last2=Holland|first2=Barbara A.|title=Different Worlds and Common Ground: Community Partner Perspectives on Campus-Community Partnerships|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=Fall 2006|volume=13|issue=1|pages=30–43|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0013.103/--different-worlds-and-common-ground-community-partner?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=Andrea|last2=Ward|first2=Kelly|title=Campus and Community Partnerships: Assessing Impacts and Strengthening Connections|journal=Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning|date=1999|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjcsl/3239521.0006.103/--campus-and-community-partnerships-assessing-impacts?view=image|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

One positive impact of service-learning on these organizations is the presence of more volunteers, which enables the organizations to accomplish more&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|35–36}} and to serve more clients.&lt;ref name=Perla&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrientos|first1=Perla|title=Community Service Learning and its Impact on Community Agencies: An Assessment Study|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~icce/downloads/pdf/CSL%20Report%20for%20Publishing_3-25-10.pdf|website=www.sfsu.edu|publisher=San Francisco State University|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}  Students can use specific skills they possess to benefit the organization,&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|49}} and can be a source of new ideas, energy, and enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Through partnering with a college or university, the organization can gain access to new knowledge and opportunities to connect with other organizations that have partnered with the same school.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|36}}

==In Native American communities==
Service-learning has been applied across a host of cultural settings, including numerous Native American communities. Guffey (1997) notes credible service learning begins with tribal ways of knowing and value systems, which is to say that outsiders should not impose service learning projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416179|title=Learning with the Community: Concepts and Models for Service-Learning in Teacher Education. AAHE's Series on Service-Learning in the Disciplines.|author1=Erickson, Joseph A.|author2=Anderson, Jeffrey B.|date=30 November 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, tribal communities should devise projects that reflect needs unique to the community being served. This parallels Matthew Fletcher's (2010) assertion that tribes, and other historically marginalized communities, should unique develop educational programs, as opposed to merely adopting Westernized forms of education. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Indian-Education-Counternarratives-Struggle/dp/0415957354|title=American Indian Education: Counternarratives in Racism, Struggle, and the Law|first=search|last=results|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Routledge|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, service learning provides a pedagogical framework for tribes to address community needs. One such example is provided by Sykes, Pendley, and Deacon (2017) who provide a qualitative case study of a tribally-initiated service learning project embedded within a partnership at a research university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/ijcre/article/view/5334|title=Transformative learning, tribal membership and cultural restoration: A case study of an embedded Native American service-learning project at a research university|first1=Brent E.|last1=Sykes|first2=Joy|last2=Pendley|first3=Zermarie|last3=Deacon|date=22 June 2017|publisher=|journal=Gateways: International Journal of Community Research and Engagement|volume=10|pages=204–28|via=epress.lib.uts.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case is unique in that it recounts how service learning students (who were also tribal members) came to collectively understand their responsibilities of citizenship through service. Moreover, tribal elders came to appreciate the importance of young citizens in maintaining and growing tribal culture. Thus, service learning can also be a means to explore cultural identity.

==Critiques==
There are numerous critiques of service-learning. In 1979, Robert Sigmon acknowledged criticisms that called service-learning, "a utopian vision" and "too demanding and impractical". He called for research into outcomes related to service-learning.&lt;ref name=Sigmon1979/&gt;{{rp|11}} Towson University Professor John Egger, writing in the Spring 2008 issue of the journal ''Academic Questions'', argued that service learning does not really teach useful skills or develop cultural knowledge. Instead, Egger maintained, service learning mainly involves the inculcation of communitarian political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ncsce.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NoToServiceLearning_000.pdf|first=John|last=Egger|title= No Service to Learning: 'Service-Learning' Reappraised|journal=Academic Questions|volume=21|pages=183–194|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12129-008-9057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulane Professor [[Carl L. Bankston]] III has described his own university's policy of mandating service learning as the imposition of intellectual conformity by the university administration on both students and faculty. According to Bankston, by identifying specific types of civic engagement as worthy community service, the university was prescribing social and political perspectives. He argued that this was inconsistent with the idea that individuals in a pluralistic society should choose their own civic commitments and that it was contrary to the ideal of the university as a site for the pursuit of truth through the free exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popecenter.org/commentaries/article.html?id=2537|author=[[Carl L. Bankston]] III|title=Modern Orthodoxies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these organizations face challenges in working with the students.  Communication with faculty is often inconsistent, so organizations do not always understand their roles and the roles of the faculty in students' service projects.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|55–56}}  Some organizations' representatives stated that faculty assigned students projects that were not allowed in their organization.&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|37}}  Often the demographics of students do not match well with the demographics of the clients they serve, which can make it difficult for the students to relate to the clients&lt;ref name=Perla/&gt;{{rp|11}} or create an uncomfortable situation for the clients.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|54–55}}  The academic calendar students follow tends not to work well with the organizations' schedules, since students' volunteering schedules are interrupted for holiday breaks, finals, and other activities.&lt;ref name="Vernon 2014" /&gt;{{rp|33}} Also, the small number of hours students are required to spend volunteering can cause problems for organizations and their clients.  Some organizations require more hours for volunteer training than students are required to volunteer,&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|39}} and making a personal connection with clients only to break it off soon after can be more hurtful than helpful.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Representatives of community organizations where service-learning students volunteer expressed interest in working with colleges and universities to change service-learning programs so that they work more smoothly for the organizations. Their suggestions included establishing more consistent communication between faculty and organizations, creating longer-term partnerships between colleges and community organizations, and ensuring that the students and their projects are matched well with the organizations they serve.&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt;{{rp|56–57}}&lt;ref name="Sandy 2006" /&gt;{{rp|34, 37, 40}}

In ''Downsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its Public'', Matthew A. Crenson and Benjamin Ginsberg question whether service-learning is contributing to privatizing or downsizing citizenship practices. Responding to this, Christopher Koliba wrote that education providers may have the opportunity to change this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Koliba | first= Christopher

=== Comprehensive Action Plan for Service Learning (CAPSL) ===
* CAPSL Identifies four constituencies on which a program for service learning needs to focus its principal activities: institution, faculty, students, and community.
* CAPSL also identifies a sequence of activities (Planning; awareness; prototype; resources; expansion; recognition; monitoring; evaluation; research; institutionalization) to be pursued for each of the four constituencies(institution, faculty, students and community).
* CAPSL provides a heuristic for guiding the development of a service learning program in higher education.
* Advantages of CAPSL: it is general enough that the execution of each cell can be tailored to local conditions.
* Disadvantages of CAPSL: it is not possible to detail how each step can be successfully accomplished to take the sequence of activities from the whole CAPSL model and apply it to any cell in the matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=G. Bringle|author2=Julie A.

===Engineering education===
{{Main article|Service-learning in engineering education}}

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in [[Engineers Without Borders|engineering education]] as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service learning into their curricula and there is now a journal dedicated to service learning in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious aspects===
In ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'', Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. wrote, "Although fewer students chose spiritual growth as an important outcome of service-learning—20 percent selecting it as among the most important things they learned and 46 percent selecting it as very or most important—it was important to many students...Some saw service as a definite opportunity to fulfill their religious commitment."&lt;ref name="Eyler 1999" /&gt;{{rp|36, 37}}

Service-learning has both a service and a learning component. Eyler and Giles Jr. in ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' apply the term service-learning "to programs where the two foci are in balance, and study and action are explicitly integrated.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Eyler and Giles Jr. have found that service-learning students, upon reflecting on their experience, find reward in helping others&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and in developing close personal relationships.&lt;ref name="Eyler 2007" /&gt;{{rp|56}} The second focus in the term ''service-learning'', that of ''learning'', is defined by R. L. Atkinson as "a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So What Is Learning?|url=http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/whatlearn.htm|website=What Is Learning?|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''service'' and ''learning'' components stressed by Eyler and Giles, author David Bornstein references motivation in service. In ''How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas'', he states: "The key difference [between highly successful and average entrepreneurs has] more to do with the quality of their motivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bornstein|first1=David|title=How to Change the World|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533476-0|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service learning is about taking the student out of the classroom and placing them in an environment where they can make a difference while also learning. Service learning strengthens not just the community that is being helped but the person who is giving their time and effort to their cause, which benefits them socially, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. For many service learning is simply tending to basic human needs: food, water, clothes, and housing. Some organizations, such as The Salvation Army, also seek to attend to the spiritual side of service learning. They used the motto "soup, soap, and salvation"&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Andrzej Diniejko, [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/salvation-army-founded "The Origin and Early Development of the Salvation Army in Victorian England"], "The Victorian Web", 11 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to show what they wanted to do with their ministry. "The Salvation Army sees no conflict between spiritual and social ministry. It seeks to serve people so as to satisfy both the spiritual and social dimensions of their needs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/salvationarmy_1.shtml "Salvation Army"], BBC, 2009-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
One contributor to the study of service learning is [[Alexander Astin]]. Astin, the Allan M. Cartter Distinguished Professor of Higher Education Emeritus and founding director of both Cooperative Institutional Research Program and Higher Education Research Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin |url=https://gseis.ucla.edu/media/AlexanderAstinCV.pdf?x63302 |website=Curriculum Vitae |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, formed a Theory of Involvement. This theory explains how student involvement in co-curricular activities positively affects college outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Astin's Theory of Involvement |url=https://studentdevelopmenttheory.weebly.com/astin.html |website=Student Development Theory |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a 1998 study of college seniors, Astin demonstrated that service greatly improves critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eyler |first1=Janet |last2=Giles |first2=Dwight E., Jr. |title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? |date=1999 |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-7879-4483-1 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other skills, such as courage, forgiveness, and stewarding the earth, must be learned elsewhere. Therefore, she recommends service learning and community engagement, which “offer learning with and from wise people, who teach by example.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TEDxPioneerValley - Nadinne Cruz - Education on Fire.mov |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycbQwCb2Gl8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex swing''' (also known as a '''sling''') is a type of [[:wikt:harness|harness]] designed to allow [[sexual intercourse]] between one partner suspended by the swing and another who moves freely. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/208/sex-sling | title=What does Sex Sling mean | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Though there is considerable variety in the design, the most common sex swings have a support for the back, another for the [[buttocks]], and [[stirrup]]s for each leg, which can be adjusted whilst the user is suspended. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/what-the-pathetic-case-against-rentboy-com-says-about-sex-work/ | title=What the Pathetic Case Against Rentboy.com Says About Sex Work | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of sex swing exist: traditional swing, door swing, body swing, and fantasy swing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The body swing is suspended from one partner's body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The door swing is mounted on a door.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 28, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514085912/http://www.passionshop.com/blog/sex-toys/how-to-use-a-sex-swing/ |archivedate=May 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fantasy swing is suspended from an [[eye bolt]] in the ceiling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with [[BDSM]] practices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/20/dungeons-and-genital-clamps-inside-a-legendary-bdsm-chateau.html | title=Dungeons and Genital Clamps: Inside a Legendary BDSM Chateau | accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Sling.jpg|thumb|[[Hammock]]-style sling for sexual activity]]
A sex swing or sling is designed to assist in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] activity.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Materials for constructing these devices include [[nylon]] [[webbing]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[canvas]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[leather]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[neoprene]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} heavy [[natural rubber|rubber]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[wood]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}and [[steel]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The designs provide access to the passive (receptive) partner's [[Sex organ|genitalia]], [[perineum]], buttocks, and [[Anus|anal]] areas while supporting the individual in a comfortable position, with the hips flexed, to allowing the passive partner to fully relax.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The most common sex swing is similar to a [[hammock]] and holds the receptive partner in a [[supine position]] (back down).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} A variant of the hammock style is a hanging platform of wood or metal, padded for comfort, on which the receptive partner reclines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The hanging platform differs from the hammock style in that, being rigid, the receptive partner's back is straight rather than bowed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Both the hammock and hanging platform designs are often equipped with loops or stirrups to support the ankles or calves up without the requiring exertion by the receptive partner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} This allows the receptive partner's hips to be flexed without exertion, improving access to the areas of interest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Hammock-style swings vary in the number of suspension points from three (two at the hips and one at the head), to four (two at the hips and two at the shoulders), to five (two each at hips and shoulders, plus one at the head).{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The functional difference between these variants lies in the stability of the sling when in use: the more suspension points, the less movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} However, many users prefer to have a greater range of movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Another variation is the sit swing, which holds the receptive partner upright in sitting position, rather than supine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings take most of the body's weight with large padded loops around the thighs, or some similar arrangement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Sit swings are commonly suspended from a single point attached to the ceiling, to a free-standing sex swing stand, or a door.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Door swings offer quicker installation and lower cost, but sacrifice some flexibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Purpose ==

The main purpose of sex swings is to make sexual intercourse more exciting and effortless. A sex swing may enable greater freedom of movement during intercourse or assist with challenging [[sex position]]s.&lt;ref name="PassionShop How To"/&gt; Swings may be used for [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]] and [[Anal sex|anal]] sex, [[fellatio]], and [[cunnilingus]].

Sex swings can enable individuals with a physical impairment or [[disability]] to enjoy a wide range of sexual activities. Individuals with muscular weakness or [[arthritis]] may use a sex swing to reduce the strain on affected muscles or joints.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Individuals who use a [[wheelchair]] can engage in sexual activity using a sex swing suspended from a [[hoist (device)|hoist]].&lt;ref name="Wheelchair Sex Swing"&gt;{{cite web

== Safety ==

It is important to follow the provided instructions when using a sex swing. Secure mounting is vital to avoid injury to the suspended partner from falling. The use of [[toggle bolt]]s, such as would be used to hang a dreamcatcher, is not appropriate. Installing springs, if supplied, is important to reduce physical [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] to the suspended partner caused by rapid [[deceleration]] when bouncing in a sex swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''sex toy''' is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual pleasure]], such as a [[dildo]] or [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].  Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals and may be vibrating or non-vibrating.  The term ''sex toy'' can also include [[BDSM]] apparatus and [[sex furniture]] such as [[fisting sling|slings]]; however, it is not applied to items such as [[birth control]], [[pornography]], or [[condom]]s. Alternative expressions include '''adult toy''' and the dated euphemism '''marital aid''', although "marital aid" has a broader sense and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to supposedly enhance or prolong sex. Sex toys are most commonly sold at a [[sex shop]], but they may also be sold in a pharmacy/chemist store, a pornographic DVD store, or [[head shop]]. Today's sex toys are available in almost all countries for male and females.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Types==

=== Erotic electrostimulation ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
Another form of sex toy for both men and women are those for [[erotic electrostimulation]].

Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation dates back as early as the mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.

===Erotic furniture===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
[[Erotic furniture]] is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation.

===General penetrative toys===

}}
* [[Ben Wa balls]] are hollow metal balls inserted vaginally which can be worn inside the vagina for extended periods of time. The internal rolling is claimed to enhance orgasms.
* Love Balls are solid metal balls inserted vaginally prior to sex. The weight and agitation by penis or dildo enhance sensation. They were popularised by the novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and its film adaptation.
* A [[dildo]] is a non-vibrating device which is used for sexual stimulation of the vagina or anus. Dildos are generally made of silicone rubber, but can be made of other materials such as body safe metals such as titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, or glass. They are often made to resemble a penis, although some are C-shaped or S-shaped for G-spot or P-spot stimulation.
** A [[double penetration dildo]] is a long, usually flexible dildo with both ends designed for penetration. It allows for mutual penetration between two persons (or for double penetration of  a single female, both anally and vaginally).
** A [[strap-on dildo]] is a dildo worn in a harness, used to penetrate another person.
* A horseshoe is a non-vibrating sex toy which is shaped similar to a [[horseshoe]], which is put into the vagina and anus at the same time. It is made with softer plastics.
* [[Kegel exercise]]r, also known as vaginal barbells, eggs, or jugglers, are designed to improve muscle tone in the [[pelvic floor]], and can be used for sexual pleasure as well as enhancing vaginal response.
* A [[sex-machine]] is a motor-driven device that combines penetration with rotational or reciprocal movement, or both.&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;Leung, Isaac (2009).

Critical perspectives on sexuality and pornography in science and social fiction.''  [[RE/SEARCH]], {{ISBN|978-1-889307-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anal toys====
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|upright|thumb|Two butt plugs]]
* [[Anal beads]]
* [[Butt plug]]s are often shorter dildos intended for anal insertion.  They tend to have a flared base to prevent the device from becoming sucked into the rectum.
* [[Prostate massage]]rs are devices designed to stimulate a man's [[prostate]] for health and pleasure.

====Glass sex toys====
[[File:Glass Dildo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Glass [[Dildo]]]]
Glass sex toys are commonly made from clear medical grade [[borosilicate glass]] ("hard glass"). This particular type of safety toughened glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures, as well as physical shock without compromising its structural integrity.

The choice of this high-grade material provides safety in use and the option to heat or chill the toys. Borosilicate glass is also non-porous and can be sterilized to help prevent infection with reuse. The highest quality glass toys can even be put in the dishwasher making them easier to keep clean. As well as their practical qualities, a main selling point of glass sex toys is their visual appeal.

Some glass sex toys vibrate.  There are two main ways this can be achieved. Either the toy may have a hole into which a small bullet vibrator can be inserted, or the core of the glass design can be modified to form a standard vibrator. The latter option usually has a plastic cap covering the battery compartment, which will also house any control buttons or switches.

====Vibrators====
{{main|Vibrator (sex toy)}}
Vibrators are vibrating devices intended to stimulate the body. Vibrators come in a range of shapes and sizes, for internal or external use.  Some vibrators intended for internal use are [[Phallus|phallic]] in shape.  Small vibrators may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or [[cock ring]]. Penetrative vibrators usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average [[human penis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

* [[Anal vibrator]]s are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the [[prostate]] in men.  The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable.
*  Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation.  Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or [[cock ring]].
* Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market.
* [[G-spot vibrator]]s are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female [[G-spot]].
* The [[rabbit vibrator]], of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name="Sex and The City Episode Guide"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Sex and The City Episode Guide| publisher = HBO.com| url = http://www.hbo.com/city/episode/season1/episode09.shtml| accessdate =2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of "bunny ears" which sit each side of the [[clitoris]].
* Vibrator wands, such as the [[Hitachi Magic Wand]], are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers.&lt;ref name="christophertrout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trout |first1=Christopher |title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |accessdate=30 August 2014 |work=[[Engadget]] |date=28 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |archivedate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;  Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand, with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle). Separately sold removable silicone tops add extra texture or penetration options}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sybian]]s are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

===Nipple toys===
* A [[nipple clamp]] is a clamp used to stimulate the nipples by applying varying degrees of pressure.
* Suction devices are generally either rubber or glass.

===Penile toys===
[[Image:Sex Toy.png|thumb|100px|A penis sleeve]]
* [[Artificial vagina]]s, also known as "pocket pussies" or "male masturbators", are tubes made of soft material to simulate [[sexual intercourse]]. The material and often textured inner canal are designed to stimulate the [[Human penis|penis]] and induce [[orgasm]]. The male masturbators come in many shapes and styles; they can be shaped like [[vulva]]s, anuses, mouths, or as non-descriptive holes. Some male masturbators are [[disposable]] and some can be washed and used repeatedly. Some are equipped with [[sex-machine]] options that work similar to [[milking machines]].&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray Broadus|year=1982|title=Objects of special devotion: fetishism in popular culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO5DkzptBeoC|page=49|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cock harness is a more elaborate harness designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with [[BDSM]] activities such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock and ball torture]]. An [[Arab strap (sexual device)|Arab strap]] is one such form of harness, purported to be a device used for maintaining an erection.
* [[Cock ring]]s prolong male erection by holding blood inside the penis. A man may wear a cock-ring to combat erectile difficulties, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one provides. Some models include a protruding [[Clitoris|clitoral]] stimulator, designed to stimulate the clitoris during sex. Others vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular 'Dolphin' variant by using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to both the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings also have [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] attached which can be worn to stimulate a partner during [[sexual intercourse]], especially in the [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremerestraints.com/nova-silicone-cock-ring-and-prostate-vibe.html|title="Nova Silicone Cock Ring and Prostate Vibe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other cock rings have arms that rub and apply pressure to the [[perineum]] of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Albert G|year=1994|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5439007|title=United States Patent 5,439,007 "Suspensory"|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A triple crown is a special cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract toward the body before [[ejaculation]]. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.
* A docking sleeve is a cylindrical device similar to a penis sleeve, but is open at both ends, so that two men can [[List of sex positions#Genital-genital sex|dock]], a form of [[Mutual masturbation#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]].
* A penis extension is a partially hollow device like a very short dildo, with the hollow end placed on the end of the penis, intended to increase the effective length of the penis, again for the benefit of the person being penetrated. These are generally worn with condoms to prevent them from falling off during use.
* A penis sleeve is a cylindrical device that is placed on the shaft of the penis, with the aim of increasing stimulation for the person being penetrated. They often have soft bumps intended to provide further stimulation.

==Health, safety, and privacy concerns==

No safety regulations exist in the sex toy industry. The sex toys are sold as novelty items so they do not need to adhere to certain regulations such as reporting the chemicals and materials used in a product. Due to this status, manufacturers are not responsible if their toys are used for any other purpose than being a novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|publisher=www.kinseyconfidential.org|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations such as [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|title=REACH - ECHA|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate=24 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; do exist, and some sex toys may be compliant to this though, despite that there is no obligation for manufacturers on attaining compliance.  A 2006 study conducted by the [[Greenpeace]] Netherlands office found high level of [[phthalate]]s in seven out of eight plastic sex toys tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal Bad vibrations? We expose an EU sex scandal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514001824/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal |date=2008-05-14 }} Posted by bex (8 September 2006)Greenpeace UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex toys are classified as novelties in the United States because the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has extensive testing and financial requirements in order for sex toys to be classified as medical devices. Therefore, sex toy manufacturers more often choose less complex production by labelling them a novelty, where their listed ingredients do not have to be accurate in chemical composition or percentage of ingredients.  Due to the novelty classification, sex toys may contain toxins such as phthalates, which have been banned in children's toys by the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]].&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation - Kinsey Confidential|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phthalates|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Phthalates-Information/|publisher=www.cpsc.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phthalates are chemical plasticizers that are added as softeners, to create the malleable and soft effect that many look for in sex toys.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;

Studies on rodents have revealed that when exposed to very large doses, phthalates can cause damage to the liver, lungs, kidneys, testes and can cause hormonal disruption. The latest research indicates that exposure to these substances can upset the body's ability to regulate hormone production, damage reproduction, can cause liver and kidney defects, and can cause cancer. The most common and external side-effects are rashes, itchiness and irritation to the locations of use.

Before using a sex toy, owners should take precautions.  One should check for tears, rough seams or cracks  that could harm the inside of the vagina or anus.  Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use appropriate lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.&lt;ref name=brownedu&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Toys|url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php/|publisher=[[Brown University]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning sex toys is also very important for sexual health and sex toy safety.  Cleaning them will avoid the potential of bacterial infection, transmission of STIs (if shared), or pregnancy (if sperm is present on the toy).  Porous sex toys (ridged, flexible, soft and squishy) are difficult to clean and can hide bacteria that multiply and harm the human body. Non-porous toys are easier to clean, being less harmful.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;  When cleaning sex toys, always use warm water and unscented anti-bacterial soap.&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;

Non-porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Glass toys: some can be put in the dishwasher, but it is recommended not to expose them to extreme temperatures and to wash them with soap and water.
* Stainless Steel toys: boil or soak stainless steel toys in 1-10 bleach-water solution for ten minutes, put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, or use soap and water (if there are electrical components to the toy).
* Hard plastic toys: do not boil the toy, and wash with soap and water.
* Silicone toys: put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, boil for 5–10 minutes, or wash with water and soap.

Porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Rubber toys: they cannot be properly cleaned because bacteria is absorbed into the material, so it is recommended to always use a condom.
* Cyberskin and Vinyl toys: clean with warm water, air dry, and sprinkle it with a small amount of cornstarch (to keep them dry and not sticky).
* Nylon toys: put it in the top rack of the dish-washer or wash with soap and water.

Anal toys ([[butt plug]]s, small dildos, etc.)
*When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this serious problem, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|publisher=www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the security software company [[Trend Micro]] demonstrated that some sex toys are vulnerable to [[cyberattack]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Sex Toys Could Be Vulnerable To Cyberattack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-toy-cyberattack_us_56e82b02e4b065e2e3d74bb5|work=Huffington Post|date=15 March 2016|author=Caroline Copley|agency=Reuters|location=Hanover, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating the field of [[Tor hidden services|onion dildonics]].&lt;ref name="Onion Dildonics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=Smart dildos and vibrators keep getting hacked – but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex|quote=Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

==Legal issues==

===India===
Sex toys are illegal in India.&lt;ref name ="singh2007"&gt;Singh, Jyotsna (20 June 2007). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6221540.stm India rattled by vibrating condom.] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Selling sex toys is a punishable offense under section 292 of Indian penal code, as sex toys are considered an "obscene" product. Besides sex toys, any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or any other object, is by the way also considered obscene by section 292 if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Big-market-for-sex-toys-despite-ban/articleshow/2164155.cms|title=Big market for sex toys despite ban|author=Rati Chaudhary|date=1 July 2007|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for the offense is up to two years in prison.&lt;ref name ="timesindia"&gt;Staff report (February 2, 2011).

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], many [[dildo]]s are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as [[Hello Kitty]], rabbits or dolphins, so that they may be sold as toys, thus avoiding [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the sale and importation of sex toys is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Christina|title=Shop online but don't break the law|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/07/28/Shop-online-but-dont-break-the-law/|accessdate=17 October 2014|work=The Star (Malaysia)|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 18A of the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], inserted by the [[Immorality Amendment Act, 1969]], prohibited the manufacture or sale of any item "intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act". The term "unnatural sexual act" referred to any sex other than vaginal heterosexual sex, and this prohibition was ostensibly aimed at preventing the use of [[dildo]]s by [[lesbian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kevan |last1=Botha |first2=Edwin |last2=Cameron |authorlink2=Edwin Cameron |editor1-first=Donald J. |editor1-last=West |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Green |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison |chapter=South Africa |year=1997 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-45532-3 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer enforced, the section was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===United States===
{{see also|Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Texas obscenity statute}}
Sex toys and lubricants have become increasingly available in major commercial outlets in the United States. On-shelf displays tend to be more discreet than the offerings on web sites. These items tend to be displayed in the "sexual health" sections of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/110965|title=Sex Aids on Retail Shelves|date=13 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, many [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] and some [[Great Plains|Great Plains states]] banned the sale of sex toys completely, either directly or through laws regulating "obscene devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lingere Store Accused of Violating State Obscenity Laws | publisher = KBCD.com | url = http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], an assistant attorney general in [[Alabama]] commenting on a case involving sex toys and discussing to what end the devices are used, was quoted as saying there is no "fundamental right for a person to buy a device to produce [[orgasm]]". A federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys on Valentine's Day, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, Phillip. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-01-2390404063_x.htm Court leaves Ala. sex toy ban intact], USA Today, Oct 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a [[Texas]] statute banning the sales of sex toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appeals court overturns Texas ban on sex toys | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23155562 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court cited ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', where the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at "enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct".  Similar statutes have been struck down in [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]].

[[Marty Klein]], author of ''America's War on Sex'' and an advocate for the moral value of sex toys, has described the sex toy bans as a form of [[erotophobia]] and [[genophobia]] claiming the "extraordinary erosion of personal liberty, coupled with the massive disrespect of and fear of sexuality is no joke" and that the "Supreme Court [of the United States] has declared our orgasms a battlefield, and sex toys another casualty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Holthouse|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005085548/http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|url=http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|archive-date=5 October 2009|title=Alabama vs. Dildos: Attorney General Troy King stands hard against stimulators|magazine=Dame Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of German Chemists''' (German: ''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker}}'', GDCh) is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1949 to represent the interests of German chemists in local, national and international contexts. GDCh "unites those people associated with the chemical and molecular sciences and supports them in their responsible and sustainable endeavors for the good of the public and of our environment."&lt;ref&gt;Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker (GDCh), [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/statement__e.htm  Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest precursor of today's GDCh was the [[German Chemical Society]] (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft zu Berlin}}'', DChG).  [[Adolf von Baeyer]] was prominent among the German chemists who established DChG in 1867; and [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] was the first president.&lt;ref name="gdch1"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/historie__e.htm  History]&lt;/ref&gt;  This society was modeled after the [[British Chemical Society]], which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, DChG sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout Germany and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski"&gt;[[J J Lagowski|Lagowski, J. J.]] (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''[[Journal of Chemical Education]],'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the Royal Society of Chemistry; retrieved 2011-06-08&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the current organization was created by a merger of the German Chemical Society (DChG) and the [[Association of German Chemists]] (''{{lang|de|Verein Deutscher Chemiker}}'', VDCh).

Honorary Members of the GDCh have included [[Otto Hahn]], [[Robert B. Woodward]], [[Jean-Marie Lehn]], [[George Olah]] and other eminent scientists.&lt;ref name="gdch2"&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/gdch/eps__e.htm  Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Scientific publications of the society include ''{{lang|de|Nachrichten aus der Chemie}},''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/nch__e.htm  ''Nachrichten aus der Chemie'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Angewandte Chemie]],'' ''[[Chemistry: A European Journal]],''  ''[[European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry]],'' ''[[European Journal of Organic Chemistry]],'' ''[[ChemPhysChem]],'' ''[[ChemSusChem]],'' ''[[ChemBioChem]],'' ''[[ChemMedChem]],'' ''[[ChemCatChem]],'' ''[[ChemistryViews]],'' ''Chemie Ingenieur Technik'' and ''[[Chemie in unserer Zeit]].''&lt;ref&gt;GDCh, [http://www.gdch.de/taetigkeiten/zeitschriften__e.htm  Journals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including medals originally conferred by the predecessor organizations DChG and VDCh:
* [[Hoffman Medal]] (''Hofmann Denkmünze''), first awarded to [[Henri Moissan]], 1903&lt;ref name="gdch1"/&gt;

'''The Streeter–Phelps equation''' is used in the study of [[water pollution]] as a [[water quality modelling]] tool. The model describes how [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) decreases in a river or stream along a certain distance by degradation of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). The equation was derived by [[H. W. Streeter]], a sanitary engineer, and [[Earle B. Phelps]], a consultant for the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], in 1925, based on field data from the [[Ohio River]]. The equation is also known as the DO sag equation.

== Streeter-Phelps equation ==
The Streeter–Phelps equation determines the relation between the [[dissolved oxygen]] concentration and the [[biological oxygen demand]] over time and is a solution to the linear first order differential equation&lt;ref name="Streeter 1925"&gt;Streeter  H. W., Phelps E. B., 1925, A Study of the pollution and natural purification of the Ohio river. III. Factors concerned in the phenomena of oxidation and reaeration, Public Health Bulletin no. 146, Reprinted by U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Public Health Service, 1958, ISBN B001BP4GZI, http://dspace.udel.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/handle/19716/1590/C%26EE148.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial D}{\partial t} = k_1 L_t -k_2 D &lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation states that the total change in oxygen deficit (D) is equal to the difference between the two rates of [[deoxygenation]] and reaeration at any time.

The Streeter–Phelps equation, assuming a plug-flow stream at steady state is then
:&lt;math&gt; D =\frac{k_1 L_a}{k_2-k_1} (e^{-k_1 t}-e^{-k_2 t}) + D_a e^{-k_2 t} &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:DOsag curve.jpg|thumb|Streeter-Phelps DO sag curve and BOD development.]]

where
*&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation deficit, which can be derived from the dissolved oxygen concentration at saturation minus the actual dissolved oxygen concentration (&lt;math&gt;D = DO_{sat} - DO&lt;/math&gt;). &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; has the dimensions &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deoxygenation]] rate, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; is the reaeration rate, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial oxygen demand of organic matter in the water, also called the ultimate BOD (BOD at time t=infinity). The unit of &lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;L_t&lt;/math&gt; is the oxygen demand remaining at time t, &lt;math&gt;L_t=L_a e^{-k_1 t}&lt;/math&gt;. 
*&lt;math&gt;D_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial oxygen deficit &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the elapsed time, usually &lt;math&gt;[d]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; lies typically within the range 0.05-0.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; lies typically within the range 0.4-1.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"&gt;Schnoor J., 1996, Environmental Modeling, Fate and Transport of Pollutants in Water, Air and Soil, Wiley-Interscience, {{ISBN|978-0-471-12436-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Streeter–Phelps equation is also known as the DO sag equation. This is due to the shape of the graph of the DO over time.

=== Critical oxygen deficit ===
On the DO sag curve a minimum concentration occurs at some point, along a stream. If the Streeter–Phelps equation is differentiated with respect to time, and set equal to zero, the time at which the minimum DO occurs is expressed by
:&lt;math&gt; t_{crit}= \frac{1}{k_2-k_1} \ln {\left[ \frac{k_2}{k_1}  \left({1- \frac{D_a(k_2-k_1)}{L_a k_1} }\right) \right]}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the value of the critical oxygen deficit, &lt;math&gt;D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;, the Streeter–Phelps equation is combined with the equation above, for the critical time, &lt;math&gt;t_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration is
:&lt;math&gt;DO_{crit} = DO_{sat}-D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that, mathematically it is possible to get a negative value of &lt;math&gt;DO_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;, even though it is not possible to have a negative amount of DO in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gotovtsev A.V., 2010, Modification of the Streeter–Phelps System with the Aim to Account for the Feedback between Dissolved Oxygen Concentration and Organic Matter Oxidation Rate, ISSN 0097-8078, Water Resources, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 245–251. Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance traveled in a river from a given point source pollution or waste discharge downstream to the &lt;math&gt;DO_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; (which is the minimum DO) is found by
:&lt;math&gt;x_{crit}=v t_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity of the stream. This formula is a good approximation as long as the flow can be regarded as a plug flow (turbulent).

=== Estimation of reaeration rate ===
Several estimations of the reaeration rate exist, which generally follow the equation
:&lt;math&gt;k_2=K v^a H^{-b}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity [m/s].
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the depth [m].
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

The constants depend on the system to which the equation is applied, i.e. the flow velocity and the size of the stream or river. Different values are available in the literature.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The software “International Hydrological Programme” applies the following equation derived on the basis of values used in published literature&lt;ref name="Jol1997"&gt;Jolánkai G., 1997, Basic river water quality models, Computer aided learning (CAL) programme on water quality modelling (WQMCAL version 1.1), International Hydrological Programme, Technical Documents in Hydrology, No. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_2=2.148 v^{0.878} H^{-1.48}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;[d^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the average flow velocity [m/s].
*&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the average depth of flow in the river [m].

=== Temperature correction ===
Both the deoxygenation rate, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and reaeration rate, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; can be temperature corrected, following the general formula.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k=k_{20} \theta ^{(T-20)}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*&lt;math&gt;k_{20}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at 20 degrees Celsius.
*'''θ''' is a constant, which differs for the two rates.
*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the actual temperature in the stream in degC.

Normally '''θ''' has the value 1.048 for &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and 1.024 for &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;.
An increasing temperature has the most impact on the deoxygenation rate, and results in an increased critical deficit (&lt;math&gt;D_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;x_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; decreases. Furthermore, a decreased &lt;math&gt;DO_{sat}&lt;/math&gt; concentration occurs with increasing temperature, which leads to a decrease in the DO concentration.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

===Mixing of rivers===
When two streams or rivers merge or water is discharged to a stream it is possible to determine the BOD and DO after mixing assuming [[steady state]] conditions and instantaneous mixing.  The two streams are considered as dilutions of each other thus the initial BOD and DO will be &lt;ref name="Jol1997"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; L_a= \frac{L_sQ_s+L_bQ_b}{Q_s+Q_b}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; DO_0= \frac{DO_s Q_s+DO_b Q_b}{Q_s+Q_b}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration of BOD in the river downstream of the mixing, also called BOD(0). The unit of &lt;math&gt;L_a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  L_b &lt;/math&gt; is the background BOD of the concentration in the river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  L_s &lt;/math&gt; is the BOD of the content of the merging river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the initial concentration of the dissolved oxygen in the river downstream of the conjoining point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_b &lt;/math&gt; is the background concentration of the dissolved oxygen content in the river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  DO_s &lt;/math&gt; is the background concentration of the dissolved oxygen content in the merging river &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_b &lt;/math&gt; is the flow in the river upstream from the mixing point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{m^3}{s}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;  Q_s &lt;/math&gt; is the flow in the merging river upstream from the mixing point &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{m^3}{s}]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Numerical approach ===
Nowadays it is possible to solve the classical Streeter–Phelps equation numerically by use of computers. The [[differential equation]]s are solved by integration.

== History ==
In 1925, a study on the phenomena of oxidation and reaeration in the [[Ohio River]] in the US was published by the sanitary engineer, Harold Warner Streeter and the consultant, [[Earle B. Phelps|Earle Bernard Phelps]] (1876–1953). The study was based on data obtained from May 1914 to April 1915 by the [[United States Public Health Service]] under supervision of Surg. W.H. Frost.&lt;ref name="Streeter 1925"/&gt;

More complex versions of the Streeter-Phelps model were introduced during the 1960s, where computers made it possible to include further contributions to the oxygen development in streams. At the head of this development were O'Connor (1960) and Thomann (1963).&lt;ref&gt;Russell C. S.,Vaughan W. J., Clark C. D., Rodriguez D. J., Darling A. H., 2001, Investing in water quality: measuring benefits, costs and risks,
Inter-American Development Bank, Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor added the contributions from photosynthesis, respiration and sediment oxygen demand (SOD).&lt;ref&gt;Lung W. S., 2001, Water quality modeling for wasteload allocations and TMDLs, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomann expanded the Streeter-Phelps model to allow for multi segment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Wurbs R. A., 1994, Computer Models for Water-Resources Planning and Management, Texas A &amp; M University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and limitations ==

The simple Streeter-Phelps model is based on the assumptions that a single BOD input is distributed evenly at the cross section of a stream or river and that it moves as [[plug flow]] with no mixing in the river.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"/&gt; Furthermore only one DO sink (carbonaceous BOD) and one DO source (reaeration) is considered in the classical Streeter-Phelps model.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1986"&gt;Schnoor J., 1986, Environmental Modeling, Fate and Transport of Pollutants in Water, Air and Soil, Wiley-Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; These simplifications will give rise to errors in the model. 
For example the model does not include BOD removal by sedimentation, that suspended BOD is converted to a dissolved state, that sediment has an oxygen demand and that photosynthesis and respiration will impact the oxygen balance.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Lin SD,Lee CC|title=Water and Wastewater Calculations Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjx6ZXNPcOEC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2001|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-137195-7|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expanded model ==
In addition to the oxidation of organic matter and the reaeration process, there are many other processes in a stream which affect the DO.&lt;ref name="Lin2001"/&gt; In order to make a more accurate model it is possible to include these factors using an expanded model.

The expanded model is a modification of the traditional model and includes internal sources (reaeration and photosynthesis) and sinks (BOD, background BOD, SOD and respiration) of DO.
It is not always necessary to include all of these parameters. Instead relevant sources and sinks can be summed to yield the overall solution for the particular model.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
Parameters in the expanded model can be either measured in the field or estimated theoretically.

=== Background BOD ===
Background BOD or benthic oxygen demand is the diffuse source of BOD represented by the decay of organic matter that has already settled on the bottom. This will give rise to a constant diffuse input thus the change in BOD over time will be
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dL}{dt}= -k_1 L + L_b &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate for oxygen consumption by BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the BOD from organic matter in the water &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;L_b&lt;/math&gt; is the background BOD input &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sedimentation of BOD ===
Sedimented BOD does not directly consume oxygen and this should therefore be taken into account. This is done by introducing a rate of BOD removal combined with a rate of oxygen consumption by BOD. Giving a total rate for oxygen removal by BOD &lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k_r=k_1 + k_3 &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; k_1 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of oxygen consumption by BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; k_3 &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of settling of BOD, usually in &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The change in BOD over time is described as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dt}= -k_r L &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the BOD from organic matter in the water &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;k_r&lt;/math&gt; is typically in the range of 0.5-5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Sediment oxygen demand ===
[[File:sedimentation Oxygen demand10.jpg|thumb|Measurement of SOD using an oxygen electrode. A: Water, B: Sediment, C: Box, D: Oxygen electrode.]]
Oxygen can be consumed by organisms in the sediment. This process is referred to as sediment oxygen demand (SOD). Measurement of SOD can be undertaken by measuring the change of oxygen in a box on the sediment.(benthic respirometer)

The change in oxygen deficit due to consumption by sediment is described as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = -k_2 D + \frac{S}{H} &lt;/math&gt;
where 
* &lt;math&gt;H &lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the river [m]
* &lt;math&gt;S &lt;/math&gt; is the SOD &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}]&lt;/math&gt;
* D is the saturation deficit &lt;math&gt;[\tfrac{\mathrm g}{\mathrm m^3}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt; k_2 &lt;/math&gt; is the reaeration rate [&lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;].

The range of the SOD is typically in the range of 0.1 – 1 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}&lt;/math&gt; for a natural river with low pollution and 5 – 10 &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{g}{m^2 d}&lt;/math&gt; for a river with moderate to heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Nitrification ===
[[Ammonium]] is oxidized to [[nitrate]] under aerobic conditions
:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Ammonium oxidation can be treated as part of BOD, so that BOD = CBOD + NBOD, where CBOD is the [[carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand]] and NBOD is nitrogenous BOD. Usually CBOD is much higher than the ammonium concentration and thus NBOD often does not need to be considered. The change in oxygen deficit due to oxidation of ammonium is described as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = k_{N} N -k_2D &lt;/math&gt;

where
* D is the saturation deficit.
*&lt;math&gt;k_N&lt;/math&gt; is the nitrification rate &lt;math&gt;[d^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is ammonium-nitrogen concentration.

The range of &lt;math&gt;k_N&lt;/math&gt; is typically 0.05-0.5 &lt;math&gt;d^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

=== Photosynthesis and respiration ===
[[Photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] are performed by algae and by macrophytes. Respiration is also performed by bacteria and animals. Assuming [[steady state]] (net daily average) the change in deficit will be
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dD}{dt} = -k_2 D + (R+P)_{avg} &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is the respiration &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is the photosynthesis &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that BOD only includes respiration of [[microorganism]]s e.g. algae and bacteria and not by [[macrophyte]]s and animals.

Due to the variation of light over time, the variation of the photosynthetic oxygen can be described by a periodical function over time, where time is after sunrise and before sunset&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P(t)=P_{max} sin \left( \frac{\pi}{f}+(t-t_s) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;P(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the photosynthesis at a given time &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; P_{max} &lt;/math&gt; is the daily maximum of the photosynthesis &lt;math&gt;[ \tfrac{mg}{Ld}]&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of day with sunlight, usually &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; day.
* &lt;math&gt; t_s &lt;/math&gt; is the time at which sun rises &lt;math&gt;[d]&lt;/math&gt;.

The range of the daily average value of primary production &lt;math&gt;(P-R)&lt;/math&gt; is typically 0.5-10 &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{mg}{Ld}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schnoor1996"/&gt;

'''''The Garden of Cyrus''''', or ''The Quincuncial [[Lozenge]], or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered'', is a [[discourse]] by [[Sir Thomas Browne]]. First published in 1658, along with its [[diptych]] companion, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Urn-Burial]]'', in modern times it has been recognised as Browne's major literary contribution to [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] wisdom.&lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/what-is-more-beautiful-than-quincunx.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html |title=Scintillae marginila: Sparkling margins - Alchemical and Hermetic thought in the literary works of Sir Thomas Browne |author=Faulkner, Kevin |date=2002 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:The Garden of Cyrus (1658) frontispiece.gif|thumb|right|Frontispiece to ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658)]]Written during a time when restrictions on publishing became more relaxed during [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]], ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658) is Browne's contribution to a 'boom period' decade of interest in esoterica in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alchemywebsite.com/eng_bks.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Browne's discourse is a [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] vision of the interconnection of [[art]] and [[nature]] via the inter-related symbols of the number [[5|five]] and the [[quincunx]] pattern, along with the figure [[X]] and the [[Latticework|lattice]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Huntley Sir Thomas Browne: a Biographical and Critical Study Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Its fundamental quest was of primary concern to Hermetic philosophy: proof of the wisdom of [[God]], and demonstrable evidence of [[intelligent design]]. The Discourse includes early recorded usage of the words '[[prototype]]' and '[[archetype]]' in English.

'''The Technical Cooperation Program''' ('''TTCP''') is a long-standing international organisation concerned with cooperation on defence science and technology matters, including national security and civil defence. Its membership comprises [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US).

==History==

===Declaration Of Common Purpose===

TTCP commenced in 1957 as a bilateral activity between the United Kingdom and the United States when the US President and the UK Prime Minister made the following Declaration of Common Purpose:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/ttcp/|title=TTCP website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The arrangements which the nations of the free world have made for collective defense and mutual help are based on the recognition that the concept of national self sufficiency is now out of date. The countries of the free world are interdependent and only in genuine partnership, by combining their resources and sharing tasks in many fields, can progress and safety be found. For our part we have agreed that our two countries will henceforth act in accordance with this principle.}}

===Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program===

Immediately following the Declaration of Common Purpose, the Canadian government subscribed to the principle of interdependence and was admitted by the UK and the US. The resulting arrangement was known as the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Program (or TTCP for short).

===Australia and New Zealand===

Australia joined TTCP in 1965; the organisation's name was changed from '''''Tripartite''' Technical Cooperation Program'' to '''''The''' Technical Cooperation Program'', which allowed the abbreviation for the organisation to be kept as '''TTCP'''. New Zealand joined TTCP in 1969.

==Organisation==

===Top level===

The organisation of TTCP is headed up by a senior official from each of the five participating nations, known collectively as the Principals. Supporting the Principals are their TTCP Deputies, based in Washington, and a secretariat.

===Technical organisation===

Reporting to the Principals are a number of multilateral&lt;!-- What is a "multilateral" group?? --&gt; "TTCP Groups", each comprising Technical Panels and time limited Action Groups. In April 2009 there were 11 TTCP Groups:
*Aerospace Systems Group
*Chemical, Biological &amp; Radiological Defence Group (CBR)
*Conventional Weapons Technology Group
*Command, Control, Communications &amp; Information Systems Group (C3I)&lt;ref&gt;Note that although C3I is more commonly used as an abbreviation for Command, Control, Communications &amp; Intelligence, in the case of TTCP, the I abbreviates "Information". Two reasons for this are that there is a separate group of Five Eyes organisations that address cooperation in the Intelligence domains, and Intelligence is NOT part of the TTCP domain.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Electronic Warfare Systems Group (EW)
*Human Resources &amp; Performance Group (HUM)
*Joint Systems &amp; Analysis Group (JSA)
*Land Systems Group
*Maritime Systems Group
*Materials &amp; Processing Technology Group
*Sensors Group

Each Technical Panel is expected to establish and monitor major collaborative projects in priority areas of defined mutual national interest. An Action Group is more limited in scope than a Technical Panel and has clearly stated objectives and preset milestones. It is formed by a "TTCP Group" to address a specific high priority problem and is terminated on completion of its assignment.

With the cutbacks in US and Australian defense/defence spending at the start of the 2010s, international [[face-to-face interaction]] in TTCP has been severely reduced.

==The "Five Eyes" and other international organisations==

Three TTCP nations (Canada, UK and the US) are also members of the [[NATO Research and Technology Organisation]]. Four of the nations (Australia, Canada, UK and US) are also members of the twenty seven nation [[Multilateral Interoperability Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mip-site.org/010_Public_Home_News.htm Multilateral Interoperability Programme website]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five TTCP nations, only the UK is a member of the [[European Defence Agency]].

Collectively the five nations comprising TTCP are often referred to as the "[[Five Eyes]]" community for intelligence and also participate in the following related activities:

The '''United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs''' ('''UN DESA''') is part of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] and is responsible for the follow-up to major United Nations Summits and Conferences, as well as services to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and the Second and Third Committees of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="bio2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/ousg/#bioSection| title=About Mr. Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN DESA assists countries around the world in [[agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]] and decision-making with the goal of meeting their economic, social and environmental challenges. It supports international cooperation to promote sustainable development for all, having as a foundation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] ('''SDGs''') as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice, and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and continues to play a key role in monitoring progress towards internationally agreed-upon development goals. It is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P%3D13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
UN DESA is part of the UN Secretariat, which is funded through regular assessed contributions from Member States. The Department was reorganized into its present form in 1997. The Department is headed by Liu Zhenmin who assumed the office of Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, following his appointment to this position by Secretary-General António Guterres on 26 July 2017. Mr. Liu advises the Secretary-General on the three pillars of sustainable development—social economic and environmental, and nurtures key partnerships with governments, UN agencies and civil society organizations, including the SDGs. In directing and managing UN DESA, the Under-Secretary-General is supported by the Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and the Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs.

== Mission ==
UN DESA’s mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] for all, focusing on the most vulnerable. This reflects a fundamental concern for equity and equality in countries large and small, developed and developing. It underscores the need for all stakeholders – governments, UN and other international organizations, civil society and the private sector – to do their part to improve economic and social well-being. This emphasis on equitable participation by all people and nations is what makes the United Nations unique and gives the development agenda its universal legitimacy.

== Function ==
UN DESA’s work programme can be categorized into three areas:

[[File:Sdgdesa.jpg|thumb|550px|frame|right|Adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on 25 September 2015]]

'''Norm-setting''': 
By facilitating major global conferences and summits, as mandated by [[UN Member States]], UN DESA assists countries as they find common ground and take decisive steps forward. Specifically, UN DESA is tasked with supporting deliberations in two major UN charter bodies: the UN General Assembly and UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), including ECOSOC’s subsidiary bodies. 
In addition, UN DESA organises and supports consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society. In this regard, UN DESA’s main priorities are promoting progress toward and strengthening accountability in achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, UN DESA is responsible for ensuring civil society engagement with the UN through the ECOSOC bodies.

'''Data and Analysis''':
UN DESA, generates, analyzes and compiles a wide range of official economic, social and environmental data and information on which Member States draw to review common problems and to take stock of policy options. One of the Department’s primary contributions is providing policy research and analysis for governments to use in their deliberations and decision-making&lt;ref name="SDG Indicators Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/| title=DESA's flagship data resources and analytic publications|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UN DESA is also the lead “author” Department of the UN Secretariat. The research and analytical work covers a range of economic, social and environmental issues. The Department  produces a host of flagship publications and major intergovernmental reports, which are essential to UN negotiations and global policy decisions. The publications are distributed in print and electronic formats around the world.

'''Capacity-building''':
UN DESA also advises Member States / Governments on implementing the policies and programmes developed at UN conferences back in their home countries. It assists interested Governments in translating policy frameworks developed in UN conferences and summits into programmes at the country level and, through technical assistance, helps build national capacities.

== Divisions ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:UN-DESA-ornigramm.jpg|thumb|240px|Overview of the UN DESA divisions]]  --&gt;
'''Economic Analysis and Policy Division:'''
The [https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/ Economic Analysis and Policy Division] is the think-tank for development economics within DESA and the main development research unit within the United Nations.

'''Wastewater''' (or '''waste water''') is any [[water]] that has been affected by human use. Wastewater is "used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, [[surface runoff]] or [[stormwater]], and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies – (2nd Revised Edition)|last = Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph., Zurbrügg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 175|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408021403/http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|archivedate = 8 April 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, wastewater is a byproduct of domestic, industrial, commercial or [[Agriculture|agricultural]] activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include: domestic wastewater from households, municipal wastewater from communities (also called [[sewage]]) or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] from industrial activities. Wastewater can contain physical, chemical and biological [[pollutant]]s.

Households may produce wastewater from [[flush toilet]]s, sinks, dishwashers, washing machines, bath tubs, and showers. Households that use [[dry toilet]]s produce less wastewater than those that use flush toilets.

Wastewater may be conveyed in a [[sanitary sewer]] which conveys only sewage. Alternatively, it can be transported in a [[combined sewer]] which includes [[Surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] and industrial wastewater. After treatment at a [[wastewater treatment plant]], the treated wastewater (also called effluent) is discharged to a receiving water body. The terms "wastewater reuse" or "[[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]]" apply if the treated waste is used for another purpose. Wastewater that is discharged to the environment without suitable treatment causes [[water pollution]].

In developing countries and in rural areas with low population densities, wastewater is often treated by various [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems and not conveyed in sewers. These systems include [[septic tank]]s connected to [[septic drain field|drain fields]], [[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sewage systems]] (OSS), [[vermifilter]] systems and many more.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The overarching term [[sanitation]] includes the management of wastewater, [[human excreta]], [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]] and [[stormwater]]. 
The term [[sewerage]] refers to the physical infrastructure required to transport and treat wastewater.

== Sources ==
Sources of wastewater include the following domestic or household activities:
* [[Human waste|Human excreta]] ([[Human feces|feces]] and [[urine]]) often mixed with used [[toilet paper]] or wipes; this is known as [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] if it is collected with [[flush toilet]]s
* Washing water (personal, clothes, floors, dishes, cars, etc.), also known as [[greywater]] or [[sullage]]
* Surplus manufactured liquids from domestic sources (drinks, cooking oil, [[pesticide]]s, [[lubricant|lubricating oil]], [[paint]], cleaning liquids, etc.)

Activities producing [[Industrial wastewater treatment#Sources of industrial wastewater|industrial wastewater]]:
*[[Industrial stormwater|Industrial site drainage]] (silt, sand, alkali, oil, chemical residues);
*Industrial cooling waters ([[biocide]]s, heat, slimes, silt)
*Industrial processing waters
*Organic or [[biodegradable]] waste, including waste from [[hospital]]s, [[abattoir]]s, [[creamery|creameries]], and [[food]] factories.
*Organic or non bio-degradable waste that is difficult-to-treat from [[pharmaceutical]] or [[pesticide]] manufacturing
*Extreme [[pH]] waste from [[acid]] and [[alkali]] manufacturing 
*[[Toxic]] waste from metal [[plating]], [[cyanide]] production, [[pesticide]] manufacturing, etc.
*[[Solids]] and [[emulsion]]s from [[paper]] mills, factories producing lubricants or hydraulic [[oil]]s, foodstuffs, etc.
*Water used in [[hydraulic fracturing]]
*[[Produced water]] from oil &amp; natural gas production

Other activities or events:
* [[Urban runoff]] from [[highway]]s, [[road]]s, carparks, roofs, sidewalks/pavements (contains oils, animal feces, [[litter]], [[gasoline]]/[[petrol]], [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or [[rubber]] residues from tires, soapscum, [[metal]]s from vehicle [[exhaust gas|exhausts]], de-icing agents, herbicides and pesticides from gardens, etc.)
*[[Agricultural pollution]], direct and diffuse

Wastewater can be diluted or mixed with other types of water by the following mechanisms:
* [[Seawater]] ingress (high volumes of [[salt]] and [[microbe]]s)
* Direct ingress of [[river]] water 
* [[Rain]]fall collected on roofs, yards, hard-standings, etc. (generally clean with traces of [[oil]]s and [[fuel]])
* [[Groundwater]] infiltrated into sewage
* Mixing with other types of wastewater or [[fecal sludge]]

== Pollutants ==
The composition of wastewater varies widely. This is a partial list of pollutants that may be contained in wastewater:

=== Chemical or physical pollutants ===
* [[Toxic heavy metal|Heavy metals]], including [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], and [[chromium]]
* [[Organic material|Organic]] particles such as [[feces]], [[hair]]s, [[food]], [[vomiting|vomit]], paper fibers, plant material, [[humus]], etc.;
* [[Soluble]] organic material such as [[urea]], fruit sugars, soluble [[protein]]s, [[medication|drugs]], [[pharmaceuticals]], etc.;
* [[Inorganic]] particles such as [[sand]], grit, metal particles, [[ceramic]]s, etc.;
* Soluble inorganic material such as [[ammonia]], road-salt, sea-salt, [[cyanide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[thiocyanate]]s, [[thiosulfate]]s, etc.;
* Macro-solids such as [[sanitary napkin]]s, [[Diaper|nappies/diapers]], [[condom]]s, [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], children's toys, dead animals or plants, etc.;
* [[Gases]] such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]], etc.;
* [[Emulsion]]s such as [[paint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[mayonnaise]], [[hair]] colorants, emulsified oils, etc.;
* [[Toxins]] such as [[pesticide]]s, [[poison]]s, [[herbicide]]s, etc.
* [[Pharmaceuticals]] and hormones and other hazardous substances
* [[Thermal pollution]] from [[power station]]s and industrial manufacturers

=== Biological pollutants ===
If the wastewater contains [[human feces]], as is the case for [[sewage]], then it may also contain [[pathogens]] of one of the four types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71253096|title=Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta, and greywater.|last=World Health Organization|first=|date=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|year=|isbn=9241546859|location=|pages=31|oclc=71253096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersson"&gt;Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnström, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C. (2016). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2636 Sanitation, Wastewater Management and Sustainability: from Waste Disposal to Resource Recovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601071836/http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2636 |date=1 June 2017 }}. Nairobi and Stockholm: United Nations Environment Programme and Stockholm Environment Institute. {{ISBN|978-92-807-3488-1}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Bacteria]] (for example ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''), 
* [[Virus]]es (for example [[hepatitis A]], [[rotavirus]], [[enteroviruses]]), 
* [[Protozoa]] (for example ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'') and 
* Parasites such as [[helminths]] and their eggs (e.g. ''[[Ascaris]]'' (roundworm), ''[[Ancylostoma]]'' (hookworm), ''[[Trichuris]]'' (whipworm));

It can also contain non-pathogenic bacteria and animals such as [[insect]]s, [[arthropod]]s, small [[fish]].

=== Quality indicators ===
{{Main|Wastewater quality indicators}}
Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD). Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD). Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of [[pollution]] effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants.

Any [[Redox|oxidizable]] material present in an aerobic natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] (bacterial) or chemical processes. The result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased.

== Treatment ==
{{Main|Wastewater treatment}}
At a global level, around 80% of wastewater produced is discharged into the environment untreated, causing widespread [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|title=The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017. Wastewater: The Untapped Resource|last=WWAP (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme)|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100201-4|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408061139/http://www.unwater.org/publications/publications-detail/en/c/853650/|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

There are numerous processes that can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can be treated in [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] which include physical, chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater is treated in [[sewage treatment plant]]s (which may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment plant]]s). Agricultural wastewater may be treated in [[agricultural wastewater treatment]] processes, whereas industrial wastewater is treated in [[industrial wastewater treatment]] processes.

For municipal wastewater the use of [[septic tank]]s and other On-Site Sewage Facilities ([[OSSF]]) is widespread in some rural areas, for example serving up to 20 percent of the homes in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. (2008). [http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf "Septic Systems Fact Sheet."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412140527/http://water.epa.gov/aboutow/owm/upload/2009_06_22_septics_septic_systems_factsheet.pdf |date=12 April 2013 }} EPA publication no. 832-F-08-057.&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of aerobic treatment system is the [[activated sludge]] process, based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed of micro-organisms able to absorb and [[adsorb]] the organic matter carried in the wastewater. Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes ([[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|UASB]], [[Expanded granular sludge bed digestion|EGSB]]) are also widely applied in the treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be highly treated and reused as [[reclaimed water]]. [[Constructed wetland]]s are also being used.

== Disposal ==
[[File:Wastewater effluent.JPG|thumb|right|Industrial wastewater effluent with neutralized pH from tailing runoff in Peru.|300px]]
In some urban areas, municipal wastewater is carried separately in [[sanitary sewer]]s and runoff from streets is carried in [[storm drain]]s. Access to either of these systems is typically through a [[manhole]].

During high precipitation periods a combined sewer system may experience a [[combined sewer overflow]] event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose a serious threat to [[public health]] and the surrounding environment.

Sewage may drain directly into major [[drainage basin|watersheds]] with minimal or no treatment but this usually has serious impacts on the quality of an environment and on the health of people. [[Pathogen]]s can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of [[bioaccumulation]] in animal or human tissue.

Wastewater from industrial activities may be pumped underground through an [[injection well]]. Wastewater injection has been linked to [[Induced seismicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Baan|first=Mirko|last2=Calixto|first2=Frank J.|date=2017-07-01|title=Human-induced seismicity and large-scale hydrocarbon production in the USA and Canada|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GC006915/abstract|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=2467–2485|doi=10.1002/2017gc006915|issn=1525-2027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water|Reuse of excreta}}
Treated wastewater can be reused in industry (for example in [[cooling towers]]), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in [[wetland]]s). In rarer cases it is also used to augment [[drinking water]] supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies: [[Ozonation]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[Aerobic treatment system|aerobic treatment]] ([[membrane bioreactor]]), [[forward osmosis]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[Advanced oxidation process|advanced oxidation]].

Some water demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where [[Flush toilet|toilets]] can be flushed using [[greywater]] from baths and showers with little or no treatment.

Irrigation with recycled wastewater can also serve to [[Fertilizer|fertilize]] plants if it contains nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. In developing countries, [[agriculture]] is using untreated wastewater for irrigation - often in an unsafe manner. There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. The [[World Health Organization]] developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;WHO (2006).
