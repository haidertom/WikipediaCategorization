'''Aaron Marcus''' (born 22 May 1943)&lt;ref name=CAO&gt;{{cite book|title=Aaron Marcus|work=Contemporary Authors Online|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] user-interface and information-visualization designer, as well as a computer graphics artist.

== Biography ==
Marcus was always interested in both science and technology as well as [[visual communication]]. He grew up in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], in the 1950s, he was interested in astronomy and paleontology, and drawing cartoons. He learned painting, and calligraphy. In secondary school, he studied science and art, and was editor of his high-school newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter for Alexenberg, Mel (2007). Educating Artists in a Digital Age. UK: Intellect Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his BA in Physics at  [[Princeton University]] in 1965. 
He obtained his BFA and MFA in 1968 at  [[Yale University]]’s School of Art and Architecture.
He learned about painting, drawing, printmaking, and letterpress printing workshops informally, photography, and art history. He also learned about book design, calligraphy, color, [[graphic design]], drawing, film making, printing, printmaking, painting, typography, and photography.

At Yale, while a design graduate student, he also began the study of [[computer graphics]], taking a course in basic functioning of computers, and he learned FORTRAN programming at the Yale Computer Center in the summer of 1966.

== Work ==
In 1967, Marcus spent a summer making [[ASCII art]] as a researcher at AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]].

From 1968 to 1977, in the School of Architecture and Urban Planning and in the Visual Arts Program, he taught at Princeton University: color, computer art, [[computer graphics]], concrete/visual poetry, environmental graphics, exhibit design, [[graphic design]], history/philosophy of design/visual communication, [[information design]], [[information visualization]], layout, publication design, systematic design, semiotics/semiologie, typography, and [[visual design]].

In 1969-71, he programmed a prototype desktop publishing page-layout application for AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
In 1971-73, he claims to have programmed some of the first virtual reality art/design spaces ever created while a faculty member at Princeton University.

In the early 1980s, he was a Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, as well as a faculty member of the [[University of California at Berkeley]]’s College of Environmental Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationdesign.org/special/marcus_interview.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he founded [[Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc.]] (AM+A), a user-interface design and consulting company, one of the first such independent, computer-based design firms in the world.

'''Aesthetic relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] of [[beauty]] are [[relativism|relative]] to differences in perception and consideration, and [[intrinsic|intrinsically]], have no absolute [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] 

==Overview==
Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical [[relativism]], which denies any absolute standards of [[truth]] or [[morality]] as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in [[postmodern]] theory is a fragment by [[Nietzsche]], entitled "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.")

For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the women in the paintings of [[Rubens]] would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, [[body modification]] among "[[primitive culture|primitive]]" peoples is sometimes regarded as [[grotesque]] by Western society. 

Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the "external world", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his "radical scepticism" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.

Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose "nativist" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).

The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

[[File:Africa (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Africa]]
'''African studies''' is the study of [[Africa]], especially the continent's cultures and societies (as opposed to its geology, geography, zoology, etc.). The field includes the study of Africa's [[history of Africa|history]] (Pre-colonial, [[colonisation of Africa|colonial]], [[decolonization of Africa|post-colonial]]), [[demographics of Africa|demography]] ([[ethnic groups in Africa|ethnic groups]]), [[culture of Africa|culture]], [[politics of Africa|politics]], [[economy of Africa|economy]], [[languages of Africa|languages]], and [[religion in Africa|religion]] ([[Islam in Africa|Islam]], [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]], [[Traditional African religion|traditional religions]]). A specialist in African studies is often referred to as an "Africanist". A key focus of the discipline is to interrogate [[epistemology|epistemological]] approaches, theories and methods in traditional disciplines using a critical lens that inserts African-centred ways of knowing and references.

For Africanists, also known as communitarians, problems within Africa are thought to be caused because the real flesh-and-blood communities that comprise Africa are marginalized from public life as so many "[[tribe]]s". Therefore, the solution is understood to be the need to defend culture and put Africa's age-old communities at the center of African politics. It is also argued that there is a need to "deexoticize" Africa and banalise it, rather than understand Africa as exceptionalized and exoticized.&lt;ref name=Mamdani&gt;Mamdani, M. (1996), Chapter 1 from Mamdani, M., ''Citizen and Subject: contemporary Africa and the legacy of late colonialism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Anthropology''' is the study of [[human]]s and [[human behavior]] and [[society|societies]] in the past and present.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web | title=anthropology | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology |work=Oxford Dictionaries | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology | title=anthropology | work=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Anthropology? | url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm | publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]] | accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life. [[Biological anthropology|Biological or physical anthropology]]&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa/&gt; studies the biological development of humans.

[[Archaeology]], which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.

==Origin and development of the term==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|History of anthropology}}
The abstract noun ''[[wikt:anthropology|anthropology]]'' is first attested in reference to [[history]].&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey]]'s 1593 ''Philadelphus'', a defense of the legend of [[Brutus of Britain|Brutus]] in [[History of Britain|British history]], includes the passage "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."}} Its present use first appeared in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] in the works of [[Magnus Hundt]] and [[Otto Casmann]].&lt;ref name="Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Israel Institute of the History of Medicine|title=Koroth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lev_H1Ie0zcC&amp;pg=PA19|publisher=BRILL|page=19|id=GGKEY:34XGYHLZ7XY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|anthropologia}}'' derived from the [[combining form]]s of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''ánthrōpos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἄνθρωπος}}}}, "[[human]]") and ''lógos'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|λόγος}}}}, "[[science|study]]").&lt;ref name=oed2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "anthropology, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Its adjectival form appeared in the works of [[Aristotle]].)&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt; It began to be used in English, possibly via [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|Anthropologie}}'', by the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=oed2/&gt;{{refn|group=n|[[John Kersey]]'s 1706 edition of ''[[The New World of English Words]]'' includes the definition "''Anthropology'', a Discourse or Description of Man, or of a Man's Body."}}

===Through the 19th century===
In 1647, the Bartholins, founders of the [[University of Copenhagen]], defined ''{{lang|fr|l'anthropologie}}'' as follows:&lt;ref name=frenchy&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartholin | first1=Caspar | last2=Bartholin | first2=Thomas | author-link1=Caspar Bartholin the Younger | author-link2=Thomas Bartholin | others=Translated from the Latin by Abr. Du Prat | year=1647 | title=Institutions anatomiques de Gaspar Bartholin, augmentées et enrichies pour la seconde fois tant des opinions et observations nouvelles des modernes | location=Paris | publisher=M. Hénault et J. Hénault | chapter=Preface }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.{{refn|group=n|In French: ''L'Anthropologie, c'est à dire la science qui traite de l'homme, est divisée ordinairment &amp; avec raison en l'Anatomie, qui considere le corps &amp; les parties, et en la Psychologie, qui parle de l'Ame''.&lt;ref name=frenchy/&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently, such as the use by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1839 to describe the natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy, and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)]] by [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau]]. Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Société Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Société was abandoned.

Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=Schiller131&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections.

Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[Ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.

Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Société de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Société d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U. S. National Museum under the Auspices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington in March and April 1882 | year=1882 | location=Boston; Washington, D.C. | publisher=D. Lothrop &amp; Co.; Judd &amp; Detweiler | url={{Google books|9dEJAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As [[Robert Fletcher (anthropologist)|Fletcher]] points out, the French society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic. Previous organizations used other names. The German Anthropological Association of St. Petersburg, however, in fact met first in 1861, but due to the death of its founder never met again.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt;}} When he read Darwin, he became an immediate convert to ''Transformisme'', as the French called [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broca, being what today would be called a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker'', 1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.

Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". By nature he meant matter animated by "the Divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Société'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.

During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382–390 | url={{Google books|PA385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===
This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical Anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. The organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;Hylland Eriksen, Thomas. (2004) "What is Anthropology" Pluto. London. p. 79. {{ISBN|0745323200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly prominent in the United States, from [[Boasian anthropology|Boas' arguments]] against 19th-century racial [[ideology]], through [[Margaret Mead]]'s advocacy for [[gender equality]] and sexual liberation, to current criticisms of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] oppression and promotion of [[multiculturalism]]. [[Ethnography]] is one of its primary [[research design]]s as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason," in ''Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyck|first1=Thomas William|last2=Stocking|first2=George W.|last3=Goody|first3=Jack|title=After Tylor: British Social Anthropology 1888–1951.|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=102|issue=5|year=1997|pages=1486–1488|issn=0002-8762|doi=10.2307/2171126|jstor=2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition of [[social anthropology]] tends to dominate. In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|''biological'' or ''physical'' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|''social'']], [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|''sociocultural'' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]]. These fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783). It is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) ''An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology''.

{{further|American anthropology}}

Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from [[natural science]]s, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', human physical traits, [[human behavior]], the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' has influenced its social organization and culture, and from [[social science]]s, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm What is Anthropology – American Anthropological Association].

According to [[Clifford Geertz]],
{{quotation|"anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology, comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|pages=Back Cover|editor1=Daniel A. Segal |editor2=Sylvia J. Yanagisako |isbn=0822386844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sociocultural anthropology]] has been heavily influenced by [[structuralism|structuralist]] and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades.

===Sociocultural===
{{main|Cultural anthropology|Social anthropology|Sociocultural anthropology}}
Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]]. Cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people ''make sense'' of the world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the ''relationships'' among individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=GENERAL INTRODUCTION | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold| year=1994 | pages=xv |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropology is more related to [[philosophy]], literature and [[the arts]] (how one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and institutions), while social anthropology is more related to [[sociology]] and history.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994pxv"/&gt; In that, it helps develop an understanding of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable degree.

Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by [[cultural relativism]], the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Introduction to culture | encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology | author=Ingold, Tim |authorlink=Tim Ingold | year=1994 | page=331 |isbn=0415021375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison.&lt;ref name="Ingold1996p18"&gt;{{cite book | title=Key Debates In Anthropology | author=[[Tim Ingold]] | year=1996|  page=18|quote=the traditional anthropological project of cross-cultural or cross-societal comparison}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is often accommodated in the field of [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic [[monograph]]. As a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a community or other research site. [[Participant observation]] is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernard |first=H. Russell |year=2002 |url=http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |title=Research Methods in Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104002847/http://www.antropocaos.com.ar/Russel-Research-Method-in-Anthropology.pdf |archive-date=4 November 2016 |publisher=[[Altamira Press]] |page=322 |isbn=0759108684 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an [[emic]] (conceptual, vs. [[etic]], or technical) point of view.

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Sociocultural anthropology also covers [[Economic anthropology|economic]] and [[Political anthropology|political organization]], law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.

===Biological===
{{main|Biological anthropology}}
[[File:Human remains.jpg|thumb|left|Forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains, such as these found lying in scrub in Western Australia, c. 1900–1910.]]

Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate, maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[University of Toronto]] |title=Research Subfields: Physical or Biological |access-date=14 March 2012 |url=http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422203737/http://www.anthropology.utoronto.ca/about/research/physical-or-biological |archive-date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Archaeological===
{{main|Archaeology}}

[[Archaeology]] is the study of the human past through its material remains. Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine this material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remain of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, R. H. &amp; Larkin, S. N. (2007). Cultural Anthropology: A problem based approach. Toronto, ON: Nelson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rosetta Stone.svg|thumb|The Rosetta Stone was an example of ancient communication.]]

===Linguistic===
{{main|Linguistic anthropology}}
[[Linguistic anthropology]] (not to be confused with [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2150|title=What is Anthropology? - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key topics by field: sociocultural ==

===Art, media, music, dance and film===
{{Anthropology of art}}

==== Art ====
{{main|Anthropology of art}}

One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''.&lt;/ref&gt; To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', Claude Lévi-Strauss' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.

==== Media ====
{{main|Media anthropology}}
[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]]
Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila |year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume= 59|pages= 109–133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Ethnomusicology}}
Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.

==== Visual ====
{{main|Visual anthropology}}
Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.

=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===
{{Economic anthropology}}

==== Economic ====
{{main|Economic anthropology}}
Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55–71|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=9780745644820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.

====Political economy====
{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}
Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==== Applied ====
{{main|Applied anthropology}}
Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).

====Development====
{{main|anthropology of development}}
Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail?

===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===
{{Anthropology of kinship}}

==== Kinship ====
{{main|Kinship}}
''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]]", "[[affinity (law)|affines]]", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.

==== Feminist ====
{{main|Feminist anthropology}}
Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialization. 

The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928-1982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633–635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===
{{Medical anthropology}}

==== Medical ====
{{main|Medical anthropology}}

Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation".&lt;ref name=McElroy1996&gt;{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D. Levinson |editor2=M. Ember |title=Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |isbn= |ref=harv |access-date=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001162708/http://www.univie.ac.at/ethnomedicine/PDF/Medical%20Anthropologie.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that William Caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=2016-10-24|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine : MJM|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
* the patient-physician relationship
* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments
* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole
* the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004, 2007)
* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.

Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.

==== Psychological ====
{{main|Psychological anthropology}}
Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=D'Andrade | first=R. | chapter=The Sad Story of Anthropology: 1950–1999 | editor-first=E.

M. White |display-editors=etal | date = 1992 | title = New Directions in Psychological Anthropology | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive ====
{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}
Cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="D'Andrade"/&gt;

==== Transpersonal ====
{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}
Transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Young | first1=David E. | first2=J.G. | last2=Goulet | date=1994 | title=Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences | publisher=Peterborough: Broadview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and legal===
{{Political anthropology}}

==== Political ====
{{main|Political anthropology}}
Political anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on "Negara", the Balinese state, is an early, famous example.

====Legal====
{{main|Legal anthropology}}
Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=0801419719| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor1=Hent de Vries |editor2=Lawrence E. Sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

====Public====
{{main|Public anthropology}}
Public anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature, science and technology ===
{{Cyber anthropology}}

====Cyborg====
{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}
Cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001). "Cyborg Anthropology". in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0415920922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.

==== Digital ====
{{main|Digital anthropology}}
Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virtual anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer |author1=Weber, Gerhard |author2=Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological ====
{{main|Ecological anthropology}}
Ecological anthropology is defined as the "study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments".&lt;ref name="Kottak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579–584|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-field is also defined as, "the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]".&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of its research concerns "how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how their environment across space and time.&lt;ref name="Kottak CP 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227632647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]]. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, century anthropology and more.&lt;ref name="Pyke G 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyke|first1=G H|title=Optimal Foraging Theory: A Critical Review|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|page=523|year=1984|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002515|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243636746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.&lt;ref name="Checker M 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Melissa Checker|title=Polluted promises: environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GCcgMi40WkC|date=August 2005|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1657-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
{{main|Ethnohistory}} {{see also|Historical anthropology}}
Ethnohistory is the study of [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] cultures and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] customs by examining [[History|historical records]]. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint |  journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 | jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{main|Anthropology of religion}}
The anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"&gt;[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''An Essay On Man''], pt.II, ch.7 ''Myth and Religion'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.]&amp;nbsp;... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion."&lt;ref name="Cassirer1944"/&gt;}} and that every religion is a cultural product, created by the human [[community]] that worships it.&lt;ref name="Guthrie2000p225"&gt;Guthrie (2000) ''Guide to the Study of Religion''.

=== Urban ===
{{main|Urban anthropology}}
Urban anthropology is concerned with issues of [[urbanization]], poverty, and [[neoliberalism]]. [[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were "a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the "[[Third World]]" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of "[[Anthropology#Focus on the "other cultures"|specialists in 'other cultures']]" closer to their homes.&lt;ref name=Hannerz/&gt; There are two main approaches to urban anthropology: examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1466138110370412 |jstor=24047982|title=Chinese consumers: The Romantic reappraisal|journal=Ethnography|volume=11|issue=3|page=331|year=2010|last1=Griffiths|first1=M.

== Key topics by field: archaeological and biological ==
{{main|Archaeological|Biological anthropology}}

=== Anthrozoology ===
{{main|Anthrozoology}}
[[Anthrozoology]] (also known as "human–animal studies") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI, pp. 28–30. {{ISBN|0851997244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo (2010).

=== Biocultural ===
{{main|Biocultural anthropology}}
Biocultural anthropology is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and culture. [[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn&gt;{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L. Leatherman (eds.) |title=Building A New Biocultural Synthesis |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year= 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T8ZhpG_B_6MC |isbn= 978-0-472-06606-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology.

=== Evolutionary ===
{{main|Evolutionary anthropology}}
Evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the [[human evolution|evolution]] of [[human physiology]] and [[human behaviour]] and the relation between [[hominins]] and non-hominin [[primate]]s. Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

=== Forensic ===
{{main|Forensic anthropology}}
Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim's remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective "forensic" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.

=== Palaeoanthropology ===
{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}
Paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.

== Organizations ==
Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]. AAAnet.org. Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Its members are anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613021448/http://aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.

Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Wong, Kate (2007).

==Ethics==
As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Commission to Review the AAA Statements on Ethics - Participate &amp; Advocate|url=http://www.americananthro.org/ParticipateAndAdvocate/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1911&amp;RDtoken=3371&amp;userID=6944|publisher=American Anthropological Association|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = "pbuteh"&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) ''Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter.'' Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:
* That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derives some of its key notions from it, consciously or not. (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) [http://okhovvat.com/files/en/content/2011/6/4/351_379.pdf ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion'']. London/New York: Routledge. pp. 26–29. {{ISBN|041508024X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That ethnographic work is often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were "out of time" in an "ethnographic present" (Johannes Fabian, ''Time and Its Other'').

=== Cultural relativism ===
As part of their quest for [[scientific objectivity]], present-day anthropologists typically urge [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Ingold1994p331"/&gt; This is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another's values or viewpoints, but be examined dispassionately on their own terms. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude (1962). ''The Savage Mind''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Womack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human.''.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin. ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Is there a gene for racism? | Times Higher Education (THE)]. Times Higher Education (2016-10-27). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on "Race"|url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm|publisher=American Anthropological Association|date=May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.654 |pmid=9841421 |title=CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY:DNA Studies Challenge the Meaning of Race |journal=Science |volume=282 |issue=5389 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |last1=Marshall |first1=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Allan (1995).

Ortiz|url=https://www.academia.edu/199944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military involvement===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the [[Axis Powers]] (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments&amp;nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology]. CSMonitor.com (2007-09-07). Retrieved on 2016-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century |url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html |archivedate=21 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the American Anthropological Association's Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of "anthropology" within DoD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System"].

==Post–World War II developments==
Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

===Basic trends===
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato (1993).  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. Inda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier, John and Rosaldo, Renato (2007).  ''The Anthropology of Globalization''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert; Kilgore, Lynn; Trevathan, Wenda and Ciochon, Russell L. (2007).  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. chapters I, III and IV. {{ISBN|0495187798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wompack, Mari (2001). ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–20. {{ISBN|0136440711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald (1991).  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughley, Neil (2000).  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs.

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

===Commonalities between fields===
Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy (2003). ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12. {{ISBN|1442601108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George (1992) "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology", pp. 342–361 in George Stocking, ''The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0299134148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray (1979). ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh University Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al., Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures—Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the "[[Third World]]" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.&lt;ref name=Hannerz&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz|Hannerz, Ulf]] (1980) ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'', {{ISBN|0-231-08376-9}}, p. 1. ISBN Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' "100:" 716–731&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody|Goody, Jack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-87069-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field |journal = [[Cultural Anthropology (journal)|Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 | jstor = 08867356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).

Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale. There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Michael M. J. (2003) ''Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, '''biosystems engineering''' is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological and environmental sciences. It represents an evolution of engineering disciplines applied to all living organisms not including biomedical applications. Therefore, biosystems engineering is 'the branch of engineering that applies engineering sciences to solve problems involving biological systems' (according to Erabee Network).

In the US, biosystems engineering (see also [[biological systems engineering]]) is a field of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological, environmental and agricultural sciences.  It represents an evolution of the agricultural engineering discipline applied to all living organisms (but generally not including biomedical applications, which is the realm of biomedical engineering).

In many institutions in the US, biosystems engineering is synonymous with [[biological engineering]].  In some institutions, biosystems engineering is considered a broader term which includes [[agricultural engineering]] and biological engineering also agricultural and biosystems engineering.

Typical programmatic areas include: production of [[bioenergy]]; development of [[biosensors]]; environmental and [[ecological engineering]]; [[controlled-environment agriculture]]; food processing and [[food safety]]; [[agricultural engineering]] (machinery, irrigation, storage), [[water quality]], water quantity, and water recycle (including measurements of pathogens, chemicals, and other contaminants).

The '''blue sky catastrophe''' is a form of orbital indeterminacy, and an element of bifurcation theory.

==Orbital dynamics==
Blue sky catastrophe is a type of [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] of a [[periodic orbit]]. In other words, it describes a sort of behaviour stable solutions of a set of differential equations can undergo as the equations are gradually changed. This type of bifurcation is characterised by both the [[Orbital period|period]] and [[length]] of the orbit approaching infinity as the control parameter approaches a finite bifurcation value, but with the orbit still remaining within a [[wikt:bounded|bounded]] part of the [[phase space]], and without loss of [[orbit (dynamics)#Stability of orbits|stability]]  before the bifurcation point. In other words, the orbit ''vanishes into the blue sky''.

==Applications of blue sky catastrophe in other fields==
The bifurcation has found application in, amongst other places, [[slow-fast model]]s of [[computational neuroscience]]. The possibility of the phenomenon was raised by [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] in 1971, and explored by [[R.L. Devaney]] and others in the following decade. More compelling analysis was not performed until the 1990s.

This bifurcation has also been found in the context of [[fluid dynamics]], namely in double-diffusive convection of a small [[Prandtl number]] fluid. Double diffusive convection occurs when convection of the fluid is driven by both thermal and concentration gradients, and the temperature and concentration diffusivities take different values. The bifurcation is found in an orbit that is born in a global saddle-loop bifurcation, becomes chaotic in a period doubling cascade, and disappears in the blue sky catastrophe.

The '''British Nutrition Foundation''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|251681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC040061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticised for conflicts of interest and for acting as an industry lobby group.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. It is based between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] and [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]] tube stations. The BNF educational programme, ''Food - a fact of life'', was launched in 1991.

==Aims==
According to its entry in the Charity Commission's register, the aims of the British Nutrition Foundation are:
#to advance the education of the public, and those involved in the training and education of others, in nutrition; and
#to advance the study of and research into nutrition for the public benefit, and to disseminate and publish the useful results of such research.&lt;ref name=CharityCommission&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=251681&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title= Charity framework|publisher= [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The BNF's team of nutrition scientists conduct academic reviews of published research on issues of diet and public health.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=2|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present their reports in the BNF's Nutrition Bulletin, as well as various Task Force reports, intended for both academic and lay dissemination.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg/&gt; The BNF also organises educational programs designed to provide accessible information on diet and health for children and young people, aged 3–16+ years.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=1|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF's education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation/&gt;

The BNF receives funding for its projects from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities.&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do|title= Who we are, what we do|year= 2009|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns have been raised about the BNF's close relationship with the food industry.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|title= Independence of nutritional information?|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]]|location= London|accessdate= 23 February 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425125849/http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|archivedate= 25 April 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF receives funding from almost every large food manufacturer and distributor in the UK, including [[Tate and Lyle]], [[Nestle]], [[PepsiCo]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Sainsburys]].

Furthermore, Paul Hebblethwaite, a member of the BNF board of trustees and its former chairman, has had "a distinguished career in the food industry working for a number of major companies including [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] and [[Chivers-Hartley]]".&lt;ref name=BNFNews&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/288_Issue%2047%20Spring%202009.pdf|title= BNF News|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Trade Association.&lt;ref name=BNFNews/&gt; Many other members of the organisation’s board of trustees and oversight committees are or have been employees of the food industry.&lt;ref name=BNFReport09&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/330_BNF%20Annual%20Report%202008%2009.pdf|title= Annual Report and Accounts|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNF is open about its intention to shape UK Government policy on food,&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre/&gt; and this has led to concerns that it is serving as a lobbying group for the food industry which largely funds it.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt; Derek Shrimpton, former director general, has been quoted as saying: "In the period I was there the foundation was solely taken up with defence actions for the industry." He said that the foundation had been constantly engaged in frustrating government committees aiming to recommend reductions in sugars, salt, and fats.&lt;ref name=CannonG&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=G|title=The Politics of Food|year=1997|publisher=Century|location=London|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catenaria in terra cruda a più corsi di conci.jpeg|400px|thumb|right|A [[mudbrick]] catenary arch]]
[[File:Hanging chain and arch.svg|400px|thumb|right|A [[catenary curve]] (left) and a catenary arch, also a catenary curve (right). One points up, and one points down, but the curves are the same.]]

A '''catenary arch''' is a type of [[architecture|architectural]] [[pointed arch]] that follows an inverted [[catenary curve]]. It is common in [[cathedral]]s and in [[Gothic arch]]es used in [[Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref name="American Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/the-perfect-dome|title=Letter to the Editors: The Perfect Dome|author=Handy, Richard L.|date=May 2011|work=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a [[parabolic arch]].

==In history==
[[File:17 Robert Hooke Engineer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|alt=Painting of Robert Hooke seated in a study, holding a small chain suspended between his hands by the ends|[[Robert Hooke]], holding a hanging [[chain]], which forms a catenary curve]]

The 17th-century scientist [[Robert Hooke]] wrote, "''Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum''", or, "As hangs a flexible cable so, inverted, stand the touching pieces of an arch." &lt;ref name="The enigma of Robert Hooke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantumfrontiers.com/2015/08/31/the-enigma-of-robert-hooke/|title=The enigma of Robert Hooke|author=|date=31 August 2015|work=Quantum Frontiers|publisher=Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, California Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A note written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1788 reads, "I have lately received from Italy a treatise on the equilibrium of arches, by the Abbé Mascheroni. It appears to be a very scientifical work. I have not yet had time to engage in it; but I find that the conclusions of his demonstrations are, that every part of the [[catenary]] is in perfect equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|title=Memoir, Correspondence, and Miscellanies, from the Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 2|date=1830|publisher=Gray and Bowen|location=Boston|page=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjw-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;lpg=PA416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural properties==
What makes the catenary arch important is its ability to withstand weight.&lt;ref name="St. Louis Gateway Arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/history/us/monuments/stlouisarch/|title=St. Louis Gateway Arch|author=|date=|work=enchantedlearning.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strath.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.strath.ac.uk/j.wood/Biomimetics/Engineering%20Areas/structures/PROP%201_files/PROP%201.htm|title=Building an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=strath.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an arch of uniform density and thickness, supporting only its own weight, the catenary is the ideal curve.&lt;ref name="The inverted catenary arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zonedome.com/?p=167|title=The inverted catenary arch|author=|date=|work=zonedome.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is done by a catenary curve: Catenary arches are strong, as they redirect the vertical force of gravity into compression forces pressing along the arch's curve. In a uniformly loaded catenary arch, the [[line of thrust]] runs through its center.&lt;ref name="Build an arch that can stand up by itself"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/files/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group1/catenary_arch/media/catenary_g.pdf|title=Build an arch that can stand up by itself|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting the arch back into architecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/203465/203465.pdf|title=Getting the arch back into architecture|author=Karl Robin Nilsson|date=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural arches=== 
[[File:LandscapeArchPano.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Landscape Arch]], [[Utah]]]]

[[Rainbow Natural Bridge]] in the U.S. state of [[Utah]] has a natural catenary shape, possibly produced by [[weathering]] in high-stress areas.&lt;ref name="Arctic"/&gt; [[Kolob Arch]] and [[Landscape Arch]], also in Utah, have a catenary shape as well.&lt;ref name="The Dimensions of Kolob Arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalarches.org/archinfo/kolob.htm|title=The Dimensions of Kolob Arch|author=Jay H.

Following interaction with their specific chemokine [[ligand]]s, chemokine receptors trigger a [[flux#Biology|flux]] in [[intracellular]] calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions ([[calcium signaling]]). This causes cell responses, including the onset of a process known as [[chemotaxis]] that traffics the cell to a desired location within the organism.  Chemokine receptors are divided into different families, [[CXC chemokine receptors]], [[CC chemokine receptors]], [[CX3CR1|CX3C chemokine receptors]] and [[XCR1|XC chemokine receptors]] that correspond to the 4 distinct subfamilies of chemokines they bind. Four families of chemokine receptors differ in spacing of cysteine residues near N-terminal of the receptor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kakinuma|first=Takashi|last2=Hwang|first2=Sam T.|date=2006-04-01|title=Chemokines, chemokine receptors, and cancer metastasis|journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=639–651|doi=10.1189/jlb.1105633|issn=0741-5400|pmid=16478915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural characteristics==
Chemokine receptors are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s containing 7 [[transmembrane]] domains &lt;ref name="Arimont_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arimont A, Sun S, Smit MJ, Leurs R, de Esch IJ, de Graaf C | title = Structural Analysis of Chemokine Receptor-Ligand Interactions | journal = J Med Chem | year = 2017 | pmid = 28165741 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that are found predominantly on the surface of [[leukocyte]]s. Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which share many common structural features; they are composed of about 350 [[amino acid]]s that are divided into a short and acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three [[intracellular]] and three [[extracellular]] [[hydrophilic]] loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues that act as [[phosphorylation]] sites during receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]ing between two conserved [[cysteine]] residues.  The [[N-terminal]] end of a chemokine receptor binds to chemokine(s) and is important for ligand specificity. [[G-protein]]s couple to the C-terminal end, which is important for receptor signaling following ligand binding. Although chemokine receptors share high amino acid identity in their primary sequences, they typically bind a limited number of ligands.&lt;ref name="Murdoch_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murdoch C, Finn A | title = Chemokine receptors and their role in inflammation and infectious diseases | journal = Blood | volume = 95 | issue = 10 | pages = 3032–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10807766 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemokine receptors are redundant in their function as more than one chemokine is able to bind to a single receptor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Signal transduction==
{{details|G protein}}
[[Cell signaling|Intracellular signaling]] by chemokine receptors is dependent on neighbouring G-proteins. G-proteins exist as a heterotrimer; they are composed of three distinct subunits.   When the molecule [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] is bound to the G-protein subunit, the G-protein is in an inactive state. Following binding of the chemokine ligand, chemokine receptors associate with G-proteins, allowing the exchange of GDP for another molecule called [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], and the dissociation of the different G protein subunits. The subunit called Gα activates an [[enzyme]] known as [[Phospholipase C]] (PLC) that is associated with the [[cell membrane]]. PLC cleaves [[Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) to form two [[second messenger]] molecules called [[inositol triphosphate]] (IP3) and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG); DAG activates another enzyme called [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades, effecting a cellular response.&lt;ref name="Murdoch blood"/&gt;  

For example, when CXCL8 (IL-8) binds to its specific receptors, [[CXC chemokine receptors#CXCR1 and CXCR2|CXCR1]] or [[CXC chemokine receptors#CXCR1 and CXCR2|CXCR2]], a rise in intracellular calcium activates the enzyme [[phospholipase D]] (PLD) that goes on to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade called the [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MAP kinase pathway]].  At the same time, the G-protein subunit Gα directly activates an enzyme called [[Tyrosine kinase|protein tyrosine kinase]] (PTK), which phosphorylates [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues in the tail of the chemokine receptor, causing its desensitisation or inactivation.&lt;ref name="Murdoch blood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murdoch |first1=Craig |last2=Finn |first2=Adam |title=Chemokine receptors and their role in inflammation and infectious diseases |journal=Blood |date=2000 |volume=95 |page=3032-3043 |pmid=10807766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiated [[MAP kinase]] pathway activates specific cellular mechanisms involved in [[chemotaxis]], [[degranulation]], release of [[superoxide]] anions, and changes in the avidity of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s called [[integrin]]s.&lt;ref name = Murdoch_2000/&gt; Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial role in cancer metastatis as they are involved in extravastation, migration, micrometastatis, and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This role of chemokine is strikingly similar to their normal function of localizing leukocytes to an inflammatory site.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Selective pressures on Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) ==
[[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|Human Immunodeficiency virus]] uses CCR5 receptor to target and infect host [[T cell|T-cells]] in humans. It weakens the immune system by destroying the CD4+ T-helper cells, making the body more susceptible to other infections. [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] is an allelic variant of CCR5 gene with a 32 base pair deletion that results in a truncated receptor. People with this allele are resistant to AIDS as HIV cannot bind to the non-functional CCR5 receptor. An unusually high frequency of this allele is found in European [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population, with an observed cline towards the north.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most researchers have attributed the current frequency of this allele to two major epidemics of human history: plague and smallpox. Although this allele originated much earlier, its frequency rose dramatically about 700 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led scientists to believe that bubonic plague acted as a selective pressure that drove [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] to high frequency. It was speculated that allele may have provided protection against the [[Yersinia pestis|Yerisinia pestis]], which is the causative agent for plague. Many i[[In vivo|n vivo]] mouse studies have refuted this claim by showing no protective effects of  [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] allele in mice infected with Y. pestis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mecsas|first=Joan|last2=Franklin|first2=Greg|last3=Kuziel|first3=William A.|last4=Brubaker|first4=Robert R.|last5=Falkow|first5=Stanley|last6=Mosier|first6=Donald E.|date=2004-02-12|title=Evolutionary genetics: CCR5 mutation and plague protection|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6975|pages=606|doi=10.1038/427606a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=14961112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Styer|first=Katie L.|last2=Click|first2=Eva M.|last3=Hopkins|first3=Gregory W.|last4=Frothingham|first4=Richard|last5=Aballay|first5=Alejandro|date=2007-07-01|title=Study of the role of CCR5 in a mouse model of intranasal challenge with Yersinia pestis|journal=Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur|volume=9|issue=9|pages=1135–1138|doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2007.04.012|issn=1286-4579|pmc=2754264|pmid=17644454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory that has gained more scientific support links the current frequency of the allele to smallpox epidemic. Although plague has killed a greater number people in a given time period, smallpox has collectively taken more lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As [[smallpox]] has been dated back to 2000 years, a longer time period would have given smallpox enough time to exert selective pressure given an earlier origin of CCR5-Δ32.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Population genetic models that analyzed geographic and temporal distribution of both plague and smallpox provide a much stronger evidence for smallpox as the driving factor of CCR5-Δ32.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galvani|first=Alison P.|last2=Slatkin|first2=Montgomery|date=2003-12-09|title=Evaluating plague and smallpox as historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Delta 32 HIV-resistance allele|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100|issue=25|pages=15276–15279|doi=10.1073/pnas.2435085100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=299980|pmid=14645720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox has a higher mortality rate than plague, and it mostly affects children under the age of ten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From an evolutionary viewpoint, this results in greater loss of reproductive potential from a population which may explain increased selective pressure by smallpox. Smallpox was more prevalent in regions where higher CCR5-Δ32 frequencies are seen. [[Myxoma]] and [[Variola Major|variola major]] belong to the same family of viruses and myxoma has been shown to use [[CCR5]] receptor to enter its host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalani|first=A. S.|last2=Masters|first2=J.|last3=Zeng|first3=W.|last4=Barrett|first4=J.|last5=Pannu|first5=R.|last6=Everett|first6=H.|last7=Arendt|first7=C.

Recent evidence provides a strong support for smallpox as the selective agent for CCR5-Δ32.

==Families==
* [[CXC chemokine receptors]] (seven  members)
* [[CC chemokine receptors]] (ten/eleven members)
* C chemokine receptors (one member, [[XCR1]])
* CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C chemokine receptors (one member, [[CX3CR1]])
Fifty chemokines have been discovered so far, and most bind onto CXC and CC families.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Two types of chemokines that bind to these receptors are inflammatory chemokines and homeostatic chemokines. Inflammatory chemokines are expressed upon leukocyte activation, whereas homeostatic chemokines show continual expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36362">'''Cognitive biology''' is an emerging science that regards natural [[cognition]] as a [[biological function]].&lt;ref&gt;p133 in Lyon and Keijzer (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [[organism]]—whether a single cell or [[multicellular]]—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Duijn, et al. (2006). "Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination."&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007). “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; And since by [[Darwinian theory]] the [[species]] of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), "Comparative cognition of object recognition.".&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,&lt;ref&gt;Baluška and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‘neural’ upside-down.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, ''[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
While [[cognitive science]] endeavors to explain human thought and the [[conscious mind]], the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large&lt;ref&gt;[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), “Elephant cognition in primate perspective.”&lt;/ref&gt; and small,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). "Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.”&lt;/ref&gt; both plant&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Calvo and Keijzer  (2009), "Cognition in plants."&lt;/ref&gt; and animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ ''Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; “Mounting evidence suggests that even [[bacteria]] grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007), “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; Without thinking or [[Perception|perceiving]] as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], then finds an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a ''[[science]]'' of cognitive biology has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science''. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prolegomena]]&lt;ref&gt;At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.” See Lyon and Opie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kováč, discussed below.&lt;/ref&gt; have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.

Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive biology should not be confused with the [[Santiago Theory of Cognition|biology of cognition]] in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inteco.cl/biology/&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana (1970), “Biology of Cognition.”&lt;/ref&gt; who crafted the doctrine of [[autopoiesis]]. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by [[Brian Goodwin]] (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977), "Cognitive biology." A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper—Goodwin (1978), “A cognitive view of biological process,”—is easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ’78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by [[Brian Goodwin|Brian C. Goodwin]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977) "Cognitive biology."&lt;/ref&gt; There and in several related publications&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin’s concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. 
 
Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin’s conception by [[Margaret Boden]] in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, [[Ladislav Kováč]]. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.

By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kováč.
 
=== Kováč’s cognitive biology ===

Ladislav Kováč's “Introduction to cognitive biology” (Kováč, 1986a) lists ten ‘Principles of Cognitive Biology.’ A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: “Overview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.” (Kováč, 1987). Over the following decades, Kováč elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including  "Fundamental principles of cognitive biology" (Kováč, 2000), “Life, chemistry, and cognition” (Kováč, 2006a), "Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal” (Kováč, 2007) and "Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind" (Kováč, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: &lt;http://www.biocenter.sk/lkpublics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University seminar ===
The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:&lt;ref&gt;The seminar, titled "Cognitive Biology," was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/ seminar description] was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]" The paper’s author and host of the seminar sessions was [[William Bechtel]], a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‘The life of cognitive science’, in ed. W. Bechtel and G. Graham, A Companion to Cognitive Science (Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd.), pp. 1–104. A more recent example: Abrahamsen, A. and Bechtel, W. (2012). History and core themes. In K. Frankish and W. Ramsey, The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Cquote|Cognitive science has focused primarily on human cognitive activities. These include perceiving, remembering and learning, evaluating and deciding, planning actions, etc. But humans are not the only organisms that engage in these activities. Indeed, virtually all organisms need to be able to procure information both about their own condition and their environment and regulate their activities in ways appropriate to this information. In some cases species have developed distinctive ways of performing cognitive tasks. But in many cases these mechanisms have been conserved and modified in other species. This course will focus on a variety of organisms not usually considered in cognitive science such as bacteria, planaria, leeches, fruit flies, bees, birds and various rodents, asking about the sorts of cognitive activities these organisms perform, the mechanisms they employ to perform them, and what lessons about cognition more generally we might acquire from studying them.&lt;ref&gt;In the preceding paragraph, neither mention nor definition of cognitive biology is made. Rather, context is established through the initial three sentences and an excellent description of cognitive biology is presented thereafter. The original seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session features a talk by Professor Bechtel titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== University workgroup ===
The [[University of Adelaide]] has established a "Cognitive Biology" workgroup using this operating concept:
{{Cquote|Cognition is, first and foremost, a natural biological [[phenomenon]] — regardless of how the engineering of artificial intelligence proceeds. As such, it makes sense to approach cognition like other biological phenomena. This means first assuming a meaningful degree of continuity among different types of organisms—an assumption borne out more and more by [[comparative biology]], especially [[genomics]]—studying simple model systems (e.g., [[microbes]], worms, flies) to understand the basics, then scaling up to more complex examples, such as mammals and [[primates]], including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., [[nematode]]) in regard to cognitive process and look for [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. “It is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: '''what cognition is''' and '''what cognition does''' in the biological context.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold letters from original text.)
 
The group’s choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‘[[embodied cognition]]’&lt;ref&gt;This option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the [[cognitive sciences]] in the 1970s: [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of [[embodied cognition]]. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘biological cognitive science.’&lt;ref&gt;Such a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals.&lt;/ref&gt; But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013b). “Why Cognitive Biology?” http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is ''[[biogenic substance|biogenic]]''. The host of the group’s website has said elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;See also Lyon and Opie (2007) “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), “The biogenic approach to cognition.”.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the [[Adelaide]] school of cognitive biology:

#“Complex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.”
#“Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .”
#“Cognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism’s continued persistence, well-being or replication.”
#“Cognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.”&lt;ref&gt;See Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other universities ===

* As another example, the Department für Kognitionsbiologie&lt;ref&gt;This is the official website for the Department für Kognitionsbiologie: &lt;http://cogbio.univie.ac.at/home&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Vienna declares in its mission statement a strong commitment “to experimental evaluation of multiple, testable hypotheses” regarding cognition in terms of evolutionary and developmental history as well as adaptive function and mechanism, whether the mechanism is cognitive, neural, and/or hormonal. “The approach is strongly comparative: multiple species are studied, and compared within a rigorous [[phylogenetic]] framework, to understand the evolutionary history and adaptive function of cognitive mechanisms (‘cognitive phylogenetics’).”&lt;ref&gt;Department für Kognitionsbiologie COGBIO: Department of Cognitive Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences,  University of Vienna, Austria&lt;/ref&gt; Their website offers a sample of their work: “Social Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogcom.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/proj_cognition_communication/neuron10170_apxutw.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A more restricted example can be found with the Cognitive Biology Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kobi.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU) in Magdeburg, Germany. The group offers courses titled “Neurobiology of Consciousness” and “Cognitive Neurobiology.”&lt;ref&gt;Courses from the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) [[Magdeburg]], Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group’s current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‘[[multistable perception]].’ The [[phenomenon]], described in a sentence: “Certain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, from time to time and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.”&lt;ref&gt;Research at the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) Magdeburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A final example of university commitment to cognitive biology can be found at [[Comenius University]] in Bratislava, Slovakia. There in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Bratislava Biocenter is presented as a consortium of research teams working in biomedical sciences. Their website lists the Center for Cognitive Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at the top of the page, followed by five lab groups, each at a separate  department of bioscience. The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html&lt;/ref&gt; offers a link to "Foundations of Cognitive Biology," a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kováč, the site’s founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.

== Cognitive biology as a category ==

The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ are also used together as the name of a category. The category of ''cognitive biology'' has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from ''[[cognitive science]]'', then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—[[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an [[interdisciplinary]] approach in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of [[cognitive ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Donald R. "Prospects for a cognitive ethology." Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, breakthroughs in [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cell biology|cell]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary]], and [[developmental biology]] generated a [[cornucopia]] of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were [[problematic]]. For example, the decision to append ''cognitive'' to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the [[Computational biology|computational]] and [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher-level cognition. Behavioural Processes 35: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of [[simulated]] v. [[embodied cognition|embodied]]&lt;ref&gt;Ziemke, Tom (2003). What's that thing called embodiment. In Proceedings of the 25th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1305-1310). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.
 
One solution is to consider ''cognitive biology'' only as a subset of ''cognitive science''. For example, a major publisher’s website&lt;ref&gt;[55] ''WIRES'' (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/&lt;/ref&gt; displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the ''Cognitive Science'' page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: ''Cognitive Biology'', Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the ''Cognitive Biology'' page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from [[cognitive ethology]]&lt;ref&gt;For consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), “On the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology”.&lt;/ref&gt; through [[evolutionary epistemology]]; cognition and art; [[evo-devo]] and cognitive science; [[animal learning]]; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.

A different application of the ''cognitive biology'' category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute]] for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.”&lt;ref&gt;Tommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), ''Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior.''
 
A final example of categorical use comes from an author’s introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, ''Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds''. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: “Thus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of ''cognitive biology'', which endeavors to bridge these two domains.”&lt;ref&gt;Author’s italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds.&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from [[cybernetics]] (e.g., self-regulatory systems) and [[quantum information theory]] (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation "to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.”&lt;ref&gt;Auletta (2011), p61. See also, for examples, pps 335 &amp; 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSIs that are restricted to a particular [[clade]] or group of species, generally provide good [[phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic markers]] of common evolutionary descent.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt; Due to the rarity and highly specific nature of such changes, it is less likely that they could arise independently by either [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] or [[parallel evolution]] (i.e. homoplasy) or [[synapomorphy]]. Other confounding factors such as differences in evolutionary rates at different sites or among different species also generally do not affect the interpretation of a CSI.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 2002" /&gt; By determining the presence or absence of CSIs in an out-group species, one can infer whether the ancestral form of the CSI was an insert or deletion and this can be used to develop a rooted phylogenetic relationship among organisms.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;

Most CSIs that have been identified have been found to exhibit high predictive value and they generally retain the specificity for the originally identified clades of species. Therefore, based upon their presence or absence, it should be possible to identify both known and even previously unknown species belonging to these groups in different environments.&lt;ref name="Gupta 2002" /&gt;

==Types==

=== Group specific ===
[[File:Group indel picture.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|'''Figure 1:''' Example of a group specific Conserved signature indel (CSIs), that is specific for species from taxon X. The dashes in the alignments indicate the presence of an amino acid identical to that on the top line.]]

Group specific CSIs are commonly shared by different species belonging to a particular [[Taxon]](e.g. genus, family, class, order, phylum) but they are not present in other groups. These CSIs were most likely introduced in an ancestor of the group of species before the members of the [[Taxon|taxa]] diverged. They provide molecular means for distinguishing members of a particular taxon from all other organisms.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rokas /&gt;

'''Figure 1'''  shows an example of 5aa CSI found in all species belonging to the taxon X. This is a distinctive characteristic of this taxon as it is not found in any other species. This signature was likely introduced in a common ancestor of the species from this taxon. Similarly other group-specific signatures (not shown) could be shared by either A1 and A2 or B1 and B2, etc., or even by X1 and X2 or by X3 and X4, etc. The groups A, B, C, D and X, in this diagram could correspond to various bacterial or [[Eukaryotic]] phyla.&lt;ref name="gupta web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Radhey|title=Conserved Inserts and Deletions in Protein Sequences|url=http://www.bacterialphylogeny.info/|work=Bacterial Phylogeny|publisher=Gupta RS|accessdate=2 April 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group specific CSIs have been used in the past to determine the phylogenetic relationship of a number of bacterial phyla and subgroups within it. For example a 3 amino acid insert was uniquely shared by members of the phylum [[Thermotogae]] in the essential [[ribosomal protein|50S ribosomal protein L7/L12]], within a highly conserved region (82-124 amino acid). This is not present in any other bacteria species and could be used to characterize members of the phylum [[Thermotogae]] from all other bacteria. Group specific CSIs were also used to characterize subgroups within the phylum [[Thermotogae]].&lt;ref name=vaibhav&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-011-9576-z |title=Phylogeny and molecular signatures for the phylum Thermotogae and its subgroups |year=2011 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |last2=Bhandari |first2=Vaibhav |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=100 |pages=1–34 |pmid=21503713 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi group or main-line ===

[[File:mainline indel picture.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|'''Figure 2:''' Multi group or Main-Line Conserved signature indel (CSI). The dashes in indicate the presence of an amino acid identical to that on the top line.]]

Main-line CSIs are those in which a conserved insert or deletion is shared by several major phyla, but absent from other phyla.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;

'''Figure 2''' shows an example of 5aa CSI found in a conserved region that is commonly present in the species belonging to phyla X, Y and Z, but it is absent in other phyla (A, B and C). This signature indicates a specific relationship of taxa X, Y and Z and also A, B and C. Based upon the presence or absence of such an indel, in out-group species (viz. Archaea), it can be inferred whether the indel is an insert or a deletion, and which of these two groups A, B, C or X, Y, Z is ancestral.&lt;ref name="gupta web" /&gt;

Main-line CSIs have been used in the past to determine the phylogenetic relationship of a number of bacterial phyla. The large CSI of about 150-180 amino acids within a conserved region of [[Type II topoisomerase|Gyrase B]] (between amino acids 529-751), is commonly shared between various [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chlamydiales]], [[Planctomycetes]] and [[Aquificae|Aquificales]] species. This CSI is absent in other ancestral bacterial phyla as well as [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name="gyr B"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1099/mic.0.2007/009118-0 |title=Phylogeny and shared conserved inserts in proteins provide evidence that Verrucomicrobia are the closest known free-living relatives of chlamydiae |year=2007 |last1=Griffiths |first1=E. |last2=Gupta |first2=R. S. |journal=Microbiology |volume=153 |issue=8 |pmid=17660429 |pages=2648–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a large CSI of about 100 amino acids in [[RpoB]] homologs (between amino acids 919-1058) is present in various species belonging to [[Proteobacteria]],  [[Chlorobium|Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi]], [[Chlamydiales]], [[Planctomycetes]] and [[Aquificae|Aquificales]]. This CSI is absent in other ancestral bacterial phyla as well as [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name="rpo gupta"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1024999314839 |year=2003 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=76 |pages=173–83 |pmid=16228576 |title=Evolutionary relationships among photosynthetic bacteria |issue=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rpo griffiths"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15179606 |year=2004 |last1=Griffiths |first1=Emma |last2=Gupta |first2=Radhey S. |title=Signature sequences in diverse proteins provide evidence for the late divergence of the Order ''Aquificales'' |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–52 |journal=International Microbiology |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/25march04/07%20Griffiths.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases one can infer that the groups lacking the CSI are ancestral.

== Evolutionary studies based on CSIs ==

A key issue in bacterial phylogeny is to understand how different bacterial species are related to each other and their branching order from a common ancestor. Currently most phylogenetic trees are based on [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] or other genes/proteins. These trees are not always able to resolve key phylogenetic questions with a high degree of certainty.&lt;ref name="tree 1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/90129 |year=2001 |last1=Brown |first1=James R. |last2=Douady |first2=Christophe J. |last3=Italia |first3=Michael J. |last4=Marshall |first4=William E. |last5=Stanhope |first5=Michael J. |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=281–5 |pmid=11431701 |title=Universal trees based on large combined protein sequence data sets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tree 2"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11837318 |year=2002 |last1=Cavalier-Smith |first1=T |title=The neomuran origin of archaebacteria, the negibacterial root of the universal tree and bacterial megaclassification |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–76 |doi=10.1099/00207713-52-1-7|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11837318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tree 3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1123061 |title=Toward Automatic Reconstruction of a Highly Resolved Tree of Life |year=2006 |last1=Ciccarelli |first1=F.

The genetic events leading to them are postulated to have occurred at important evolutionary branch points and their species distribution patterns provide valuable information regarding the branching order and interrelationships among different bacterial phyla.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name=vaibhav /&gt;

=== Thermotogae ===

Recently the phylogenetic relationship of the group [[Thermotogae]] was characterized based on the CSI approach. Previously no biochemical or [[molecular markers]] were known that could clearly distinguish the species of this phylum from all other bacteria. More than 60 CSIs that were specific for the entire Thermotogae phylum or its different subgroups were discovered. 18 CSIs are uniquely present in various Thermotogae species and provide molecular markers for the phylum. Additionally there were many CSIs that were specific for various thermotogae subgroups. 12 CSIs were specific for a clade consisting of various Thermotoga species except Tt. Lettingae. 14CSIs were specific for a clade consisting of the Fervidobacterium and Thermosipho genera and 18 CSIs were specific for the genus Thermosiphon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Lastly 16 CSIs were reported that were shared by either some or all Thermotogae species or some species from other taxa such as [[Archaea]], [[Aquificae]], [[Firmicutes]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Deinococcus]], [[Fusobacteria]], [[Dictyoglomus]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] and [[eukaryotes]]. The shared presence of some of these CSIs could be due to [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer (LGT)]] between these groups. However the number of CSIs that are commonly shared with other taxa is much smaller than those that are specific for Thermotogae and they do not exhibit any specific pattern. Hence they have no significant effect on the distinction of Thermotogae.&lt;ref name=vaibhav /&gt;

=== Archaea ===
Mesophillic [[Crenarchaeotes]] were recently placed into a new phylum of [[Archaea]] called the [[Thaumarchaeota]]. However there are very few molecular markers that can distinguish this group of archaea from the phylum Crenarchaeota. A detailed phylogenetic study using the CSI approach was conducted to distinguish these phyla in molecular terms. 6 CSIs were uniquely found in various Thaumarchaeota, namely ''[[Cenarchaeum symbiosum]]'', ''[[Nitrosopumilus maritimus]]'' and a number of uncultured marine crenarchaeotes. 3 CSIs were found that were commonly shared between species belonging to Thaumarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Additionally, a number of CSIs were found that are specific for different orders of  Crenarchaeota- 3 CSIs for [[Sulfolobales]], 5 CSIs for [[Thermoproteales]], lastly 2 CSIs common for [[Sulfolobales]] and [[Desulfurococcales]]. The signatures described provide novel means for distinguishing Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, additionally they could be used as a tool for the classification and identification of related species.&lt;ref name="Ali shami"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-010-9488-3 |title=Molecular signatures for the Crenarchaeota and the Thaumarchaeota |year=2010 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |last2=Shami |first2=Ali |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=133–57 |pmid=20711675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pasteurellales ===

The members of the order [[Pasteurellales]] are currently distinguished mainly based on their position in the branching of the 16srRNA tree. There are currently very few molecular markers known that can distinguish members of this order from other bacteria. A CSI approach was recently used to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between the species in this order; more than 40 CSIs were discovered that were uniquely shared by all or most of the species. Two major clades are formed within this Pasteurellales: Clade I, encompassing [[Aggregatibacter]], [[Pasteurella]], Actinobacillus succinogenes, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, [[Haemophilus influenzae]] and Haemophilus somnus, was supported by 13 CSIs. Clade II, encompassing Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus minor, [[Haemophilus ducreyi]], Mannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus parasuis, was supported by 9 CSIs. Based on these results, it was proposed that Pasteurellales be divided from its current one family into two different ones. Additionally, the signatures described would provide novel means of identifying undiscovered Pasteurellales species.&lt;ref name="sohail new"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-011-9628-4 |title=Molecular signatures (conserved indels) in protein sequences that are specific for the order Pasteurellales and distinguish two of its main clades |year=2011 |last1=Naushad |first1=Hafiz Sohail |last2=Gupta |first2=Radhey S. |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=101 |pages=105–24 |pmid=21830122 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gammaproteobacteria ===
The class [[Gammaproteobacteria]] forms one of the largest groups of bacteria. It is currently distinguished from other bacteria solely by [[16s rRNA]]-based phylogenetic trees. No molecular characteristics unique to the class or its different subgroups are known. A detailed CSI-based study was conducted to better understand the phylogeny of this class. Firstly, a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of a number of universally-distributed proteins was created. The branching order of the different [[Order (biology)|orders]] of the [[Class (biology)|class]] Gammaproteobacteria (from most recent to the earliest diverging) was: [[Enterobacteriales]] &gt;[[Pasteurellales]] &gt;[[Vibrionales]], [[Aeromonadales]] &gt;[[Alteromonadales]] &gt;[[Oceanospirillales]], [[Pseudomonadales]] &gt;[[Chromatiales]], [[Legionellales]], [[Methylococcales]], [[Xanthomonadales]], [[Cardiobacteriales]], [[Thiotrichales]]. Additionally, 4 CSIs were discovered that were unique to most species of the class Gammaproteobacteria. A 2 aa deletion in [[Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase|AICAR transformylase]] was uniquely shared by all gammaproteobacteria except for [[Francisella tularensis]]. A 4 aa deletion in [[RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase b-subunit]] and a 1 aa deletion in [[Ribosomal protein|ribosomal protein L16]]  were found uniquely in various species belonging to the orders [[Enterobacteriales]], [[Pasteurellales]], [[Vibrionales]], [[Aeromonadales]] and [[Alteromonadales]], but were not found in other gammaproteobacteria. Lastly, a 2 aa deletion in [[leucyl-tRNA synthetase]] was commonly present in the above orders of the class Gammaproteobacteria and in some members of the order [[Oceanospirillales]].&lt;ref name="Gupta Xantha"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.002741-0 |title=Phylogenomics and protein signatures elucidating the evolutionary relationships among the Gammaproteobacteria |year=2009 |last1=Gao |first1=B. |last2=Mohan |first2=R. |last3=Gupta |first3=R. S. |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pmid=19196760 |pages=234–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another CSI based study has also identified 4 CSIs that are exclusive to the order Xanthomonadales. Taken together, these two facts show that Xanthomonadales is a [[Monophyly|monophyletic group]] that is ancestral to other Gammaproteobacteria, which further shows that Xanthomonadales is an independent subdivision, and constitutes one of the deepest-branching lineages within the Gammaproteobacteria clade.&lt;ref name=Cutino-Jimenez /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta Xantha" /&gt;

=== Fungi ===
The exact phylogenetic relationship between [[plants]], [[animals]] and [[fungi]] is not well understood. A small CSI-based study was conducted to elucidate this relationship. Four CSIs were used to place animals and fungi together as a monophyletic group, and exclude plants. These CSIs were found in two essential cellular proteins, [[Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1|elongation factor l]] and [[enolase]]. However, traditionally, this specific relationship between fungi and animals has not been supported.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1530">The '''disturbance storm time''' ('''Dst''', '''Kyoto Dst''') index is a measure in the context of [[space weather]]. It gives information about the strength of the [[ring current]] around Earth caused by solar protons and electrons.&lt;ref name=WU-JM&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=A future Space Weather catastrophe : a disturbing possibility|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/a-future-space-weather-catastrophe--a-disturbing-possibility.html|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ring current around Earth produces a magnetic field that is directly opposite Earth's magnetic field, i.e. if the difference between solar electrons and protons gets higher, then Earth's magnetic field becomes weaker.

A negative Dst value means that Earth's magnetic field is weakened. This is particularly the case during solar storms.

The '''Doctor of Architecture''' (D Arch) degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/school-view/?record_id=20569&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture/accredited-programs&lt;/ref&gt; The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/info/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional  graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.

Currently, the only University in the United States offering a Doctor of Architecture degree is the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. The Doctorate of Architecture was first accredited by NAAB in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the University of Hawaii program is open to students who have completed high school, transfer students who have completed some college-level work, and students who have completed Baccalaureate or advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the degree requires 120 undergraduate credits and 90 graduate credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor E.A. Westermarck, c1930s.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Westermarck]]
'''Edvard Alexander Westermarck''' (20 November 1862 &amp;ndash; 3 September 1939) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]]. Among other subjects, he studied [[exogamy]] and the [[incest taboo]].

The phenomenon of reverse sexual imprinting is when two people live in close domestic proximity during the first few years in the life of either one, and both become desensitised to sexual attraction, now known as the [[Westermarck effect]], was first formally described by him in his book ''[[The History of Human Marriage]]'' (1891). 

He has been described as "first [[Darwinian]] sociologist" or "the first [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]]".&lt;ref name=sanderson&gt;Sanderson, SK. "REFORMING THEORETICAL WORK IN SOCIOLOGY: A DETAILED REPLY TO MY CRITICS"&lt;/ref&gt; 

He helped found academic [[sociology]] in the United Kingdom, becoming the first professor of sociology (with [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]) in 1907 in the [[University of London]]. Other chairs he held were in Helsinki and Turku. 

A radical free thinker for his time, he critiqued Christian institutions and Christian ideas on the grounds that they lacked foundation. 

In the UK, his name is often spelled '''Edward'''. His sister, [[Helena Westermarck]], was a writer and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Petteys | first = Chris | title = Dictionary of women artists : an international dictionary of women artists born before 1900 | publisher = G.K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12863">'''Endophenotype''' is a [[genetic epidemiology]] term which is used to separate behavioral [[symptom]]s into more stable [[phenotypes]] with a clear [[genetics|genetic]] connection. The concept was coined by Bernard John and Kenneth R. Lewis in a 1966 paper attempting to explain the [[population distribution|geographic distribution]] of [[grasshopper]]s. They claimed that the particular geographic distribution could not be explained by the obvious and external "exophenotype" of the grasshoppers, but instead must be explained by their microscopic and internal "endophenotype".&lt;ref name="Bernard et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=John|first=Bernard|author2=Kenneth R. Lewis|title=Chromosome Variability and Geographic Distribution in Insects|journal=Science|year=1966|doi=10.1126/science.152.3723.711|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/152/3723/711.extract?sid=7fdb3c88-529a-4058-89e1-44543b82b14a|accessdate=22 April 2012|volume=152|pages=711–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major use of the term was in [[psychiatric genetics]], to bridge the gap between high-level symptom presentation and low-level genetic variability, such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid12668349&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gottesman|first1=Irving |last2=Gould|first2=Todd |title=The Endophenotype Concept in Psychiatry: Etymology and Strategic Intentions |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |date=April 2003 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.636 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |pmid=12668349 |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=636–45 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12668349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore more applicable to more heritable disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Greenwood et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Tiffany|title=Initial Heritability Analyses of Endophenotypic Measures for Schizophrenia|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|year=2007|pmid=17984393|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/64/11/1242|accessdate=22 April 2012|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.11.1242|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1242–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the concept has expanded to many other fields, such as the study of [[ADHD]],&lt;ref name =Alderson2010&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alderson | first1 = R.M. | last2 = Rapport | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Hudec | first3 = K.L. | last4 = Sarver | first4 = D.E. | last5 = Kofler | first5 = M.J. | year = 2010 | title = Competing core processes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Do working memory deficiencies underlie behavioral inhibition deficits? | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 497–507 | doi=10.1007/s10802-010-9387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[addiction]],&lt;ref name=Ersche2012&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karen D.

==Definition==
In psychiatry research, the accepted criteria which a biomarker must fulfill to be called an endophenotype include:&lt;ref name=pmid12668349/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gershon ES, Goldin LR | year = 1986 | title = Clinical methods in psychiatric genetics, I: robustness of genetic marker investigative strategies | pmid=3465198 | journal = [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] | volume = 74 | issue = 2| pages = 113–118 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb10594.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beauchaine, TP | year = 2009 | title = The role of biomarkers and endophenotypes in prevention and treatment of psychopathological disorders | journal = [[Biomarkers in Medicine]] | volume = 3 | pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.2009.00509.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# An endophenotype must segregate with illness in the population.
# An endophenotype must be heritable.
# An endophenotype must not be state-dependent (i.e., manifests whether illness is active or in remission).
# An endophenotype must co-segregate with illness within families.
# An endophenotype must be present at a higher rate within affected families than in the population. 
# An endophenotype must be amenable to reliable measurement, and be specific to the illness of interest.

==For schizophrenia==
In the case of [[schizophrenia]], the overt symptom could be a [[psychosis]], but the underlying phenotypes are, for example, a lack of [[sensory gating]] and a decline in [[working memory]]. Both of these traits have a clear genetic component and can thus be called endophenotypes.&lt;ref name=pmid12668349/&gt; A strong candidate for schizophrenia endophenotype is [[prepulse inhibition]], the ability to inhibit the reaction to startling stimuli.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Endophenotypes are quantitative, trait-like deficits that are typically assessed by laboratory-based methods rather than by clinical observation.

The four primary criteria for an endophenotype are that it is present in [[probands]] with the disorder, that it is not state-related (that is, it does not occur only during clinical episodes) but instead is present early in the disease course and during periods of remission, that it is observed in unaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population, and that it is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael|last2=Horan|first2=William|last3=Lee|first3=Junghee|date=October 2015|title=Social cognition in schizophrenia|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn4005|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=16|pages=620–631|doi=10.1038/nrn4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some distinct genes that could underlie certain endophenotypic traits in schizophrenia include:
* [[reelin|RELN]] – coding the reelin protein downregulated in patients' brains. In one 2008 study its variants were associated with performance in verbal and visual working memory tests in the nuclear families of the sufferers.&lt;ref name=pmid17684500&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wedenoja J, Loukola A, Tuulio-Henriksson A, Paunio T, Ekelund J, Silander K, Varilo T, Heikkilä K, Suvisaari J, Partonen T, Lönnqvist J, Peltonen L |title=Replication of linkage on chromosome 7q22 and association of the regional Reelin gene with working memory in schizophrenia families |journal=[[Mol. Psychiatry]] |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=673–84 |date=July 2008 |pmid=17684500 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4002047}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FABP7]], coding the ''Fatty acid-binding protein 7 (brain)'', one SNP of which was associated with schizophrenia in one 2008 study,&lt;ref name=pmid18001149/&gt; is also linked to [[prepulse inhibition]] in mice.&lt;ref name=pmid18001149&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe A, Toyota T, Owada Y |title=Fabp7 maps to a quantitative trait locus for a schizophrenia endophenotype |journal=[[PLoS Biol.]] |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=e297 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18001149 |pmc=2071943 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050297 |url= http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050297|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still uncertain though whether the finding will be replicated for human patients.
* [[CHRNA7]], coding the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit. alpha7-containing receptors are known to improve prepulse inhibition, pre-attentive and attentive states.&lt;ref name=pmid19351547&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leiser SC, Bowlby MR, Comery TA, Dunlop J |title=A cog in cognition: How the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is geared towards improving cognitive deficits |journal=[[Pharmacology and Therapeutics]] |volume=122 |pages=302–11 |year=2009 |pmid=19351547 |doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.03.009 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For bipolar disorder==
In [[bipolar disorder]], one commonly identified endophenotype is a deficit in [[face perception|face emotion labeling]], which is found in both individuals with bipolar disorder and in individuals who are "at risk" (i.e., have a first degree relative with bipolar disorder).&lt;ref name="Brotman 2008"/&gt;  Using [[fMRI]], this endophenotype has been linked to dysfunction in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[striatum]], and [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=H|title=Neurocognitive correlates of emotional stimulus processing in pediatric bipolar disorder: a review.|journal=Postgrad Med|year=2010|pmid=20675973|doi=10.3810/pgm.2010.07.2177|volume=122|issue=4|pages=94–104}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A polymorphism in the ''CACNA1C'' gene coding for the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]] [[Cav1.2|Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2]] has been found to be associated with deficits in facial emotion recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soeiro-de-Souza|first=Marcio|title=The impact of the CACNA1C risk allele on limbic structures and facial emotions recognition in bipolardisorder subjects and healthy controls|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.014|volume=141|pages=94–101|pmid=22464935}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==For suicide==
The endophenotype concept has also been used in [[suicide]] studies. Personality characteristics can be viewed as endophenotypes that may exert a [[Diathesis–stress model|diathesis]] effect on an individual's susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Although the exact identification of these endophenotypes is controversial, certain traits such as impulsivity and aggression are commonly cited risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwivedi|first=Y|title=The Neurobiological Basis of Suicide|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK107203/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One such genetic basis for one of these at-risk endophenotypes has been suggested in 2007 to be the gene coding for the [[serotonin]] receptor [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT]]&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;, known to be relevant in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=pmid17510950&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zouk H, McGirr A, Lebel V, Benkelfat C, Rouleau G, Turecki G |title=The effect of genetic variation of the serotonin 1B receptor gene on impulsive aggressive behavior and suicide |journal=[[Am. J. Med. Genet. B Neuropsychiatr. Genet.]] |volume=144B |issue=8 |pages=996–1002 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17510950 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.b.30521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endophysics''' literally means “[[physics]] from within”. It is the study of how the observations are affected and limited by the observer being within the universe. This is in contrast with the common '''exophysics''' assumption of a system observed from the “outside”. The term ''endophysics'' has been coined by [[David Finkelstein]] in a letter to the founder of the field [[Otto E. Rössler]].

Recently, several other assays of protein stability based on proteolysis have been proposed, exploiting other proteases with high specificity for cleaving unfolded proteins. These include Pulse Proteolysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FASTpp.

== How it works ==

FASTpp measures the quantity of protein that resists digestion under various conditions. To this end, a thermostable protease is used, which cleaves specifically at exposed [[hydrophobicity|hydrophobic]] residues. The FASTpp assay combines the thermal unfolding, specificity of a thermostable protease for the unfolded fraction with the separation power of [[SDS-PAGE]].&lt;ref name="pmid5432063"&gt;{{Cite journal

| volume = 227 
| issue = 5259 
| pages = 680–685 
| year = 1970 
| pmid = 5432063
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this combination, FASTpp can detect changes in the fraction folded over a large physico-chemical range of conditions including temperatures up to 85&amp;nbsp;°C, [[pH]] 6-9, presence or absence of the whole [[proteome]]. Applications range from [[biotechnology]] to study of [[point mutations]] and [[ligand binding assay]]s.

== Technology ==

First, a cell lysate is generated by glass beads beating, pressure homogenisation or chemical or physical lysis methods that do not denature the protein(s) of interest. (Optionally for targeted analysis) a protein of interest is purified out of this lysate by affinity methods based on intrinsically disordered tags &lt;ref name="Designing disorder"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28516025|year=2013|last1=Minde|first1=DP|last2=Halff|first2=EF|last3=Tans|first3=SJ|

This (total or purified) protein solution is aliquoted into several tubes of a PCR strip. All aliquots are exposed in parallel in a thermal gradient PCR cycler to different maximal temperatures in presence of the thermostable protease thermolysin (see figure). 
Automated temperature control is achieved in a thermal gradient cycler (commonly used for [[PCR]]s). Reaction products can be separated by [[SDS-PAGE]] or [[western blot]].&lt;ref name="pmid5432063"/&gt;  The protease thermolysin can be fully inactivated by [[EDTA]]. This feature of [[thermolysin]] makes FASTpp compatible with subsequent [[trypsin]] digestion e.g. for [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=Proteomics&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22733688|year=2012|last1=Chang|first1=Y|last2=Schlebach|first2=JP|last3=Verheul|first3=RA|last4=Park|first4=C|title=Simplified proteomics approach to discover protein-ligand interactions|volume=21|issue=9|pages=1280–7|doi=10.1002/pro.2112|journal=Protein Science|pmc=3631357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulse Proteolysis NM"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15782190|year=2005|last1=Park|first1=C|last2=Marqusee|first2=S|title=Pulse proteolysis: A simple method for quantitative determination of protein stability and ligand binding|volume=2|issue=3|pages=207–12|doi=10.1038/nmeth740|journal=Nature Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">As defined by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], '''geo-literacy''' is "the ability to use [[geographic]] understanding and geographic reasoning to make decisions".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416071705/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/geoliteracy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |archivedate=April 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "geo-literacy" arose from the National Geographic Society's "Fight against Geographic Illiteracy." The organization released various media to help explain the concept to the general public. In an editorial, Daniel C. Edelson, vice president for education at National Geographic, said, "The National Geographic Society's concern for geo-literacy comes from our mission. We see geo-literacy as providing the tools that will enable communities to protect [[natural resource|natural]] and cultural resources, reduce violent [[Armed conflict|conflict]], and improve the [[quality of life]] worldwide. However, having a geo-literate populace is also critical for maintaining [[Competition (economics)|economic competitiveness]], quality of life, and national security in our modern, interconnected world.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geography.about.com/b/2012/05/13/geo-literacy.htm | title=Geo-Literacy | publisher=About.com | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | author=Rosenberg, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have released various media to help explain it to the general public.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt; In addition, the National Geographic Society set up the Fund for Geo-literacy, in which donations help fund the printing of materials for education, professional development for the educators, and programs to help build awareness of the importance of geo-literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1&amp;force_AR=True |title=Fund for Geo-Literacy |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130105/http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/program/fund-for-geo-literacy/?ar_a=1 |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
According to Edelson, the 3 components of geo-literacy are:&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;
* Interactions-Understanding of human and natural systems
* Interconnections-Geographic reasoning
* Implications-Systematic decision-making

==Educational activities==
"Kid World Citizen", a site which provides "multicultural, educational activities to teach...kids about the world", and who, listed the following "age-appropriate lessons to increase geo-literacy in primary school students":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kidworldcitizen.org/2012/05/13/what-is-geo-literacy/ | title=What is Geo-Literacy? | publisher=Kid World Citizen | date=May 13, 2012 | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Explore different homes around the world and guess why the types of home fit their environment
* Discover why certain cultures celebrate certain holidays, and what is important to them
* Investigate different [[habitats]] and [[biomes]], such as the [[rainforest]]; look at tangible ways kids can prevent their destruction
* Surround kids with geography: study maps, [[cartography|create maps]], follow maps, play with maps. The more you develop their spatial intelligence when they’re younger, the more kids will understand their place in this world.
* Learn about the [[water cycle]] and the conserving and managing our freshwater resources
* Research your child’s favorite animal, turning it into a global lesson about protecting their habitat and food sources; what decisions can we make that will affect the outcome of this animal?

==Research Studies and Education Projects==
In 2012, InTeGrate ("a community effort to improve geoscience literacy and build a workforce that can make use of geoscience to solve societal issues") held a Module Author Meeting from May 16–18 on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/info_team_members/meetings/geo_lit_agenda.html | title=Module Author Meeting Agenda | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier Uses of the Term "geo-literacy"==

In 2002, Robert E. Nolan of the [[Education Resources Information Center]] published a research report/journal article entitled "Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live", which included  "a test of physical and geopolitical geography...completed by 321 adults". The years of formal education and age were correlated with geographic literacy, and informal learning, such as travel, reading, media, was used as the primary source of geographic knowledge for those with higher educational attainment. A notable finding was that women, regardless of education level, scored significantly lower than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ658647&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ658647 | title=Geo-Literacy: How Well Adults Understand the World in Which They Live | accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Arizona Geographic Information Council|Arizona Geographic Alliance]] launched a project called "The GeoLiteracy Project" that integrated geography education into reading and writing instruction.  In this case, their term "GeoLiteracy" referred to the integration of geography and traditional language arts literacy. 

In 1997, Linda Ferguson and Eva LaMar established an educational project they called "The Geo-Literacy Project".  LaMar describes geo-literacy as "the use of visual learning and communication tools to build an in-depth understanding -- or literacy -- of geography, [[geology]], and local [[history]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Ashley|title=Geo-Literacy: Using Technology to Forge New Ground|url=http://www.edutopia.org/geo-literacy-forging-new-ground|work=Edutopia|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

{{News release|date=May 2012}}
'''Greenhouse debt''' is the measure to which an individual person, incorporated association, business enterprise, government instrumentality or / [and] (per Neb., USA) geographic community exceeds its permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]] and contributes [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The concept makes no sense without a clear numerical value for the permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]]. It is not clear what this value is.

[[Friends of the Earth]] and similar organisations put forward the concept to define specifically the environmental harm caused by developed countries' past and present policies.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International. 2000. "Greenhouse debt".  ''Link'' (20):  http://www.foei.org/en/publications/link/92/e92greenhouse_debt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments, at least the Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, have a tendency to accept such a line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Hamilton, "We will all pay for Howard's hidden greenhouse debt", Crikey, Friday, 14 December 2007: http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20071214-Howards-Hidden-Greenhouse-Debt-.html?CurrentDate=14+%2F+01+%2F+2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenhouse debt assessment thus forms an [[ecological footprint]] analysis but can be used separately. Taken conjointly with a 'water debt' [[needs assessment|analysis]] and an [[environmental impact assessment|ecological impact assessment]], greenhouse debt analysis is basic to giving individuals, organisations, governments and communities an understanding of the effects they are having on [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], [[life]], and [[global warming]].  

Ensuring that the greenhouse debt is zero is essential towards achieving [[ecologically sustainable development]] or a [[sustainable retreat]]. Any greenhouse debt incurred will contribute to making life harder for future generations of humans and [[non-human]] lifeforms.

There are three possible consequences that occur as a result of a greenhouse debt.

#''[[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]]:'' finding compensatory ways of reducing the greenhouse debt so its effects are neutralised
#''[[Adaptation]]:'' finding ways of adjusting to the resulting global warming or climate change
#''[[Suffering]]:'' having one's quality of life reduced as a result of the consequences

'''Infant crying''' is the crying of infants as a response to an internal or external [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEsyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=Infants+cry+as+a+form+of+basic+instinctive+communication#v=onepage&amp;q=Infants%20cry%20as%20a%20form%20of%20basic%20instinctive%20communication&amp;f=false|title=The Calm and Happy Toddler: Gentle Solutions to Tantrums, Night Waking, Potty Training and More|last=Chicot|first=Dr Rebecca|date=2015-12-03|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473527591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, [[newborn]]s are transitioning from life in the [[womb]] to the external environment.{{sfn | Walker| page = 210}} Up to 27% of parents describe problems with infant crying in the first four months. Up to 38% identify a problem with their infant crying within the first year.

==Physiology==
Crying may elicit the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva reflex]]. This reflex negatively impacts [[breastfeeding|sucking]] [[Suction|pressure]]s and results in poor feeding. The [[cortisol]] levels will rise along with [[blood pressure]]. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on [[cerebral blood flow]], [[cerebral blood flow velocity]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to [[intracranial hemmorrhage]]. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some [[adverse effect]]s. Obstructed [[venous return]] and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Foramen ovale]] shunting can occur.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify [[anger]] or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

==Misconceptions==
Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel. These are usually determined by cultural mores and not by [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] explanations. The crying of an infant is regarded by some to be normal and good.&lt;ref name = roberts&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0815/p735.html|title=Infantile Colic|first1=Donna M.|last1=Roberts|first2=Michael|last2=Ostapchuk|first3=Jmes G.|last3=O'Brien|date=15 August 2004|journal=American Family Physician|volume=70|issue=4|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It's OK to be a cry baby at bedtime, study says."

Accessed 23 Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that infants have a need to cry to expand or exercise their lungs is not supported by research. This is because a healthy newborn infant lung's are able to contain a sufficient amount of air plus a reserve.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Birth trauma is related to the amount of crying.

===Colic===
{{Main|Colic}}
The term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: " crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy."&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt; Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians.&lt;ref name=Gri2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimes|first1=edited by Frank Domino, Robert A.

Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/1001/p577.html|last1=Johnson|first1=JD|last2=Cocker|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=E|title=Infantile Colic: Recognition and Treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 October 2015 |accessdate = 22 July 2017| volume=92|issue=7|pages=577–82|pmid=26447441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hu&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems|first1=J.|last1=Petzoldt|first2=H.-U.|last2=Wittchen|first3=F.|last3=Einsle|first4=J.|last4=Martini|date=1 March 2016|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=42|issue=2|pages=231–245|doi=10.1111/cch.12292|pmid=26490836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Fallon|last2=Seymour|first2=Monique|last3=Giallo|first3=Rebecca|last4=Cann|first4=Warren|last5=Nicholson|first5=Jan M.|last6=Green|first6=Julie|last7=Hiscock|first7=Harriet|title=Comparison of methods for recruiting and engaging parents in online interventions: study protocol for the Cry Baby infant sleep and settling program|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=174|year=2015|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0502-9|pmid=26556032|pmc=4640160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal "physical aggression" and "angry speaking". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt; During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both.&lt;ref name = hu/&gt; Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.&lt;ref name=Ia2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iacovou|first=M|author2=Ralston, RA |author3=Muir, J |author4=Walker, KZ |author5= Truby, H |title=Dietary management of infantile colic: a systematic review.|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=August 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1319–31|pmid=21710185|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on young children==
One definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;

==Abuse==
{{Main|Abusive head trauma}}

===Normal crying===
The physical abuse of infants is related to crying.&lt;ref name = reij&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant crying and abuse|first1=Sijmen A.|last1=Reijneveld|first2=Marcel F.|last2=van der Wal|first3=Emily|last3=Brugman|first4=Remy A.

This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parents' behavior in response to infant crying: Abusive head trauma education|first1=Hina|last1=Simonnet|first2=Anne|last2=Laurent-Vannier|first3=Wenlun|last3=Yuan|first4=Marie|last4=Hully|first5=Sakil|last5=Valimahomed|first6=Malek|last6=Bourennane|first7=Mathilde|last7=Chevignard|date=1 December 2014|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1914–1922|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.06.002|pmid=25043922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Infant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to  put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked  every 5 to 10 minutes. 
Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "normal" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: 
* Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers
* Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants
* Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants
* Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt;

Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.

The '''''kaige'' revision''', or simply '''''kaige''''', is shorthand for the ensemble of revisions to the [[Septuagint]] made in order to more closely align its translation with the [[Masoretic Text|proto-Masoretic]] [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dines|first=Jennifer Mary|title=The Septuagint: Understanding the Bible and Its World|year=2004|publisher=A&amp;C Black|location=London|isbn=9780567084644|page=81-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''kaige'' derives from the revision's pervasive use of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''kai ge'' ("and indeed") to translate the Hebrew "''we gam''" ("and also"). The importance of this revision lies in its status as a precursor to later revisions by 'the Three' (i.e., [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] and [[Theodotion]]) as well as the light it sheds on the origins of the Septuagint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Timothy Michael|title=When God Spoke Greek: The Septuagint and the Making of the Christian Bible|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199344338|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The individual revisions characteristic of ''kaige'' were first observed by [[Dominique Barthélemy]] in the [[Greek Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tov|first=Emanuel|title=Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible|year=2011|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781451403299|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft''' was established in 2004 at the Department of [[nanotechnology|NanoScience]], Faculty of Applied Sciences, [[Delft University of Technology]] through a grant by the US-based [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]].&lt;ref name="kavli"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home - Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/|website=Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kavli Institute of Nanoscience has a staff of 35 professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People - Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/people/|website=kavli.tudelft.nl|accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in [[de Volkskrant]], a Dutch national newspaper in 2012, claimed that four of the ten most cited scientists in the Netherlands belong to the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Calmthout|first=Martijn|date=October 27, 2012|title=Topwetenschapper is natuurkundige of arts|journal=[[de Volkskrant]]|page=9|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1665">A '''leaf scar''' is the mark left by a [[leaf]] after it falls off the twig. It marks the site where the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] attached to the [[Plant stem|stem]]. A leaf scar is typically found below a branch as branches come from [[axillary bud]]s located above leaf scars.[[File:20150228Ailanthus altissima1.jpg|thumb|The leaf scar on [[Ailanthus altissima]]]]

==Formation==
Leaf scars are formed naturally, often at the end of the growing season for [[deciduous]] plants when a layer of cells called the abscissa layer forms between the petiole and stem.  The [[abscission]] layer acts as a point of cleavage and the leaf breaks off leaving a cleanly shaped wound that is quickly healed over with protective cork. [[Stipule]]s may also leave their own scars if they are present.&lt;ref name=osu&gt;{{cite web|title=Winter twigs|url=http://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/winter-twigs/intro|website=Oregon state university|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bundle scars==
Bundle scars are circular or barred regions within the leaf scar where bundles of vascular tissue that had connected the leaf and the stem broke off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dirr|first1=Michael Illustrations by Bonnie Dirr|title=Manual of woody landscape plants.|date=1990|location=[S.l.|isbn=0-87563-344-7|edition=4. ed., rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bundle scars in a leaf scar is sometimes used as an identifying mark as they are often consistent across a species.

'''Musical symbols''' are the marks and symbols, used since about the 13th century in the [[musical notation]] of musical scores, styles, and instruments to describe [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], [[tempo]] and, to some degree, its [[articulation (music)|articulation]] (a composition in its fundamentals).

==Lines==
{| style="vertical-align: middle     ;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word "stave" is often used.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''&lt;br /&gt; These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''&lt;br /&gt;These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]].  Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as keyboard, harp, and conductor scores, but are omitted for other types of music, such as vocal scores.
|-
| width=12.5%''' | [[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]
|'''Double bar line, Double barline'''&lt;br /&gt;These separate two sections of music or are placed before a change in [[key signature]].
|-
| width=12.5%''' |&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-endbar.svg|100px]]
|'''Bold double bar line, Bold double barline'''&lt;br /&gt;These indicate the conclusion of a movement or an entire composition.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-dottedbar.svg|100px]]
|'''Dotted bar line, Dotted barline'''&lt;br /&gt;Subdivides long measures of complex meter into shorter segments for ease of reading, usually according to natural rhythmic subdivisions.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Staff-bracket.jpg|20px]]
|'''Bracket'''&lt;br /&gt;Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously.  In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]
|'''Brace'''&lt;br /&gt;Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+007B U+007B left curly bracket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121802/http://www.decodeunicode.org/u%2B007B |date=2008-12-02 }} at decodeunicode.org; retrieved on May 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an "accolade" in some old texts) varies in design and style.
|}

== Clefs ==
{{main|Clef}}
Clefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''&lt;br /&gt;The centre of the spiral defines the line on which it rests as the pitch G above middle C.&lt;ref name=Gerou1996&gt;{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |location=USA |publisher=Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. |isbn=0-88284-768-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positioned here, it assigns G above middle C to the ''second line from the bottom'' of the staff, and is referred to as the "treble clef". This is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. The shape of the clef comes from a stylised upper-case-G.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''&lt;br /&gt;These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the "alto clef". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a "movable" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a "tenor clef". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.&lt;br /&gt; Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''&lt;br /&gt;The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.&lt;ref name=Gerou1996/&gt; Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a "bass clef". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here.  In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.  The shape of the clef comes from a stylised upper-case-F (which used to be written the reverse of the modern F)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]
|'''Neutral clef'''&lt;br /&gt;Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]
|'''Octave clef'''&lt;br /&gt;Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]
|'''Tablature'''&lt;br /&gt;For stringed instruments it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.

== Notes and rests ==

{{main|Note value}}
[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values. The whole note is the reference value, and the other notes are named (in American usage) in comparison; i.e., a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a whole note.

|'''[[Beam (music)|Beamed notes]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Beams connect eighth notes (quavers) and notes of shorter value and are equivalent in value to flags. In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text – [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.

| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Dotted note]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' × (2 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''−n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Ghost note.png]]
|'''[[Ghost note]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played.  It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation. Also called ''gathered rest'' or ''multi-bar rest''.
|}

Durations shorter than the 64th are rare but not unknown. [[Hundred twenty-eighth note|128th notes]] are used by many composers, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]; [[256th note]]s occur in works by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven. An extreme case is the Toccata Grande Cromatica by early-19th-century American composer [[Anthony Philip Heinrich]], which uses note values as short as 2,048ths; however, the context shows clearly that these notes have one beam more than intended, so they should really be 1,024th notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm |title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation |last=Byrd |first=Donald |date=16 December 2014 |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of very short notes can be formed as {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 2&lt;/sup&gt;th}} note, where ''n'' is the number of flags on the note.

== Breaks ==
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-breath.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Breath mark]]'''&lt;br /&gt;In a score, this symbol tells the performer to take a breath (or make a slight pause for non-wind instruments). This pause usually does not affect the overall tempo. For bowed instruments, it indicates to lift the bow and play the next note with a downward (or upward, if marked) bow.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-caesura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Caesura]]''' &lt;br /&gt;Indicates a brief, silent pause, during which time is not counted. In ensemble playing, time resumes when the conductor or leader indicates. For piano this usually means that the player should release all keys and pedals.

== Accidentals and key signatures ==
{{main|Accidental (music)|Key signature}}

=== Common accidentals ===
[[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] modify the pitch of the notes that follow them on the same staff position within a measure, unless cancelled by an additional accidental.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-flat.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Flat (music)|Flat]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by one [[semitone]].
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-sharp.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Sharp (music)|Sharp]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by one semitone.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-natural.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Natural sign|Natural]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Cancels a previous accidental, or modifies the pitch of a sharp or flat as defined by the prevailing key signature (such as F-sharp in the key of G major, for example).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-doubleflat.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Double flat]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by two chromatic semitones. Usually used when the note to modify is already flatted by the key signature.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-doublesharp.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Double sharp]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by two chromatic semitones. Usually used when the note to modify is already sharpened by the key signature.
|}

===Key signatures===
[[Key signature]]s define the prevailing [[Key (music)|key]] of the music that follows, thus avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]
|'''Flat key signature'''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|♭}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|♭}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are "flatted" (US) or "flattened" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|♭}} and E{{music|♭}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958.  I,24 "at least one note has to be sharpened or flattened"&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px]]
|'''Sharp key signature'''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Raises''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|♯}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.
|}

=== [[Quarter tone]]s ===
There is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for quarter tones involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:

{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]
|'''Demiflat'''&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]
|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]
|'''Demisharp'''&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]
|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.
|}

A symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.

In [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.

== Time signatures ==
{{main|Time signature}}
[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is "marked off" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]
|'''Specific time – simple time signatures'''&lt;br /&gt;The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as "three-four time" or "three-quarter time".
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]
|'''Specific time – compound time signatures'''&lt;br /&gt;The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as "Six-Eight Time".
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Common time]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented "imperfect" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''&lt;br /&gt;Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters "'''M.M.'''", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].
|}

== Note relationships ==
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical – that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.

Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.

A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tuplet]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Several notes sounded simultaneously ("solid" or "block"), or in succession ("broken"). Two-note chords are called '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]'''; three-note chords are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''&lt;br /&gt;A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a "broken chord".
|}

== Dynamics ==
{{main|Dynamics (music)}}
Dynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]
|'''Pianississimo'''&lt;ref name=ppp group=D&gt;Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra "iss" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo''). This is improper Italian and would translate literally to "softestest" in English, but acceptable as a musical term; such a dynamic can also be described as ''molto pianissimo'', ''piano pianissimo'' or ''molto fortissimo'' and ''forte fortissimo'' in somewhat more proper Italian.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely soft. Very infrequently does one see softer dynamics than this, which are specified with additional {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic pianissimo.svg|51px]]
|'''Pianissimo'''&lt;br /&gt;Very soft. Usually the softest indication in a piece of music, though softer dynamics are often specified with additional {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic piano.svg|29px]]
|'''Piano'''&lt;br /&gt;Soft; louder than ''pianissimo''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic mezzo piano.svg|50px]]
|'''Mezzo piano'''&lt;br /&gt;Moderately soft; louder than ''piano''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic mezzo forte.svg|50px]]
|'''Mezzo forte'''&lt;br /&gt;Moderately loud; softer than ''forte.'' If no dynamic appears, ''mezzo-forte'' is assumed to be the prevailing dynamic level.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic forte.svg|29px]]
|'''Forte'''&lt;br /&gt;Loud. Used as often as ''piano'' to indicate contrast.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic fortissimo.svg|46px]]
|'''Fortissimo'''&lt;br /&gt;Very loud. Usually the loudest indication in a piece, though louder dynamics are often specified with additional {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s (such as fortississimo – seen below).
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic fortississimo.svg|53px]]
|'''Fortississimo'''&lt;ref group=D name=ppp /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely loud. Very infrequently does one see louder dynamics than this, which are specified with additional {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music expression sforzando sfz.svg|42px]]
|'''Sforzando'''&lt;br /&gt;Literally "forced", denotes an abrupt, fierce accent on a single sound or chord. When written out in full, it applies to the sequence of sounds or chords under or over which it is placed.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-crescendo.svg|50px]]
|'''Crescendo'''&lt;br /&gt;A gradual increase in volume.&lt;br /&gt;Can be extended under many notes to indicate that the volume steadily increases during the passage.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|50px]]
|'''Diminuendo'''&lt;br /&gt;Also '''decrescendo'''&lt;br /&gt;A gradual decrease in volume. Can be extended in the same manner as crescendo.
|}
&lt;references group=D /&gt;
Other commonly used dynamics build upon these values. For example, "pianississimo" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) meaning so softly as to be almost inaudible, and fortississimo, ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) meaning extremely loud. In some European countries, use of the loudest dynamics has been strongly discouraged as endangering the hearing of the performers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html "No Fortissimo? Symphony Told to Keep It Down"] by [[Sarah Lyall]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (20 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A small {{serif|'''''s'''''}} in front of the dynamic notations means ''subito'', and means that the dynamic is to change to the new notation rapidly. Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).

{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]
|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (forte), then immediately softly (piano).
|}

Another value that rarely appears is ''[[Niente (musical dynamic)|niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means "nothing". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate "fade out to nothing".

== Articulation marks ==
[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staccato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking’s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''&lt;br /&gt;Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tenuto]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a slight dynamic emphasis or be combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Marcato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge). In organ notation, this means ''play a pedal note with the toe''. Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''&lt;br /&gt;A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires.
|}

== Ornaments ==
Ornaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a "shake". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill.  In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn.  In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.&lt;ref&gt;''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29&lt;/ref&gt;  In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a tremolo (q.v.).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-mordent.svg|100px]]
|'''Upper [[mordent]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly play the principal note, the next higher note (according to key signature) then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a "shake" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]
|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.
|}
{|
| style="width:20%;"|{{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}
|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''&lt;br /&gt;When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.
|}
{|
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged.  Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).

== Octave signs ==
{|
|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]
|style="padding-left:1em;"|'''Ottava'''&lt;br /&gt;The ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to ''play the passage one [[octave]] higher''.
An ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' or, as alternative in modern music, an ''8&lt;sup&gt;vb&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign (both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed ''below'' the staff meaning ''play the passage one octave lower''.&lt;ref&gt;George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company), p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Donato, ''Preparing Music Manuscript'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.), pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="padding-left:1em;"|'''Quindicesima'''&lt;br /&gt;The ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to mean ''play the passage two octaves higher''. A ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.
|}
''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.

|'''[[Tremolo]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as "as fast as possible", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.

In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussions and some untuned percussion instrument such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.

The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''&lt;br /&gt;Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]
|'''Simile marks'''&lt;br /&gt;Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]
|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')&lt;br /&gt;A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Da capo]]'''&lt;br /&gt; (lit. "From top") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. "to the end"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. "to the coda (sign)"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Dal segno]]'''&lt;br /&gt; (lit. "From the sign") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]
|'''Segno'''&lt;br /&gt;Mark used with ''dal segno''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign. Only used after playing through a ''D.S. al coda'' (Dal segno al coda) or ''D.C. al coda'' (Da capo al coda).

== Instrument-specific notation ==
=== Bowed string instruments ===
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Bartók pizzicato|Left-hand pizzicato]]''' or '''[[Stopped note]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A note on a stringed instrument where the string is plucked with the left hand (the hand that usually stops the strings) rather than bowed. On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a "stopped note" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn).  In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be "choked" (muted with the hand).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]
|'''Snap pizzicato'''&lt;br /&gt;On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it "snap" against the frame. Also known as a [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] pizzicato.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-harmonic.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|Natural harmonic]]''' or '''Open note'''&lt;br /&gt;On a stringed instrument, means to play a natural harmonic (also called '''flageolet'''). On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note "open" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]
|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''&lt;br /&gt;On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]
|'''Down bow''' or '''Giù arco'''&lt;br /&gt;Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.
|}

=== Guitar ===

The guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin. They are written above, below, or beside the note to which they are attached. 
They read as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol !! Spanish !! Latin !! English

| p || pulgar || pollex || thumb
|-
| i || índice || index || index
|-

==== Pedal marks ====
Pedal marks appear in music for instruments with [[sustain pedal]]s, such as the [[piano]], [[vibraphone]] and [[Tubular bell|chimes]].
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Pedal Mark 1.svg|50px]]
|'''Engage pedal'''&lt;br /&gt;Tells the player to put the [[sustaining pedal]] down.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-pedalup.svg|25px]]
|'''Release pedal'''&lt;br /&gt;Tells the player to let the sustain pedal up.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-pedal.svg|50px]]
|'''Variable pedal mark'''&lt;br /&gt;More accurately indicates the precise use of the sustain pedal. The extended lower line tells the player to keep the sustain pedal depressed for all notes below which it appears. The '''∧''' shape indicates the pedal is to be momentarily released, then depressed again.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"|[[Image:Mute on1.JPG|50px]]
|'''Con sordino''', '''Una corda'''&lt;br/&gt; Tells the player to put the [[soft pedal]] down or, in other instruments, apply the [[mute (music)|mute]].
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"|[[Image:Mute off1.JPG|50px]]
|'''Senza sordino''', '''Tre corde'''&lt;br/&gt; Tells the player to let the soft pedal up or, in other instruments, remove the mute.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:MIKE11.jpg|right|300px|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 13 July 2008}}|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 13 July 2008}}]] --&gt;
'''MIKE 11''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flow and water level, [[water quality]] and [[sediment transport]] in rivers, [[flood plain]]s, irrigation canals, reservoirs and other inland water bodies. MIKE 11 is a 1-dimensional river model. It was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]].

MIKE 11 has long been known as a software tool with advanced interface facilities. Since the beginning MIKE 11 was operated through an efficient interactive menu system with systematic layouts and sequencing of menus. It is within that framework where the latest ‘Classic’ version of MIKE 11 – version 3.20 was developed. 

The new generation of MIKE 11 combines the features and experiences from the MIKE 11 ‘Classic’ period, with the powerful Windows based user interface including graphical editing facilities and improved computational speed gained by the full utilization of 32-bit technology.

==Modules==
The computational core of MIKE 11 is a hydrodynamic simulation engine, and this is complemented by a wide range of additional modules and extensions covering almost all conceivable aspects of river modeling. 

'''HD module''': provides fully dynamic solution to the complete [[nonlinear]] [[1-D Saint Venant equation]]s, diffusive wave approximation and kinematic wave approximation, [[Muskingum method]] and [[Muskingum-Cunge method]] for simplified channel routing. It can automatically adapt to [[subcritical flow]] and [[supercritical flow]]. It has ability to simulate standard hydraulic structures such as [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[pump]]s, [[energy loss]] and [[sluice gate]]s. 

'''GIS Extension''': an extension of [[ArcMap]] from [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] providing features for catchment/river delineation, cross-section and [[Digital Elevation Model]](DEM) data, pollution load estimates, flood visualisation/animation as 2D maps and results presentation/analysis using [[Temporal Analyst]].

'''RR module''': a rainfall runoff module, including the unit hydrograph method (UHM), a lumped conceptual continuous hydrological model and a monthly [[soil moisture]] accounting model. It includes an auto-calibration tool to estimate model parameter based on statistic data of comparison of simulated water levels/discharges and observations.

'''SO module''': a structure operation module. It simulates operational structures such as [[sluice gate]]s, [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[pump]]s, [[bridge]]s with operating strategies.

'''DB module''': a dam break module. It provides complete facilities for definition of dam geometry, breach development in time and space as well as failure mode.

'''AUTOCAL module''': an automatic calibration tool. It allows automisation of the calibration process for a wide range of parameters, including rainfall runoff parameters, Manning's number, head loss coefficients, water quality parameters etc.

'''AD module''': an advection dispersion module. It simulates transport and spreading of conservative pollutants and constituents as well as heat with linear decay.

'''ST/GST module''': a noncohesive sediment module. It simulates transport, erosion and deposition of non-cohesive and graded noncohesive sediments, including simulations of river morphology.

'''ACS module''': a cohesive sediment module. It has 3-layer bed description, including quasi-2D erosion.

'''MIKE ECO Lab module''': provides ecological modeling. It can simulate [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]/[[Oxygen saturation|DO]], [[Ammonia]], [[Nitrate]], [[Eutrophication]], heavy metals and [[Wetland]]s. It includes standard templates that are well documented and have been used extensively in numerous applications worldwide. Based on predefined process templates, one can develop his/her own templates.

'''MIKE 11 Stratified module''': models vertical density differences such as salinity or temperature in two-layer or multi-layered stratified water bodies.

'''MIKE 11 Real Time module''': a simulation package and [[GIS]] front-end for setting up operational [[flood forecasting]] systems. It includes real-time updating and kalman filtering.

==Applications==
MIKE 11 has been used in hundreds of application around the world. Its main application areas are flood analysis and alleviation design, real-time flood forecasting, dam break analysis, optimisation of reservoir and canal gate/structure operations, ecological and water quality assessments in rivers and wetlands, sediment transport and river morphology studies, salinity intrusion in rivers and estuaries.

[[File:MZES Uni Mannheim A5.jpg|thumb|Main building of the MZES in the square A 5]]
The '''Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)''' is an interdisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Mannheim]], founded in 1989. It is located in the square A5 of the city of Mannheim nearby the [[Mannheim Palace]].

The institute devotes itself to research on societal and political developments in [[Europe]]. Research focus is located in comparative research on Europe and the investigation of the [[European integration]]. The MZES mainly carries out basic research, financed by external funds from the German national research foundation (''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft''), foundations promoting scientific research, and research funds from the [[European Union]]. Furthermore, the MZES, closely related to the ''School of Social Sciences'' of the University of Mannheim, gives training and support to young social scientists, when starting their scientific careers. At present, approximately 80 social scientists and 60 students are working at the MZES. Thus, the MZES is the largest institute of the University of Mannheim, and the largest research institute of a German university in the field of the social sciences.

From 1989–1998 the institute was composed of four work units:
* I Social structure and the Welfare State
* II Elections and Policy Research
* III Political and Social Integration
* IV German Democratic Republic / East Europe (1992 to 1998)

In 1999, these four work units were reduced to two research departments:
* Research Department A, ''The European Societies and their Integration'': since February 2017 directed by the sociologist ''Henning Hillmann''.
* Research Department B, ''The European Political Systems and their Integration '': since February 2017 directed by the political scientist ''Harald Schoen''.

The director and the heads of the research departments together form the executive board of the institute. The activity of the executive board and the institute is controlled by a supervisory board. The institute's research program is outlined for three years and evaluated by an international scientific advisory board. An ''annual report'' informs about the institute's activity.

== Directors ==
The director is elected by the supervisory board for a period of three years.
* [[Peter Flora]] 1989–1992 founding director, sociology
* Franz Urban Pappi 1993–1995, political science
* [[Peter Flora]] 1996–1998, sociology
* Jan W. van Deth 1999–2001, political science
* Walter Müller 2002–2004, sociology
* Wolfgang C. Müller 2005–2007, political science
* [[Bernhard Ebbinghaus]] 2008–2011, sociology
* Rüdiger Schmitt-Beck 2011-2014, political science
* Frank Kalter 2014-2017, sociology
* Marc Debus 2017-, political science

A managing director supports the director in his/her work. This position was held from 1989–1997 by Andreas Weber, and from 1998–2009 by Reinhart Schneider. Since 2010 Philipp Heldmann is managing director of the institute.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^4   \qquad\qquad      (0.43M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 2M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 1.4\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{3.5}   \qquad (2M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 20M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \approx 32000 \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}   \qquad \qquad (M &gt; 55M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;

For stars with masses less than 0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, [[convection]] is the sole energy transport process, so the relation changes significantly. For stars with masses ''M''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;55''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; the relationship flattens out and becomes ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; but in fact those stars don't last because they are unstable and quickly lose matter by intense solar winds. It can be shown this change is due to an increase in [[radiation pressure]] in massive stars.&lt;ref name="evolutionofstars"/&gt; These equations are determined empirically by determining the mass of stars in binary systems to which the distance is known via standard parallax measurements or other techniques. After enough stars are plotted, stars will form a line on a logarithmic plot and slope of the line gives the proper value of ''a''.

Another form, valid for K-type main-sequence stars, that avoids the discontinuity in the exponent has been given by Cuntz &amp; Wang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuntz|first=M.|author2=Wang, Zh. | date=2018|title=The Mass–Luminosity Relation for a Refined Set of Late-K/M Dwarfs|journal=Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society|volume=2 |issue=1|bibcode = 2018RNAAS...2a..19C|doi = 10.3847/2515-5172/aaaa67}}&lt;/ref&gt; it reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{L_{\odot}}  \approx \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{a(M)}   \qquad\qquad      (0.20M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 0.85M_{\odot})&lt;/math&gt;
with 
:&lt;math&gt;a(M) = -141.7 \cdot M^4 + 232.4 \cdot M^3 - 129.1 \cdot M^2 + 33.29 \cdot M + 0.215&lt;/math&gt;
(''M'' in ''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;).  This relation is based on data by Mann and collaborators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=A. W.| author2=Gaidos, E.|author3=Ansdell, M.|date=2013|title=Spectro-thermometry of M Dwarfs and Their Candidate Planets: Too Hot, Too Cool, or Just Right?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=779 |issue=2|id=188 (15 pages)|bibcode = 2013ApJ...779..188M|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/188|arxiv=1311.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used moderate-resolution spectra of nearby late-K and M dwarfs with known parallaxes and interferometrically determined radii to refine their effective temperatures and luminosities. Those stars have also been used as a calibration sample for [[Kepler mission|Kepler]] candidate objects. Besides avoiding the discontinuity in the exponent at ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.43''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, the relation also recovers ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.0 for ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8771;&amp;nbsp;0.85''M''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.

The mass/luminosity relation is important because it can be used to find the distance to [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]]s which are too far for normal [[parallax]] measurements, using a technique called "[[dynamical parallax]]".&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullaney|first=James|title=Double and multiple stars and how to observe them|publisher=Springer|date=2005|isbn=1-85233-751-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OM3hozlKt9AC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=da06NVpIY_&amp;dq=Mass-Luminosity%20relation%20distance%20binary&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, the masses of the two stars in a binary system are estimated, usually as being the mass of the Sun. Then, using [[Kepler's laws]] of [[celestial mechanics]], the distance between the stars is calculated. Once this distance is found, the distance away can be found via the arc subtended in the sky, giving a preliminary distance measurement. From this measurement and the [[apparent magnitude]]s of both stars, the luminosities can be found, and by using the mass–luminosity relationship, the masses of each star. These masses are used to re-calculate the separation distance, and the process is repeated. The process is iterated many times, and accuracies as high as 5% can be achieved.&lt;ref name="double"/&gt; The mass/luminosity relationship can also be used to determine the lifetime of stars by noting that lifetime is approximately proportional to M/L although one finds that more massive stars have shorter lifetimes than what the M/L relationship predicts. A more sophisticated calculation factors in a star's loss of mass over time.

==Derivation==
Deriving a theoretically exact mass/luminosity relation requires finding the energy generation equation and building a thermodynamic model of the inside of a star. However, the basic relation ''L''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be derived using some basic physics and simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name="physicsofstars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=A.C.|title=The Physics of Stars|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=1999|isbn=978-0-471-98798-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such derivation was performed by astrophysicist [[Arthur Eddington]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lecchini|first=Stefano|title=How Dwarfs Became Giants. The Discovery of the Mass-Luminosity Relation|isbn=978-3-9522882-6-9|publisher=Bern Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science|url=http://philoscience.unibe.ch/bern-studies/how-dwarfs-became-giants-the-discovery-of-the-mass-luminosity-relation}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivation showed that stars can be approximately modelled as ideal gases, which was a new, somewhat radical idea at the time. What follows is a somewhat more modern approach based on the same principles.

An important factor controlling the luminosity of a star (energy emitted per unit time) is the rate of energy dissipation through its bulk. Where there is no [[heat convection]], this dissipation happens mainly by photons diffusing. By integrating [[Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion#Fick's_first_law|Fick's first law]] over the surface of some radius ''r'' in the [[radiation zone]] (where there is neglible convection), we get the total outgoing energy flux which is equal to the luminosity by [[conservation of energy]]:
::&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''D'' is the photons [[diffusion coefficient]], and ''u'' is the energy density.

Note that this assumes that the star is not fully convective, and that all heat creating processes ([[nucleosynthesis]]) happen in the core, below the radiation zone. These two assumptions are not correct in [[red giant]]s, which do not obey the usual mass-luminosity relation. Stars of low mass are also fully convective, hence do not obey the law.

Approximating the star by a [[black body]], the energy density is related to the temperature by [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] by:
::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{4}{c} \, \sigma_B \, T^4 &lt;/math&gt;
where
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_B = \frac{2 \pi^5 k_B^4 }{15 c^2 h^3} = \frac{\pi^2 k_B^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

As in the [[Diffusion#Elementary_theory_of_diffusion_coefficient_in_gases|elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases]], the diffusion coefficient ''D'' approximately satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{1}{3}c\,\lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;lambda; is the photon [[mean free path]].

Since matter is fully ionized in the star core (as well as where the temperature is of the same order of magnitude as inside the core), photons collide mainly with electrons, and so &amp;lambda; [[Mean_free_path#Derivation|satisfies]] 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{1}{n_e\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density and:
::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma} = \frac{8\pi}{3}\left(\frac{\alpha\hbar c}{m_ec^2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
is the cross section for electron-photon scattering, equal to [[Thomson scattering|Thomson cross-section]]. &amp;alpha; is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; the electron mass.

The average stellar electron density is related to the star mass ''M'' and radius ''R''
::&lt;math&gt;\langle n_e \rangle = \frac{M}{m_e 4\pi R^3/3}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, by the [[virial theorem]], the total kinetic energy is equal to half the gravitational potential energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, so if the average nuclei mass is ''m''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, then the average kinetic energy per nucleus satisfies:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}k_B T = \frac{1}{2}E_G\frac{m_n}{M} = C\frac{3}{10}\frac{G M m_n}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where the temperature ''T'' is averaged over the star and ''C'' is a factor of order one related to the stellar structure and can be estimated from the star approximate [[polytrope|polytropic index]].
Note that this does not hold for large enough stars, where the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone, hence the relation between temperature, mass and raidus is different, as elaborated below.

Wrapping up everything, we also take ''r'' to be equal to ''R'' up tp a factor, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; at ''r'' is replaced by its stellar average up to a facotr. The combined factor is approximately 1/15 for the sun, and we get:
:&lt;math&gt;L = -4\pi\,r^2 D\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \approx 4\pi\,R^2 D\frac{u}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;L \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{64\pi^2}{9}\frac {\sigma_B}{\sigma_{e\cdot\gamma}}\frac{R^4 T^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \approx  \frac{1}{15}\frac{2\pi^3}{9\cdot5^5}\frac {G^4\,m_e^2\,m_n^5}{\alpha^2\hbar^5}\,M^3 = 4\cdot {10^{26}}_W \,\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;

The added factor is actually dependent on ''M'', therefore the law has an approximate &lt;math&gt;M^{3.5}&lt;/math&gt; dependence.

==Distinguishing between small and large stellar masses==
{{Main|Eddington luminosity}}
One may distinguish between the cases of small and large stellar masses by deriving the above results using radiation pressure. In this case, it is easier to use the optical opacity &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and to consider the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; directly; more precisely, one can consider the average temperature in the [[radiation zone]].

The consideration begins by noting the relation between the [[radiation pressure]] P&lt;sub&gt;rad&lt;/sub&gt; and luminosity. The gradient of radiation pressure is equal to the momentum transfer absorbed from the radiation, giving:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP_{rad}}{dr} = -\frac {\kappa\rho}{c}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the velocity of light. Here, &lt;math&gt;1/\kappa\rho = l&lt;/math&gt;; the photon mean free path.

The radiation pressure is related to the temperature by &lt;math&gt;P_{rad} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c}{T_I}^4&lt;/math&gt;, therefore

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^3\frac{dT_I}{dr} = -\frac {3\kappa\rho}{16\sigma}\frac{L}{4\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto {T_I}^4 \frac {R}{\rho}  \varpropto {T_I}^4  \frac {R^4}{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the radiation zone gravity is balanced by the pressure on the gas coming from both itself (approximated by ideal gas pressure) and from the radiation. For a small enough stellar mass the latter is negligible and one arrives at

&lt;math&gt;T_I \varpropto \frac {M}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

as before. More precisely, since integration was done from 0 to R so &lt;math&gt;T_I-T_E&lt;/math&gt; on the left side, but the surface temperature T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; can be neglected with respect to the internal temperature T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;.

From this it follows directly that

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M^3.&lt;/math&gt;

For a large enough stellar mass, the radiation pressure is larger than the gas pressure in the radiation zone. Plugging in the radiation pressure, instead of the ideal gas pressure used above, yields

&lt;math&gt;{T_I}^4\varpropto \frac{M^2}{R^4},&lt;/math&gt;

hence

&lt;math&gt;L \varpropto M.&lt;/math&gt;

==Core and surface temperatures==

To the first approximation, stars are [[black body]] radiators with a surface area of 4''πR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, from the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], the luminosity is related to the surface temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, and thrught it to the [[Color temperature|color]] of the star, by
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma_B T_S^4&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], 5.67&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt;W m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

The luminosity is equal to the total energy produced by the star per unit time. Since this energy is produced by nucleosynthesis, usually in the star core (this is not true for [[red giant]]s), the core temperature is related to the luminosity by the [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Reaction rate|nucleosynthesis rate]] per unit volume:
::&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{dE}{dt} \approx  \epsilon \, \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 \, n_A \, n_B  \, \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3 m_R}}\, \sqrt{E_0(T)} \frac{S(E_0(T))}{kT} e^{-\frac{3E_0(T)}{kT}}  &lt;/math&gt;
Here, &amp;epsilon; is the total energy emitted in the [[proton-proton chain reaction|chain reaction]] or [[CNO cycle|reaction cycle]]. &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \left(\sqrt{E_G}\,kT/2\right)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow peak]] energy, dependent on ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Gamow factor]]. Additionally, ''S''(''E'')/E is the reaction cross section, ''n'' is number density, &lt;math&gt;m_R = m_A\cdot m_B/(m_A+m_B)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced mass]] for the particle collision, and ''A'',''B'' are the two species participating in the limiting reaction (e.g. both stand for a proton in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]], or ''A'' a proton and ''B'' an {{nuclide|nitrogen|14|link=yes}} nucleus for the [[CNO cycle]]).

Since the radius ''R'' is itself a function of the temperature and the mass, one may solve this equation to get the core temperature.

'''The Media Practice Model''' is a media effects model used within the area of [[mass communication]].  This model was developed by '''Jeanne R. Steele''' and '''Jane D. Brown''' in 1995, and it takes a practice perspective which means that it focuses on everyday activities and routines of [[media consumption]]. This [[theoretical]] framework was developed to better understand what drives [[teenagers]] to pick one media source over another, and what factors play a role in this decision. The Media Practice Model emphasizes the constant interaction between consumers and the media, and focuses on the [[dialectical]] aspect of this interaction, suggesting that it is the adolescents’ individual characteristics, environment and daily practices that allow the media to have stronger or weaker effects on them (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J.R., &amp; Brown, J.D. (1995). Adolescent room culture: Studying media in the context of everyday life. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 24(5), 551.  Retrieved November 30, 2010, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 12036417)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The model was developed based on a study that progressed from 1987 through 1993, and used a variety of methods such as daily [[newspaper|journals]], in-depth [[interviews]], self-administered [[questionnaires]] and “room touring” to understand, as the Steele and Brown call it, the adolescents’ “room [[culture]].” This environment was chosen based on the facts that adolescents’ bedrooms are usually cluttered with different media materials and sources, as well as the fact that this is a place where adolescents spend a good part of their day. This is also a place that provides an intimate environment where adolescents can experiment with possible selves (Markus &amp; Nurius, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Nurius, P. (1986). Possible selves. Am. Psychol. 41: 954-969&lt;/ref&gt; The Media Practice Model was based on the findings of this first study, and the incorporation of other media effects theories such as [[Selective Exposure Theory]], [[Uses and Gratifications]], [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]], [[Cultivation theory]], and Emotional Conditioning.

== Components ==

The Media Practice Model proposed by Steele and Brown has the concepts of selection, [[interaction]] and application as the three main components, but also takes into account one’s [[Identity formation|identity]] and lived experience. [[Identity formation]] is the key component of this model and it represents the main task of adolescent formation (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). It is believed that adolescents’ sense of who they are influences their interactions with the media, and those interactions in turn influence their sense of who they are, in what Steele and Brown call an ongoing process of [[cultural]] production and reproduction. The [[theoretical]] perspective of “'''lived through experience'''” ([[Vygotsky]], 1978),&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1978). Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes. In M. Cole, V. John-Steiner, S. Scribner, and E. Souberman (Eds.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the [[Developmental stage theories|developmental stage]], the [[sociocultural]] differences based on gender, class, and race, as well as other factors such as [[religious beliefs]], interactions within one’s neighborhood, school, family, friends circle, and so on. This concept of “lived experience” emphasizes the idea that adolescents’ interaction with the media does not happen in a vacuum. It is argued that the continuous dialectal relationship between the other four components of the Media Practice Model, selection, interaction, application, and identity, all occur within the context of “lived experience (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).” 
	

'''Selection''', within the Media Practice Model, is simply defined as the act of choosing among media related alternatives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). Selection is influenced by [[motivation]]s, which in turn affects [[attention]] to the media selected. In this context, the concept of motivation is defined based on previous theories such as [[Selective exposure theory|selective exposure]] and [[uses and gratifications theory]]. This means that a teenager’s motivation to attend to certain media might be based on [[affective]], [[behavioral]], [[cognitive]] and [[Instrumental value|instrumental]] needs, or it could also simply be a result of [[habituation]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As far as factoring in “lived experience”, in their initial study Steele and Brown found that selection is also influenced by gender and race. Thus, boys were more likely to be more interested in media that dealt with sports, and this was also reflected in how their rooms were decorated. Also, an African-American girl was more interested in magazines and certain types of music that reflected her [[ethnic heritage]]. 
	

'''Interaction''' is defined as the [[cognitive]], [[affective]], and [[behavioral]] engagement with the media that produces [[cultural]] meanings, which are affected by adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of the media content. In terms of practice, interaction was conceptually defined as what is actually happening at the moment adolescent use the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). As noted in the definition, adolescents can interact with the media on different levels such as cognitive (processing information), affective (arousal), or behavioral (dancing, channel surfing, etc.). However, researchers in communication have been more concerned with the cognitive and affective interactions, and adolescents’ evaluation and interpretation of media content are clearly more closely related to those two types of interactions.

:''Evaluation'' and ''interpretation'' of media content are also believed to play an important role in the process of [[identity formation]]. Thus, adolescents are more likely to prefer characters that they can relate to, that match with who they are or would like to become (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In their study, Steele and Brown (1995) came across different interpretation and evaluation of the media, as teenagers were trying to make sense of the messages the media were conveying. This process of sense making is sometimes very complex, as teenagers are trying to understand themselves and the world around them by trying to balance their already formed beliefs and worldviews, with the sometimes contradictory messages of the media (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995).

The concept of “lived experience” was shown to have a role in the interaction component of the model as well. As found by Steele and Brown, [[racial]] understanding, class and gender also affected how teenagers interpreted and evaluated the messages conveyed by the media.

'''Application''' is defined as the [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] ways in which adolescents use media in their everyday lives (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). The Media Practice Model looks at two different types of application: appropriation and incorporation.

:''Appropriation'' is an active, [[intentional]], easily visible and goal oriented use of the media by adolescents. Steele and Brown (1995) found some typical examples of media appropriation when it comes to teenagers: enhance a mood or cope with feelings; sort through cultural values and norms; make a statement about identity; imitate admired behavior; fantasize about possible selves or situations. ''Incorporation'', on the other hand, is harder to recognize because it is more internal, it is less visible, and most of the times happens [[unconsciously]]. Incorporation refers to taking the messages and beliefs conveyed by the media and making them a part of the [[self]], building on already existing [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[feeling]]s and [[knowledge]] (Steele &amp; Brown, 1995). In trying to better explain the concept of incorporation, Steele and Brown (1995) build upon other media effects theories such as framing, cultivation, and emotional conditioning.

== Development ==
	
Based on reviewers’ critiques that the concepts of incorporation and appropriation are one and the same thing, and also based on a new study performed in 1999, Steele slightly revised this component of the Media Practice Model. Based on the study, Steele noticed that within the application component of the model, a new factor stood out: resistance. Resistance was defined as “teens’ practice of using media to open up a space for combating the status quo (Steele, 1999).” This suggests that when adolescents feel marginalized they engage with media that go against the dominant culture. This way they become fans of movies that depict drug usage, are graphically violent or show sexually explicit material, or start listening to less culturally popular genres of music such as [[hard rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (Steele, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Steele, J. (1999). Teenage Sexuality and Media Practice: Factoring in the Influences of Family, Friends, and School (Book). Journal of Sex Research, 36(4), 331-341. Retrieved from Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete database&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Besides contributing to the Media Practice Model through the discussed revision to the application component, Steele’s (1999) study also provided more depth to the “lived experience” component. It demonstrated more explicitly how one’s race, gender, and developmental stage plays an important role in their media practices and choices. Also, while acknowledging the importance of media content, this study puts more emphasis on media practice rather than on [[Content (media)|media content]] or [[media effects]].

Since it was first introduced by Steele and Brown in 1995, and then revised in 1999 by Steele, the Media Practice Model has been used by other researchers in different contexts; however, this model has experienced modest popularity. One of the main drawbacks of this model is its general scope and simplified description of media use. Even so, this model allows for the integration of a whole multitude of variables within its main components, and offers scholars the possibility to use it for more in-depth investigative purposes if desired.

'''Millsaps College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the state capital. Founded in 1890 and affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], Millsaps is home to 985 students. One of 40 colleges featured in Loren Pope's ''Colleges That Change Lives,'' it is one of only 21 private colleges nationwide named a ''Best Buy'' in the 2013 ''Fiske Guide to Colleges''.

==History==
The college was founded in 1889–90 by a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran, Major [[Reuben Webster Millsaps]], who donated the land for the college and $50,000. Dr. [[William Belton Murrah]] was the college's first president, and Bishop [[Charles Betts Galloway]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] organized the college's early fund-raising efforts. Both men were honored with halls named in their honor. Major Millsaps and his wife are interred in a tomb near the center of campus. The current United Methodist Church continues to have affiliations with the college.

==Academics==
Despite its religious affiliation, the curriculum is secular.  The writing-intensive core curriculum requires each student to compile an acceptable portfolio of written work before completion of the sophomore year.  Candidates for an undergraduate degree must also pass oral and written [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exams]] in their major field of study.  These exams last up to three hours, and may cover any required or elective course offered by the major department.  Unacceptable performance on comprehensive exams will prevent a candidate from receiving a degree, even if all course work has been completed.  "Comps" are usually associated with graduate degree requirements, so their inclusion at the undergraduate level is a source of pride (and possibly pressure) for Millsaps students. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Millsaps offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration|B.B.A.]], [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] and [[Master of Accountancy|MAcc]] degrees and corresponding programs.

The current undergraduate population is 910 students on a 103 [[acre]] (417,000 m²) campus near downtown [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The student to faculty ratio is 1:9 with an average class size around 15 students. Millsaps offers 32 majors and 41 minors, including the option of a self-designed major, along with a multitude of study abroad and internship opportunities. Millsaps employs 97 full-time faculty members. Of those, 94 percent of tenure-track faculty hold a Ph.D. or the terminal degree in their field. The professors on the [[tenure]] track have the highest degree in their field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}   The college offers research partnerships for undergraduate students, and a variety of study abroad programs.  Millsaps reports that 57% of their student body comes from outside Mississippi; a large portion of out-of-state students are from neighboring [[Louisiana]]. Millsaps is home to 910 undergraduate, 75 graduate students from 26 states and territories plus 23 countries. The college also offers a [[Continuing Education]] program and the Community Enrichment Series for adults in the Jackson area.

==Campus==
[[File:Millsaps College.jpg|thumb|left|Millsaps College campus.]]
The Millsaps campus is close to downtown Jackson. It is bordered by Woodrow Wilson Avenue to the north, North State Street to the east, West Street to the west, and Marshall Street to the south.

The center of campus is dominated by "The Bowl," where many events occur, including Homecoming activities, concerts, the Multicultural Festival, and Commencement.  Adjacent to the Bowl is the Campbell College Center, renovated in 2000, which contains the campus bookstore, post office, cafeteria, and Student Life offices.  This central section of campus also holds the Gertrude C. Ford Academic Complex, Olin Science Hall, Sullivan-Harrell Hall, and the Millsaps-Wilson Library.

The north part of campus includes the Hall Activities Center (commonly called "the HAC"), the sports fields, and the freshman dormitories. On the far northwestern corner is James Observatory, the oldest building on campus. Operational since 1901, the observatory underwent major renovations in 1980. It is open for celestial gazing.

Upperclassmen dormitories are located on the south side of campus, with Fraternity Row and the Christian Center. Originally constructed as a memorial to students and graduates who died in service during World War II, the Christian Center houses an auditorium and the departments of Performing Arts, History and Religious Studies.

Between the Christian Center and Murrah Hall, which houses the Else School of Management, is the tomb of Major Millsaps and the "M" Bench, erected by the classes of 1926, 1927, and 1928. The Nicholson Garden was added to improve the aesthetics of this area.

==Rankings and distinctions==
Millsaps was ranked 90 out of 251 national liberal arts colleges in the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] of America's Best Colleges Issue; top ranked liberal arts college in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama; also, named to the list of "High School Counselors' Picks" for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/millsaps-college-2414 |title=Millsaps College &amp;#124; Best College &amp;#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps College professors are ranked among the best in the nation, according to The [[Princeton Review]]'s The Best 377 Colleges - 2013 Edition. The Millsaps faculty won praise in The Princeton Review's special Top 20 category:  Professors Get High Marks, where Millsaps was ranked twelfth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx |title=College Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Review]] also named the Else School of Management at Millsaps College one of the Best Business Schools in the Southeast in the 2011 edition of its book, ''The Best 300 Business Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/business-school-rankings.aspx |title=Business School Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is one of 40 schools in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcl.org/ |title=Colleges That Change Lives &amp;#124; Changing Lives. One Student at a Time |publisher=Ctcl.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is among 21 private universities and colleges nationwide named a "best buy" in the ''[[Fiske Guide to Colleges]] 2013''. Millsaps is the only institution in Mississippi to earn the "best buy" honor from the annual guide. The guide names Millsaps as "the strongest liberal arts college in the deep, Deep South and by far the most progressive" and notes that what differentiates the school is "its focus on scholarly inquiry, spiritual growth, and community service, along with its Heritage Program, an interdisciplinary approach to world culture."

Millsaps leads the list of 13 [[United Methodist]]–related colleges named among the top 100 liberal arts colleges by the 2012 [[Washington Monthly]] College Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |title=Liberal Arts College Rankings 2012 |publisher=Washington Monthly |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115154936/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{main|Millsaps Majors}}

The school's sports teams [[List of U.S. college team nicknames|are known as]] the Majors, and their colors are purple and white. They participate in the [[NCAA Division III]] and the [[Southern Athletic Association]].

Men's sports include: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team. Women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance team, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team.

The Majors had a fierce football and basketball rivalry with [[Mississippi College]] in nearby [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] through the 1950s before competition was suspended after an infamous student brawl at a basketball game.  Campus legend says the brawl was sparked by the alleged theft of the body of Millsaps founder Major Millsaps by Mississippi College students.  The rivalry was considered by many as the best in Mississippi, featuring a prank by Mississippi College students who painted "TO HELL WITH MILSAPS" (sic) on the Millsaps Observatory.  The football rivalry resumed in 2000 as the "Backyard Brawl", with games at [[Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium]].  The rivalry took a one-year hiatus in 2005 but resumed in 2006.

Millsaps was the summer training camp home for the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[New Orleans Saints]] in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Millsaps was also home to the famous game-ending play in the [[2007 Trinity vs. Millsaps football game]], in which [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] executed 15 laterals on the way to a touchdown, defeating Millsaps by a score of 28-24.  The play later won the Pontiac Game-Changing Performance of the Year award, which had never before been bestowed upon a play outside of the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA#Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]].

In 2008, Millsaps quarterback [[Juan Joseph]] was awarded the [[Conerly Trophy]], which goes to the best football player in the state of [[Mississippi]].

==Greek organizations==
The school is home to five different [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]: [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[Kappa Sigma]]; as well as five [[fraternities and sororities|sororities]]: [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].

==Navy V-12 program==
Nearly 53 years after founding the college, Millsaps was chosen as one of 131 sites for the training of [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marine]] officers in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].

In April 1943, 380 students arrived for the Navy V-12 program. It offered [[engineering]], pre-[[Medicine|medical]] and pre-[[Dentistry|dental]]. Thereafter Millsaps began accepting students year-round for the program. A total of 873 officer candidates went through Millsaps between 1943 and 1945.

Traces of the Navy V-12 unit appear in the ''Bobashela'' (school [[yearbook]]) in 1944. That year, the ''Bobashela'' staff decided to dedicate the yearbook to the unit and Dr. Sanders, one of the unit's advisers. One section memorialized students who had been killed in action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' (generically, '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] (''[[charter]]'') establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].  The concept developed in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Traditionally the granting of a charter gave a settlement and its inhabitants the right to [[town privileges]] under the [[Feudalism|feudal system]].  Townspeople who lived in chartered towns were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], as opposed to [[serfs]] who lived in villages.  Towns were often "[[Free imperial city|free]]", in the sense that they were directly protected by the king or emperor, and were not part of a feudal [[Fiefdom|fief]].

Today the process for granting is determined by the type of government of the state in question.  In monarchies, charters are still often a [[royal charter]] given by [[the Crown]] or the state authorities acting on behalf of the Crown.  In federations, the granting of charters may be within the jurisdiction of the lower level of government such as  [[province]].

==Canada==
{{main article|Local government in Canada}}
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

==Philippines==
{{main article|Cities of the Philippines}}
Since the beginning of American colonial rule, Philippines cities were formally established through laws enacted by the various national legislatures in the country. The [[Philippine Commission]] gave the city of Manila its charter in 1901, while the city of Baguio was established by the [[Philippine Assembly]] which was composed by elected members instead of appointed ones. During the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth era]], the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] established an additional ten cities. Since achieving independence from the United States in 1946 the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] has established 124 more cities (as of September 2007), the majority of which required the holding of a [[plebiscite]] within the proposed city's jurisdiction to ratify the city's charter.

== Sweden ==
In [[Sweden]] until 1951, cities were established by [[royal charter]]; see [[City status in Sweden]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], towns and cities are established by [[royal charter]]; see [[city status in the United Kingdom]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], such [[charter]]s are established either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general [[municipal corporation]] [[law]], usually after the proposed charter has passed a [[referendum]] vote of the affected population.

A municipal charter is the basic document that defines the organization, powers, functions and essential procedures of the city government. The charter is, therefore, the most important legal document of any city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-structures/municipal-charters|title=Municipal Charters|website=www.nlc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities without charters, in states where such exist, are known as [[general-law municipality|general-law municipalities or cities]].

[[File:Statue of Sekhemka.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sekhemka]]
The '''Northampton Sekhemka statue''' is an [[Ancient Egyptian]] artefact, given by the [[Marquess of Northampton]] to [[Northampton Museum]], in or about 1870. The statue dates from the [[5th dynasty]] (c. 2494–2345 BC, making it slightly older than [[Stonehenge]]) and depicts Sekhemka the scribe with his wife, Sitmerit. It was the subject of a controversial sale in July 2014, that raised questions of the museum's ownership and the [[Deaccessioning (museum)|ethics of selling artefacts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/11072014-ma-condemns-sale-sekhemka#.U8U4TPnIbck | title=MA Condemns Sale of Sekhemka Statue | publisher=11 July 2014 | date=11 July 2014 |author=Heal, Sharon | accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was sold to an unidentified buyer for £15.76m, which broke the world record for Ancient Egyptian art at auction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Museum faces outcry over sale of ancient Egyptian statue", ''Financial Times'' (London), 11 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by [[Arts Council England]], which ruled that the sale did not meet the accredited standards for museums in managing their collections.&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-28602849 | title=Sekhemka statue: Northampton Museum loses Art Council accreditation | publisher=BBC News | date=1 August 2014 | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The statue depicts Sekhemka sitting in a traditional scribal pose and holding on his knees a partly unrolled papyrus which lists various offerings. He is named in an inscription on the plinth of his statue as "Inspector of Scribes in the House of Largesse, one revered before the Great God". His wife Sit-Merit is shown sitting at his feet. The limestone statue is {{conv|75|cm|in}} tall with the base from front to rear being {{conv|43|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205, T. G. H. James, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]], editor of ''British Archaeology'', took many detailed colour photographs of the statue whilst it was on display in [[Christie's]] prior to auction and has published them on his own blog.&lt;ref name="archaeologyuk.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Things About Sekhemka|author= Mike Pitts|url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/cba/staff/mikepitts|accessdate=1 December 2015}}{{cite web|url=http://mikepitts.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/six-things-about-sekhemka/|title=DIGGING DEEPER|date= 13 July 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
[[File:A Victorian Journey.jpg|thumb|Display case from "Ancient Egypt: The Northampton Collection" 1987]]
The statue's provenance is unclear. ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' reports that one account describes the statue as being acquired by Northampton Museum in 1849 from the Ottoman sultan, while another version holds that it was acquired by the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton|2nd Marquess of Northampton]] during a trip to Egypt, after which his son offered it to Northampton Museum in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"&gt;Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. G. H. James]] noted in 1961 that Northampton Museum held no precise information regarding the acquisition of the statue, but that it was presented to the museum around 1870 by the [[Charles Compton, 3rd Marquess of Northampton|3rd Marquess of Northampton]] and, based on a record from 1899, it is likely to have been acquired by the 2nd Marquess during a trip to Egypt in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;The Northampton Statue of Sekhemka, T. G. H. James, ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', Vol. 49, (Dec. 1963), pp. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial sale==
Northampton Borough Council claimed that they learned the full value of the Sekhemka statue in 2012 during an insurance assessment, and according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' it "immediately began making plans to cash it in and use the money for other heritage projects in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cross |first1=Charlotte |title=Lord Northampton fights council over £2m Egyptian statue |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10077157/Lord-Northampton-fights-council-over-2m-Egyptian-statue.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then leader of Northampton Borough Council, [[David Mackintosh (politician)|David Mackintosh]], told the BBC that the statue had "been in our ownership for over 100 years and it's never really been the centrepiece of our collection", and that "We want to expand our museum and to do that we need to raise the money".&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Northampton borough council sells Egyptian statue for almost £16m |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/10/northampton-borough-council-sells-egyptian-statue-sekhemka |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council proposed to use the amount realized through a sale for funding “the restoration of [[Delapre Abbey]], improvements to the museum service and/or other cultural or heritage projects” but the Museum Association asked that proposed sale be halted pending consultation which "was needed to establish the financially motivated disposal was 'last resort'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/25092012-museums-association-ethics-committee-advises-northampton-borough-council-hold-off-sale-2-million-pound-monument#.U8UuXfnIbcl|title=Ethics Committee advises Northampton to hold off sale of £2m monument - Museums Association|work=museumsassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security concerns ===
The council stated that when the statue was valued in 2010 it was taken off display because of security concerns, and that it would have required 24-hour guarding.&lt;ref&gt;''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'', 18 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, Axa Art Insurance Ltd subsequently reported that the cabinet display previously used in Northampton Museum was "adequate".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;,{{cite news |title=SPECIAL REPORT: Should Northampton’s Sekhemka statue be sold off? |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/special-report-should-northampton-s-sekhemka-statue-be-sold-off-1-6128571 |work=Northampton Chronicle and Echo |date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council were also asked "why, when the Friends of Northampton Museum and Art Gallery offered £8,000 to buy a new cabinet, was the offer not taken up?" but did not reply to this specific question.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Public consultation===
In October 2012, the council published the results of a petition that was signed by 199 (average of all petitions 193 as of July 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonboroughcouncil.com/councillors/mgEPetitionListDisplay.aspx?XXR=0&amp;VM=2&amp;DR=19/06/2001%20-%2017/07/2014&amp;ACT=Go|title=Northampton Borough Council - Active and Completed ePetitions|work=northamptonboroughcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
:We the undersigned petition the council to Reconsider the proposed sale of Sekhemka in view of the comments below it is believed that the proposed sale will have a profound detrimental effect on Northampton Museums, is against the intentions of the original Donors, will possibly cause the Museums to lose both Accredited and Designated Status and this lose access to significant public funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonboroughcouncil.com/councillors/mgEPetitionDisplay.aspx?ID=27&amp;RPID=11994184&amp;HPID=11994184|title=Northampton Borough Council - ePetition - Proposed sale of Sekhemka|work=northamptonboroughcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northampton Borough Council claimed in January 2013 to have sought the views of the public regarding the proposed sale of the statue, but the form this took was criticised by the Museum Associations ethics committee:&lt;ref&gt;"Consultation into Sale of Statue Provokes Criticism", Patrick Steel, Issue 112/12, P. 7, 1 December 2012 [http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/01122012-consultation-into-sale-provokes-criticism#.U8PcnPnIbck]&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In particular, the questionnaire just asks respondents to tick which area of investment the sale proceeds should go to. It does not ask people whether the sale should go ahead, and does not "acknowledge the historical importance of the object to the museum".

Nevertheless, the BBC repeated the council's claim that the consultation indicated that of the 173 replies 51% were in favour and 49% were against the sale.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Northampton to get £6m from Egyptian Sekhemka sale|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-28260067|work=BBC News|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No question in the consultation document asked whether the statue should be sold or not; however, those who participated in the consultation could leave optional narrative comments, and the council used these to claim a small majority in favour of selling the statue.&lt;ref&gt;"Results of Consultation on the proposed sale of an Egyptian funerary monument of Sekhemka", Northampton Burgh Council, 17 January 2013 [http://www.northampton.gov.uk/downloads/file/5615/results_of_consultation_on_the_proposed_sale_of_an_egyptian_funerary_monument_of_sekhemka]&lt;/ref&gt; The Save Sekhemka Action Group objected to the methods used in the consultation document:
:In order to get a better picture of the public’s opinion the Action Group hereby launches its OWN survey; it does take NBC’s views into account but also offers an opportunity for sensible and detailed answers.&lt;ref&gt;"Action Group Launches Own Survey on Proposed Sale of Sekhemka", The Save Sekhemka Action Group, 14 November 2012 [http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/action-group-launches-own-survey-on.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save Sekhemka Action Group reported that their own survey showed "overwhelming support for protecting the museum's accredited status and keeping the statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2012_12_01_archive.html|title=Save Sekhemka Action Group|author=Phil Cotter|work=sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'' carried out a Facebook poll in June 2014, and found that the majority wanted to keep the statue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Northampton Chronicle and Echo'', 19 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private deal between Council and Lord Northampton===
The present [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton|Lord Northampton]] originally protested at the decision of Northampton Borough Council to sell the statue. However, the BBC reported that, following negotiations lasting a year, he struck a private deal with the council which resulted in him receiving £6 million from the sale. Northampton Borough Council has refused to release details of the legal arrangement.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The Marquess had previously been involved with the controversial attempted sale of the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name="archaeologyuk.org"/&gt;

In June 2014, the council was asked by a local newspaper: "Are you prepared to show the documents and agreements made with the Marquess of Northampton to any member of the public who asks to see them? If not, why not?" and replied "The details of the agreement are confidential between Lord Northampton and the borough council, but we can confirm that 55% of the sale will go to the council and 45% will go to Lord Northampton."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The council also stated "The council’s ownership of Sekhemka has been confirmed following advice from lawyers, who are satisfied we have legal right to proceed with the sale. We do not have any deed specifically relating to Sekhemka."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After the sale of the statue The Save Sekhemka Action Group questioned why the Marquess of Northampton would be receiving over £5 million from the proceeds since, according to Northampton Borough Council, the council owned the statue.&lt;ref name="sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/Statement.html|title=Save Sekhemka Action Group|work=sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protests===
The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities|Ministry of Antiquities]] asked the Egyptian Embassy in London to take all legal procedures to stop the sale of the statue. Minister Mamdouh Al-Damati condemned the sale as being incompatible with the values and role of museums worldwide which should spread culture rather than seeking to earn money.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; He also called on the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) to stop the sale on ethical grounds. The Museum Association for the United Kingdom warned the council that it would review Northampton’s membership if it went ahead with the sale.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; The [[Arts Council of England]] said the sale could jeopardise the accreditation status of Northampton Museums and that could in future limit the museum's ability to obtain grant funding.&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram Weekly Issue 1205"/&gt; Archaeologist Andy Brockman, who took part in the Save Sekhemka campaign said the sale would "bring Northampton Council into disrepute" and that the sale was "opposed by museum and archaeological professionals who wish to make sure no part of Egypt's cultural history is sold off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sale of Sekhemka statue at Christie's – ICOM CIPEG expresses concern |url=http://www.heritagedaily.com/2014/07/sale-of-sekhemka-statue-at-christies-icom-cipeg-expresses-concern/104104 |work=Heritage Daily |date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The sale of artefacts to pay institutional expenses is strictly against the ethical codes of national and international heritage bodies... CIPEG is concerned that, as a consequence, a well-known masterpiece of Egyptian art may disappear into a private collection, making it inaccessible to the general public, students, and scholars. CIPEG urges the Northampton Borough Council to abandon the sale of the statue of Sekhemka, and thereby to set an example of ethical behaviour on the part of a public institution which acts as custodian for objects of world cultural importance.&lt;ref&gt;"''Statement from CIPEG, the International Committee for Egyptology in the International Council of Museums on the sale of the statue of Sekhemka''",cipEG, 9 July 2014 [http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/CIPEG-statement_final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

ICOM CIPEG also expressed concern that the sale might encourage illegal excavation and plundering of Ancient Egyptian antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian Sekhemka Statue Achieves £15m In Northampton Museum Sell Off At Christie's|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/egyptian-sekhemka-statue-achieves-15m-in-northampton-museum-sell-off-at-christies?_source=rss|work=artlyst|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Curse of Sekhemka"===
{{see also|Curse of the Pharaohs}}
In July 2013, a local politician who opposed the sale of the statue commented: "I've read there is a curse attached to Sekhemka and if it should fall on anyone, it should fall on this administration for not having the courage to change their minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Northampton Borough Council 'should be cursed' for statue sale |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/politics/northampton-borough-council-should-be-cursed-for-statue-sale-1-5295007 |work=Northampton Chronicle and Echo |date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the sale was scheduled to take place the estate office of the Marquess of Northampton's [[Castle Ashby]] caught fire leading to stories about the "Curse Of Sekhemka".&lt;ref name="heritagedailycurse"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heritagedaily.com/2014/07/the-curse-of-sekjemka-strikes-northampton-as-alan-moore-condemns-15-million-sale-of-statue/104116 | title=The curse of Sekjemka strikes Northampton as Alan Moore condemns £15 million sale of statue | work=Heritage Daily | date=11 July 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2015 | author=Brockman, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire crews from three counties fought the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge fire severely damages building at historic Castle Ashby House in Northamptonshire |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/video-huge-fire-severely-damages-building-at-historic-castle-ashby-house-in-northamptonshire-1-6168780 |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auction ===
[[Christie's]] sold the Sekhemka statue for £15.76 m at an auction on 10 July 2014 to an anonymous buyer.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The auction was briefly halted by a protester who called out that “no-one should bid or buy it...stolen property,” while a small, vocal group of Egyptian protesters demonstrated outside.&lt;ref name="heritagedailycurse" /&gt; The final auction price was almost £10 m more than Christie's guide price.&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"/&gt; The price obtained broke the existing world record for an Ancient Egyptian artwork sold at auction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reaction to sale===
The Save Sekhemka Action group described the sale as a "day of shame for Northampton", and said that selling the statue had been "the decision of one man [council leader David Mackintosh], taken against all professional advice locally, nationally and internationally"&lt;ref name="sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk"/&gt; The sale was described by the Egyptian Embassy as a "shameful and unethical act".&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; Scott Furlong, of Arts Council England, said: "It is very disappointing that the local authority committed to the sale and entered into an agreement with an auction house before our discussions with them were concluded."&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; Northampton council leader David Mackintosh said the council's share of the proceeds would be used to develop the existing museum.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 11 July 2014"/&gt; The writer [[Alan Moore]] also condemned the council's decision to sell the statue.&lt;ref name="The Guardian, 10 July 2014"/&gt;
[[The Art Fund]] commented the day after the sale:
:The Art Fund supports careful collections management, which includes responsible deaccessioning, ideally with an item being freely transferred to another body so it can remain on public display. However, in line with the Museum Association’s Code of Ethics for museums, we remain strongly opposed to deaccessioning any item for financial reasons except in exceptional circumstances, where the funds will directly benefit the museum collection and only after all other options have been explored.
: This is not the case with the sale of Sekhemka and as such, having gone against the sector's ethical guidance, it risks being stripped of its accredited status. This is therefore a financially as well as morally harmful decision for Northampton Borough Council to take. Not only will they receive only 55% of the final hammer price of £15.8m, but Northampton Museum and Art Gallery will no longer be eligible to apply to us and other major funders for funding for acquisitions, capital projects (including the planned £14m extension), and artistic or educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;"Statement about the Egyptian statue of Sekhemka", The Art Council, 11 July 2014 [http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/07/11/statement-about-the-egyptian-statue-of-sekhemka]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Arts Council]] announced that Northampton Museums' accreditation would be reviewed on 24 July 2014:
: We are saddened to hear that Northampton Borough Council has now sold Sekhemka, the Egyptian statue, from its public museum collection. It is very disappointing that the local authority committed to the sale and entered into an agreement with an auction house before our discussions with them were concluded...Those who choose to approach the sale of collections cynically or with little regard for the sectoral standards or their long-term responsibilities will only further alienate both key funders and the public who put their trust in them to care for our shared inheritance. It is of great importance that the public retain trust in museums to look after the collections held in their name. We are concerned that this trust may be undermined if disposals from public collections are seen to be driven by financial considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northampton-news-hp.co.uk/News/Northampton-News/Arts-Council-announces-date-for-review-of-Northampton-Museums-accreditation-after-sale-of-Sekhemka-statue-for-15m-20140714183552.htm#ixzz37Y4YTUxz|title=Arts Council Announces Date For Review of Northampton Museums Accreditation|work=Northampton Herald and Post|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museum loses accreditation ===
[[File:Northampton Museum front.jpg|thumb|Northampton Museum]]
On 1 August 2014, Northampton Museums had their accreditation removed by the Arts Council England, who ruled that the sale broke the required standards for museums managing their collections, rendering the museums ineligible for funding from a range of arts grants and funding bodies. The museums are excluded from future participation until at least August 2019.&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc" /&gt; Scott Furlong of the Arts Council commented: "It is always hugely regrettable when we have to exclude a museum from the Accreditation Scheme. However, it is equally important that we are robust in upholding the standards and principles which underpin the scheme and are shared by the vast majority of museums."&lt;ref name="losesaccreditationbbc" /&gt; The leader of Northampton borough council, David Mackintosh said the Arts Council decision was "disappointing" and "puzzling", and stated "We are possibly one of the only local authorities in the country with plans for a multimillion pound investment in their museum service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arts Council strips Northampton Museum of accreditation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f4763b0-197e-11e4-8730-00144feabdc0.html#axzz39A9JQg6e |work=Financial Times |author=Pickford, James |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save Sekhemka Action Group commented "This is indeed a black and shameful day for Northampton's Culture and Heritage" and that "it will mean the certain decline of both the Central and [[Abington Park#Abington Park Museum|Abington Museum]] since the loss of this statue stops the Museum Service being eligible for outside grants from the Lottery, Arts Council England and other art/cultural grant giving bodies." They said that the monetary loss through loss of accreditation is likely to be in excess of the £8m gross the council received from the sale of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Northampton Museum loses Accreditation due to Sekhemka sale |url=http://sekhemka.blogspot.co.uk/ |work=Save Sekhemka Action Group |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the Borough Council's bid for a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of £240,400 was rejected. The funding was being sought for an exhibition of designer shoes dating from the 19th century to the present. The council said it was "disappointed". The [[Museums Association]] decided to ban the council from membership for five years.&lt;ref name  = "BBC4Nov14"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-29903549 |title=Sekhemka statue: HLF rejects Northampton Council grant bid |date=4 November 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friends of Museums winds itself up ===
In September 2014, the Friends of Northampton Museums and Art Gallery decided to wind itself up after 55 years' financial and practical service to the town. The sale of the statue was partly to blame for this; the group was against the sale, though some felt it did not fall within the group's functions.&lt;ref name ="NCE 250914"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/friends-group-that-fought-northampton-borough-council-sekhemka-sale-disbands-1-6309572|title=Friends group that fought Northampton Borough Council Sekhemka sale disbands|archivedate=2 December 2014|accessdate=2 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202192254/http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/friends-group-that-fought-northampton-borough-council-sekhemka-sale-disbands-1-6309572|newspaper=Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Export licence refused ===
On 30 March 2015, British culture minister [[Ed Vaizey]] placed a four-month temporary export ban on the statue, which had been sold to an unidentified overseas buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/30/export-block-on-ancient-egyptian-statue-sold-by-northampton-council|title=Export bar on ancient Egyptian treasure sold by Northampton council|author=Caroline Davies|date=30 March 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Council said there was a chance the statue could be sold to a UK buyer if "a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made at the recommended price of £15,732,600 plus [[Value added tax|VAT]]."&lt;ref name = "exportban"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32117427|title=Export ban on £15m Egyptian Sekhemka statue sold by Northampton council|date=30 March 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as "an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property," saying that the statue should have been given back to Egypt if the council no longer wanted it.&lt;ref name = "exportban" /&gt;

On 2 October 2015, Vaizey extended the export ban until 29 March 2016, after hearing of a serious bid to raise funds to save the statue for the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-34428993|title=Serious intention to raise funds to save Sekhemka Egyptian statue|work=BBC News|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no-one made a counter-offer during this extension, in April 2016 the ban was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ancient-egyptian-sekhemka-statue-sold-by-northampton-museum-to-leave-the-country-after-no-a6968621.html|title=Ancient Egyptian statue sold by Northampton museum to leave the country after no alternative buyers come forward|work=Independent|date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group claims sale may have been illegal ===
On 21 April 2015 the Save Sekhemka Action Group said that they think that a condition of the original Deed of Gift was that the statue should never be sold, making the auction illegal. The group said that they had no intention of trying to buy the statue back but suggest that it is put on display at a major museum. It is also challenging the £6m donation from the sale proceeds to the Marquess of Northampton's family. It will also examine borough council records to determine "the legal and financial arrangements reached with the Marquis of Northampton".&lt;ref name ="BBC 21-4-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-32399404|title=Sekhemka action group to probe Northampton statue sale|date=21 April 2015|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported in October 2016 that the statue now is thought to have been exported to the United States. BBC news revealed how the council, which made £8m from the sale, had been warned by lawyers not to sell it for "financial motives".
The council said it sold the figurine to help fund a £14m extension to its museum and art gallery.&lt;ref name ="BBC 15-10-2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-37552316|title=Sekhemka reported to be in USA|date=15 October 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pack hunter''' or '''social predator''' is a [[predator]]y [[animal]] which hunts its [[prey]] by working together with other members of its [[species]].&lt;ref name="Bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bshary R., Hohner A., Ait-el-Djoudi K., Fricke H. | year=2006 | title=Interspecific communicative and coordinated hunting between groupers and giant moray eels in the Red Sea | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431 | journal=[[PLOS Biology]] | volume=4 | page=431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally animals hunting in this way are closely related, and with the exceptions of humans and chimpanzees where only males normally hunt, all individuals in a family group contribute to hunting. When hunting cooperation is across two or more species, the broader term '''cooperative hunting''' is commonly used.

A well known pack hunter is the [[gray wolf]]; humans too can be considered pack hunters. Other pack hunting mammals include [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[lion]]s, [[dwarf mongoose|dwarf]] and [[banded mongoose]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s. Avian social predators include the [[Harris's hawk]], [[butcherbird]]s, three of four [[kookaburra]] species and many [[helmetshrike]]s. There are a few cold-blooded pack hunters including simple [[arthropods]] such as [[army ant]]s, the [[goldsaddle goatfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Strübin | first1=Carine | last2=Steinegger | first2=Marc | last3=Bshary | first3=Redouan | year=2011 | title=On Group Living and Collaborative Hunting in the Yellow Saddle Goatfish (''Parupeneus cyclostomus'') | journal=Ethology | volume=117 | issue=11| pages=961–969 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01966.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally [[crocodilia|crocodiles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herpetology/herpbiology/bartram.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Pack hunting is typically associated with [[cooperative breeding]] and its concentration in the [[Afrotropical Region]] is a reflection of this.&lt;ref name="temporal"&gt;For a brief explanation see {{cite journal | last1=Rubenstein | first1=Dustin R. | last2=Lovette | first2=Irby J. | year=| title=Temporal Environmental Variability Drives the Evolution of Cooperative Breeding in Birds | journal=Current Biology | volume=17 | pages=1414–1419 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.032 | pmid=17702577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pack hunters are found in the southern African [[savanna]]s, with a notable absence in [[tropical rainforest]]s and with the exception of the wolf and [[coyote]], higher [[latitude]]s.&lt;ref name="temporal"/&gt; It is thought that either on the ancient and poor soils of the southern African savanna it is not possible for individual predators to find adequate food,&lt;ref&gt;See McMahon T. A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'' {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the environment’s inherent unpredictability due to [[El Niño Southern Oscillation|ENSO]]  or [[Indian Ocean Dipole|IOD]] events means that in very bad conditions it will not be possible to raise the young necessary to prevent declining populations from adult mortality. It is also argued that Africa's large area of continuous flat and open country, which was even more extensive while rainforest contracted during glacial periods of the Quaternary, may have helped encourage pack hunting to become much more common than on any other continent.&lt;ref&gt;Box, Hilary O.; Gibson, Kathleen R. (editors); ''Mammalian Social Learning: Comparative and Ecological Perspectives, Issue 72''; p. 266. {{ISBN|9780521031950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared pack hunting history is thought to be the main conduit through which [[humans]] formed a mutual relationship with dogs (that is, [[domestication]]), as both species are highly social and inter-dependent. Humans easily take over the dominance hierarchy of dogs as subordinates instinctively follow the “alpha” individual and dogs are accustomed to living very close together&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]; ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''; p. 155. {{ISBN|0393317552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of cooperative hunting ==
[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|Transient [[orca]]s]]

Understanding how cooperative hunting could evolve requires considering the circumstances that would make it beneficial.

=== Evolutionary models ===

==== Conventional model: Packer and Ruttan Game Theory ====
In 1988, the ecologists [[Craig Packer]] and Lore Ruttan surveyed the breadth of documented instances of cooperative hunting to make a [[evolutionary game theory|game-theoretical]] model to explain under what circumstances cooperative hunting evolves. In their model, individuals can choose one of four hunting strategies:&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''cooperator'' engages prey both when it is alone or with a companion.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[Cheating (biology)|cheater]]'' only engages when it is the first to find prey, but lets another individual make the kill if it arrives second.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[scavenger]]'' never hunts and waits for another individual to make a kill.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''solitary'' avoids others and always hunts alone.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

Each of these strategies has a certain efficiency based on the size and number of prey that can be captured in a hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

The model shows that cooperative hunting for a single large prey is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS)—a strategy that an individual adopts because failure to do so reduces its fitness—only when solitary hunting is much less efficient. This is usually due to a prey species being too large to be taken down by an individual, meaning hunting efficiency is low and hunting cost is high. In this case, the increased benefit in hunting efficiency from cooperation must compensate for the division of available meat among cooperators. Furthermore, cooperatively hunting groups are prone to invasion by cheaters and scavengers who avoid the drawbacks of hunting, so the added benefit of cooperative hunting must also outweigh these costs. Otherwise, cheating and scavenging can also be evolutionarily stable strategies. The proportion of these strategies increases in larger groups, since only a certain number of individuals are required to help make the kill, allowing others to directly benefit without participating in the hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

When a species hunts a single prey small enough to be monopolized by an individual, cooperative hunting is rarely ever an ESS since group members are in essence competing for a single meal. Unless individual prey tracking and capture efficiency is extremely low, solitary hunting is always be the dominant strategy since solitaries don't have to share their kill. Cheaters and scavengers never prosper in this situation, since the original captor monopolized all the food. The model predicts that the only way cooperative hunting is an ESS for single small prey is if the predators are already constrained to live in groups—so they must share what they get in order to keep the group stable.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

On the other hand, cooperative hunting is always an ESS when attacking multiple prey, both large and small. This is because cooperators no longer have to pay costs of dividing meat if they can each make their own kill. Another benefit is that when prey is sufficiently large it can be shared among cooperators if one member was unable to make a kill. Moreover, cheaters and scavengers only do well when hunting costs are very high, since they forgo the chance to get their own prey. In these parts of the model, cooperative hunting is always favorable, as long as there is some form of increase in net efficiency over solitary hunting. However, in their body of research, Packer and Ruttan found very few instances of this clear advantage over solitaries. They concluded that cooperative hunting in multiple prey situations is more likely to be a result of pre-existing social bonds rather than an evolutionary [[adaptation]], but that this hunting behavior is still important for establishing the social fabric of the group.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

==== Revised model: Boesch's chimpanzees ====
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Mutter kletternd.jpg|thumb|upright|A female [[chimpanzee]] must carry her young through the trees, meaning it could be put in danger if she decides to pursue prey.]]

In 1994, [[Christophe Boesch]] condensed Packer and Ruttan's model to two basic conditions and added a crucial third component based on his study of chimpanzees (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') in the [[Taï National Park]] of [[Cote d'Ivoire]]:

#For hunting to evolve, in single individuals the rewards for hunting (meat intake) exceed the costs of hunting (energy used up, injury, illness).
#For cooperative hunting to evolve, in single hunters the net gain (benefits - costs) of hunting together exceed the net gain of hunting alone.
#For cooperative hunting to remain stable, there must be some mechanism to prevent cheaters and scavengers from taking an unfair portion of the meat. Following his study of the Taï chimpanzees, Boesch showed that the meat is distributed in a manner proportional to an individual’s contribution to the hunt.&lt;ref name="Boesch 1994"/&gt;  This social mechanism is thought to prevent cheaters from destabilizing the cooperative hunting paradigm by getting more than the net benefit of hunters.  Additionally, this meat-sharing behavior is not related to the social hierarchy of the group, suggesting that it depends solely on participation in the hunt.

Curiously, in female Taï chimpanzees, cheating has become an ESS because there are substantially more costs associated with hunting, including the risk of dropping infants from trees and injuring them. Therefore, it pays females to be a bystander rather than hunt; in fact, the male strategy allows the female strategy to be stable provided the males provision their female partner with food.

On the other hand, in the chimpanzees of [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]], cooperative hunting is not a stable strategy. The predator-prey interactions differ in Gombe chimpanzees in a way that has prevented cooperative hunting from evolving.  Both Taï and Gombe chimps hunt small [[red colobus]] monkeys that live in trees; however, the trees are much smaller at Gombe such that it is very easy for one chimp to capture its prey.  At Taï, the trees are much taller (by about 30–40 meters), and it thus takes a larger effort to capture the prey. This disparity in height would favor the evolution of cooperative hunting at Taï where multiple chimps can help one another out and not at Gombe where the benefits of cooperative hunting do not outweigh the costs of meat-sharing. In fact, single hunters gain much more meat than cooperative hunters in the Gombe population.  It is therefore plausible that cooperative hunting evolved at Taï as a response to the more difficult distribution of monkeys in taller trees.

The results above suggest that social living in chimps may not be a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of cooperative hunting; instead, the distribution of resources is a critical determining factor.

=== Importance of resource distribution ===

The distribution of prey species is often the determining factor for whether populations hunt cooperatively. When prey is abundant throughout a habitat, cooperative hunting is not an effective strategy.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; Solitary hunters can easily find food on their own and do not share their kill. This case arises when prey is small enough to be captured by an individual. In contrast, when patches of prey are focused in small areas of a habitat, predators are likely to live in groups to coordinate large attacks and kill more prey.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; This strategy illustrates the importance of group living in establishing cooperative hunting efforts. In this respect, cooperative hunting is not just a function of the species, but also of its environment. Consequentially, cooperative hunting most likely evolved in areas with scarce prey distribution, and patterns of this behavior are likely to vary with seasonal fluctuation of available resources.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt;

Even species that are normally considered solitary hunters have been shown to engage in cooperative hunting when the distribution of prey makes it difficult for solitary hunters to be successful. For example, in [[aplomado falcon]]s individuals generally hunt alone when searching for [[insect]]s, as these hunts are simple and these insects are easy to find. However, the aplomado falcons generally hunt cooperatively when targeting smaller [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, as these hunts are lengthy and require high-speed chases. Thus, the decision to hunt cooperatively is often dependent upon the resource distribution in certain species.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; 

=== Implications on sociality ===
When resources are distributed in a way that supports group living, populations may develop social groups. Cooperative hunting is often a major feature of these groups, and it has been theorized that it is a primary basis for the evolution of sociality in the order [[Carnivora]].&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; While alternate theories have concluded that cooperative hunting may not be as important of a factor as [[territory (animal)|territory]] sharing and mutual protection of [[offspring]], they still agree that it plays an important role in developing social groups.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt; For example, as a result of cooperative hunting, aplomado falcons defend the nest together and share the food with offspring after the hunt.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; Cooperative hunting has thus proven to hold certain social groups together since it can be disadvantageous to hunt alone in particular situations. Future research may quantify the contribution of cooperative hunting to the evolution of sociality, as it is currently difficult to ascertain how much cooperative hunting is a cause or a consequence of social behavior.

== Adaptive significance ==
When an environment allows it, cooperative hunting can offer species a range of adaptive advantages not normally available through solitary hunting.

=== Adaptive advantages of cooperative hunting ===
There are two main goals to cooperative hunting in social carnivores: taking down large prey species through a coordinated effort and subsequently protecting their kill from scavengers.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; A common goal in cooperatively hunting pairs is to coordinate the separation of a mother and her offspring, facilitaing an easier kill that a solitary hunter could not make. Cooperative hunting is also important in species that prey on larger animals, such as [[African hunting dog]]s, as it allows them to make a kill in a safer, more efficient manner. After the kill has been made, the hunters restrict meat access to those involved in the hunt to protect their food from scavengers. This includes both strictly scavenging species and members of their own species who do not participate in the hunt. In these ways, cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages by affording species a means to make more efficient kills and by ensuring they get the maximum amount of food possible from their kill.

Another advantage of cooperative hunting is that attacking in a group allows more opportunities to make a kill before the prey scatters and gets away.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; There is also the potential to confuse the prey species so they may run into another hunter approaching from a different direction. Group attacks are particularly advantageous when prey live in concentrated groups, as hunters have a hard time tracking prey in territories outside the preferred habitat.

Higher success in prey capture has been demonstrated in wild dogs,&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt; [[bottlenose dolphins]] and other [[cetacea]]ns,&lt;ref name ="Gazda"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gazda S.K., Connor R.C., Edgar R.K., Cox F. | year=2005 | title=A division of labour with role specialization in group-hunting bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'') off Cedar Key, Florida | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume=272 | pages=135–140 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2937 | pmid=15695203 | pmc=1634948}}&lt;/ref&gt; falcons, and [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] due to cooperative hunting.  For example, aplomado falcons increase their efficiency of capture when hunting in pairs because the pairs are twice as successful as hunting alone.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; As a result, the high overall success rate of cooperative hunting leads to higher per capita meat intake even in large groups.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Watts, D. P.; Mitani J. C. | year=2002 | title=Hunting behavior of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda | doi=10.1023/a:1013270606320 | journal=International Journal of Primatology | volume=23 | pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics of group size ===
Many populations capable of forming cooperative hunting groups may not necessarily do so if their group is too small or too large for this behavior to be favorable. Group size is an important indicator of specific instances of cooperative hunting, as the prey must be large enough and the hunting group small enough to provide enough food for all individuals. Another important consideration is that when groups grow larger, there is a greater chance that individuals will engage in a cheater strategy. If there is consistently too much cheating in a group, individuals will prefer to hunt alone so they do not have to share their meal with [[free rider problem|freeloaders]].

There may be costs that set an upper limit on group size.&lt;ref name ="Creel 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Creel, S. | year=1997 | title=Cooperative hunting and group size: assumptions and currencies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=54 | pages=1319–1324 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net benefits increase as a function of pack size, as more animals in a group are theoretically able to obtain more meat.  However, in African wild dogs, researchers found that the most common group size was not the group size that maximized net benefits.&lt;ref name="Creel 1997" /&gt; Instead, because larger packs must travel farther to get more food, there are travelling costs associated with larger groups. Thus, African wild dogs optimize a more appropriate currency: the amount of meat gained per dog per kilometer traveled, instead of the amount of meat gained per dog per day as the latter does not take into account the costs of hunting.  This research successfully demonstrates that varying ecological variables are responsible for the difference in optimum group size among cooperatively hunting animals.

== Animal roles in cooperative hunting ==
Division of labor, which involves each team member performing a subtask to complete an objective, has been found in many species. It has been shown that animals that forage and hunt cooperatively in groups often adopt specialized roles during a [[hunting|hunting event]], which can vary widely among different species.  Division of labor among cooperatively hunting species occurs along a continuum, ranging from species in which individuals never differentiate into specific roles to species in which individuals specialize into different roles that they always perform throughout their lifetime.

=== African wild dogs ===
[[File:Wild dog Lycaon pictus feeding.jpg|thumb|[[African wild dogs]] eating the spoils of their hunt]]

African wild dogs participate in an intense rally ceremony before hunting. Its function is to ensure that all the members are alert and ready to hunt. They then all trot together and participate in a chase during which they pursue and harass the prey.  Instead of immediately attacking the prey, which could result in small prey immediately fleeing and large prey forming a defensive pinwheel and charging, the dogs form a defensive formation. Despite their coordinated formation, there is no clear role specialization in this species, as all individuals perform essentially the same function.&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt;

[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|Canadian Gray Wolves surrounding a bison]]

===Alaskan wolves===
Co-operation between wolves in a pack is most visible in their hunting strategy, and is highly effective. A wolf pack may trail a herd of elk, caribou or other large prey for days, looking for an animal that displays any sign of weakness, before making its move. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the pack heads towards their prey, chasing it down and then surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mech, L. David |title=The wolves of Denali |date=2003 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0816629595 |pages=196–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the attack begins the wolves have specific roles in the hunt, based on age, gender and social standing, as well as its particular experience and abilities. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haber |first1=Gordon |last2=Holleman |first2=Marybeth |title=Among wolves : Gordon Haber's insights into Alaska's most misunderstood animal |date=2013 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=9781602232181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aplomado falcons ===

[[Aplomado falcon]]s monitor each other's movements during hunts. Males and females always perform the same task in every situation.  They begin perched together and the males initiate and give a sharp "chirp" vocalization to signal for the female to follow suit.  When chasing birds on the ground, the females follow right behind the birds in the bushes and the males swoop in from overhead to make the kill. Within these pairs, males and females are consistently assigned to a particular role.&lt;ref name ="Hector" /&gt;

=== Bottlenose dolphins ===

Individual role specialization has also been observed in bottlenose dolphins.  The bottlenose dolphins form groups of three to six. One dolphin acts as the “driver” and herds the fish in circles towards the “barrier dolphins” who are tightly grouped together to form a barrier.  The driver performs fluke-slaps to cause the fish to leap into the air.  As the fish begin to leap, the driver moves next to the barrier dolphins, who all catch the fish in the air with their mouths open. Stefanie Gazda and colleagues predict that this role specialization is more common in [[marine biology|marine]] than [[terrestrial animals|terrestrial]] animals due to a higher variability in prey diversity, [[biomass]], and predator mobility in the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name ="Gazda" /&gt; One specific type of cooperative feeding behavior is [[mud ring feeding]].

[[File:DOLPHIN FIGURE (1).jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|A team of [[dolphins]] each fill a specialized role to make fish jump in the air. In this vulnerable position, they are easy prey for the dolphin team. ]]

=== Lions ===
Cooperative hunting strategy in [[lions]] is based on groups of three to seven individuals split into two highly specialized roles, centers and wings, which coordinate their movement to encircle and ambush the prey. In a line of lions, the outside individuals, also known as the wings, first run out to the sides of the intended target while the center lies in an ambush position. As the wings slowly encircle their mark, they drive the prey towards the waiting center—often one of the older and heavier individuals in the group—who then pounces to make the kill. Each individual in the group learns its preferred role during youth, whether it be center or wing. A child does not necessarily perform the same position as its mother since it learns through observing other lionesses in the pride. Individuals have also been shown to perform positions other than their natural place depending on whether another individual has already filled their role. Despite this plasticity, hunting success is greatest when every individual in the group can perform its specialized role.&lt;ref name ="Stander"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stander P.E. | year=1992 | title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=29 | pages=445–454 | doi=10.1007/bf00170175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
In Taï, chimpanzee, individuals participate as a driver, blocker, chaser, or ambusher.  Drivers follow the prey without trying to catch up with it.  Blockers place themselves in a tree to block the progression of the prey.  Chasers move quickly after the prey to catch up with it.  Finally, ambushers anticipate the escape route of the prey long enough in advance to force it back towards the chasers or down into the lower canopy.  Blocking and ambushing are thought to require much more cognitive effort in anticipating the future movements of the prey, and they are thus rewarded with a larger proportion of meat after a successful hunt. These two roles correlate positively with the age of the chimpanzee as the cognitive function necessary to perform these tasks is thought to increase with age. Furthermore, individuals can change roles during the same hunt or maintain their same role during the entire process.&lt;ref name ="Boesch 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boesch C | year=2002 | title=Cooperative hunting roles among taï chimpanzees | journal=Human Nature | volume=13 | pages=27–46 | doi=10.1007/s12110-002-1013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further examples ==
In addition to the well-documented examples of pack hunting in social carnivores, the behaviour is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

===Fossa===
[[File:Cryptoprocta ferox.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The usually solitary fossa sometimes hunts cooperatively.]]
[[Fossa (animal)|Fossa (''Cryptoprocta ferox'')]] are the first documented example of cooperative hunting in solitary species, as fossa are some of the least social carnivores.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  The fossa is the largest member of [[Madagascar]] [[mongoose]]s.  They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small [[lemurs]] and [[tenrecs]].  Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (larger lemurs) has recently gone extinct.  Larger lemurs (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500–1500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  Cooperative hunting was common to take down a prey of this size.  However, since extinction was relatively recent, cooperative hunting may have persisted even after their prey size diminished.

===Spiders===
Stegodyphid spiders (Genus ''[[Stegodyphus]]'') have been shown to act cooperatively to trap and collect insect prey species.&lt;ref name ="Packer 1988" /&gt; These social arachnids cooperate both by spinning communal webs on which to catch prey and by moving together to catch large prey in the field, such as grasshoppers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ward P.I., Enders M.M. | year=1985 | title="Conflict and Cooperation in the Group Feeding of the Social Spider" ''Stegodyphus mimosarum'' | journal=Behavior | volume=94 | pages=167–182 | doi=10.1163/156853985x00325}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spiders do not monopolize certain parts of the web, meaning any individual can use a variety of locations to lie in wait for prey. When prey is captured in the field, it usually requires at least two spiders to be brought back to the nest to be shared among the rest of the colony.

=== Humans ===

Research at Lamalera village in [[Indonesia]] has shown how cooperative hunting can develop in pre-industrial societies. This village relies on traditional whale hunting techniques for its livelihood.&lt;ref name="Alvard"/&gt;  Because whale hunting requires more than one individual, it benefits the villagers to hunt cooperatively. The hunting men cooperate either as crew members, corporate members, or craftsmen. Each performs a different duty and receives a different share of whale meat. Alvard echoes other research by suggesting that these shared norms of meat distribution sustains cooperative hunting and prevents the rise of cheaters.&lt;ref name ="Alvard"/&gt;

This research also details the importance of biological relatedness amongst a cooperative hunting group. [[Kin selection]] favours traits or behaviours that promote the survival of relatives. At Lamalera, only kin that are of the same lineage (that all descend from male relatives or all descend from female relatives) hunt together. The researchers suggest that this allows an unambiguous identification of the relatedness of other group members. 

=== Crocodylians ===
Research conducted by Vladmir Dinets has indicated that crocodylians regularly engage in cooperative hunting behavior, including highly-organized game drives. Behaviours noted by Dinets include forming tight "bait balls" when hunting fish and being able to anticipate the location and actions of other crocodiles without being able to see them for an ambush. Dinets suggests this may make crocodiles some of a small group of animals that can cooperate in such sophisticated ways.&lt;ref name="croc"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dinets, V. | year=2014 | title=Apparent coordination and collaboration in cooperatively hunting crocodilians | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=27 | pages=244–250 | doi=10.1080/03949370.2014.915432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groupers]] (''Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri'') and [[giant moray]] eels (''Gymnothorax javanicus'') provide compelling evidence for interspecific cooperative hunting.  Groupers visit moray eels at their resting places and provide visual signals (such as a head shake) to engage morays in the hunt. These associations are non-random and appear to be motivated by the hunger level of the groupers.  Groupers were able to capture prey five times more quickly with morays present because the eels could sneak through crevices and corner prey items; additionally, morays that hunted alone were never successful because they did not have a grouper present to lead them to the prey. Thus, the hunting success of groupers and giant moray eels is greater for both species than when hunting alone.&lt;ref name ="Bshary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vail"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vail, A.L.; Manica, A.; Bshary, R. |year=2013 |title=Referential gestures in fish collaborative hunting |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1765 |doi=10.1038/ncomms2781 |pmid=23612306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1150">In [[botany]], '''perennation''' is the ability of [[organism]]s, particularly [[plant]]s, to survive from one [[Germination|germinating]] season to another, especially under unfavourable conditions such as drought or winter. It typically involves development of a '''perennating organ''', which stores enough [[nutrient]]s to sustain the organism during the unfavourable season, and develops into one or more new plants the following year. Common forms of perennating organs are [[storage organs]] (e.g. [[tuber]]s and [[rhizome]]s), and [[bud]]s. Perennation is closely related with [[vegetative reproduction]], as the organisms commonly use the same organs for both survival and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Advanced Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAFiCHdrEAYC&amp;pg=PA213 |first1=Tim |last1=King |first2=Michael |last2=Reiss |page=213 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=2001 |isbn=9780174483083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quality, cost, delivery (QCD)''', sometimes expanded to '''QCDMS''' ([[Quality (business)|Quality]], [[Cost]], Delivery, [[Morale]], Safety),&lt;ref name=Gemba&gt;{{cite book|last=Imai|first=Masaaki|title=Gemba Kaizen: A Commonsense, Low-Cost Approach to Management|year=1997|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-136816-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[management]] approach originally developed to help companies  within the [[Automotive industry in the United Kingdom|British automobile sector]]. QCD analysis is used to assess different components of the [[production process]]. It also provides feedback in the form of facts and figures that help managers make logical decisions. By using the gathered data it is easier for organizations to prioritize their future goals.&lt;ref name="qcd1"&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD – Quality, Cost and Delivery|url=https://johanneswoe.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/qcd-quality-cost-and-delivery/|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QCD helps to break down one big thing into many smaller ones, which helps organize and prioritize efforts and, psychologically, prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD / Quality, Cost, Delivery|url=http://www.velaction.com/qdc-quality-delivery-cost/|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QCD is a "three-dimensional" approach. If there is a problem with even one dimension, the others will inevitably suffer as well. One dimension cannot be sacrificed for the sake of the other two.&lt;ref name="rtd"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Domingo|first1=Rene T.|title=THE QCD APPROACH TO OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT|url=http://www.rtdonline.com/BMA/MM/qcd.htm|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of QCD ==
QCD offers a method of measuring processes while being applicable to both simple and complicated business processes.  It also represents a basis for comparing businesses.  For example, a business measuring supplier delivery performance may easily compare its findings against other businesses' performance. But basically QDC altogether will be implemented as a single management in any corporate for man-power reduction.

== QCDF ==
[[Flexibility]] is often included as a measure to QCD resulting in Quality, Cost, Delivery and Flexibility (QCDF). Flexibility relates to the capacity to adapt to changes / modifications . The modifications could be in a)input quality b) output quality c) product specifications d) delivery schedules.

== Quality ==
Quality is the ability of a product or service to meet and exceed customer expectations. Customers' requirements determine the quality goals. It is almost always listed first, presumably because poor quality often results in bad business. Quality is the result of the efficiency of the entire production process formed of men, material, and machinery.

Even though quality is now seen as a [[competitive advantage]], US business organizations in the 1970s tended to focus more on cost and [[productivity]]. That approach led to a major share of the US market being captured by Japanese business organizations, which onces again proves that in order to be successful an organization has to focus on all three QCD dimensions together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomaskovic-Devey|first1=Donald|last2=Lin|first2=Ken-Hou|title=Income Dynamics, Economic Rents, and the Financialization of the U.S. Economy|journal=American Sociological Review|date=August 2011|volume=76|issue=4|pages=538–559|publisher=American Sociological Association|doi=10.1177/0003122411414827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the late 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s that the factor “quality” drastically shifted and became a strategic approach created by Harvard professor [http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6459&amp;facInfo=fea David Garvin].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garvin|first1=David A.|title=Competing on the Eight Dimensions of Quality|url=https://hbr.org/1987/11/competing-on-the-eight-dimensions-of-quality|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=3 November 2015|date=November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach focuses on preventing any mistakes and, also, puts a great emphasis on customer satisfaction.&lt;ref name="om"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operations management:Quality|url=http://mcu.edu.tw/~ychen/op_mgm/notes/part4.html|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality basis ===
Gavin lists [[eight dimensions of quality]]:&lt;ref name="Operations Strategy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operations Strategy|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Ob-Or/Operations-Strategy.html|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|pages=279–280|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Performance'''''
[[Performance]] is a product’s primary operating characteristics. For example, for a stereo those characteristics would include sound quality, surround sound, and wifi connectivity.
* '''''Conformance'''''
Conformance refers to the degree to which a certain product meets the customer’s expectations.
* '''''Special features'''''
Those are any additional features of a product or service. In other words, extras. An example of an extra could be free meals on an airplane, or free drinks at a museum visit. And for a TV, for example, it can be split screen, internet access, embedded apps etc.
* '''''Aesthetics'''''
[[Aesthetics]] refer to a product’s looks, sound, feel, smell, or taste. When it comes to aesthetics, complete customer satisfaction is simply impossible as it is very subjective. For example, one group of customers may like the smell of a certain perfume while other may find it completely repelling.
* '''''Durability'''''
The [[durability]] of a product is how long the product lasts before it has to be replaced. Durability can be improved by the usage of long-life materials or improved technology processes in manufacturing. Some products are expected to be more durable than others. Those often include home appliances and automobiles for which durability is a primary characteristic of quality.
* '''''Reliability'''''
Reliability refers to the time until a product breaks down and has to be repaired, but not replaced. This feature is very important for products that have expensive maintenance.
* '''''Serviceability'''''
"Serviceability is defined by speed, courtesy, competence and ease of repair." &lt;ref name="Operations Strategy" /&gt; Customers usually want products that are relatively quickly and easily serviceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|page=282|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Perceived quality'''''
The [[perceived quality]] may be affected by the high price or the good aesthetics of a product.

=== Product components ===
The quality of a product depends almost entirely on the quality of the supplied materials. One cannot produce a high-quality end product from low-quality components. Suppliers and manufacturers must be willing to work together in order to reduce and eliminate errors and defects, and achieve higher quality end products. SMEs should discuss with their suppliers how quality improvements can affect the overall performance of the supply chain. A properly implemented quality procedure can reduce testing, scrap, rework, etc. This could result in a reduction of production costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=Committee on Supply Chain Integration, Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design, Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research|title=Surviving supply chain integration : strategies for small manufacturers|date=2000|publisher=National Acad.Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-309-06878-9|pages=52|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/6369/chapter/8#52|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Cost of poor quality|Consequences of poor quality]] ===
* '''''Business loss'''''
Poor quality often results in unsatisfied customers which leads to business loss. In an environment where the customer can easily switch to a competitor, producing poor-quality products can be fatal to an organization.
* '''''Productivity'''''
Poor-quality products must often be reworked or scrapped entirely, which reduces the amount of usable output.
* '''''[[Quality costs|Costs]]'''''&lt;ref name="om" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Sushil|last2=Starr|first2=Martin|title=Production and operations management systems|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4665-0733-3|page=288|url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/manufacturing/9781466507340/chapter-8-quality-management/chapter_8_quality_management#X2ludGVybmFsX0J2ZGVwRmxhc2hSZWFkZXI/eG1saWQ9OTc4MTQ2NjUwNzM0MC8yNzk=|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
The biggest cost in most business organizations is the manufacturing cost. Production has a direct responsibility when it comes to controlling and reducing manufacturing cost.&lt;ref name="rtd" /&gt;

There are four basic types of [[manufacturing cost]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shim|first1=Jae K. Shim, Joel G. Siegel, Allison I.|title=Budgeting basics and beyond|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-1-118-38702-3|pages=191–202|edition=4th|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118387023.ch9/summary|accessdate=4 November 2015|doi=10.1002/9781118387023.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Raw material]]s
* [[Direct labour cost variance|Direct labour]]
* Variable overhead – production costs that increase or decrease depending on the quantity produced. For example, electricity is a variable overhead. If a company increases production, it will also increase the usage of equipment, which will result in a higher electricity bill.
* [[Fixed cost|Fixed overhead]]
Those are the production cost that stay the same even if the quantity produced increases or decreases. Those costs include:
# Salaries for employees that do not work directly on the production line (e.g. security guards, safety inspectors, etc.).
# [[Depreciation]] costs
# [[Occupancy cost]]s – property taxes, building insurance, etc.

=== Cost reduction ===

Businesses have been under the pressure to drive down costs in order to be more competitive for many years. There are many books and articles nowadays that suggest different ways of reducing costs, some of which are as follows:
* Minimizing supplier costs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berk|first1=Joseph|title=Cost reduction and optimization for manufacturing and industrial companies|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-64381-5|pages=117–124|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470643815.ch13/summary|accessdate=3 November 2015|doi=10.1002/9780470643815.ch13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adopting [[lean manufacturing]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=José Roberto Xavier|last2=Alves|first2=João Murta|title=Production management model integrating the principles of lean manufacturing and sustainability supported by the cultural transformation of a company|journal=International Journal of Production Research|date=21 April 2015|volume=53|issue=17|pages=5320|doi=10.1080/00207543.2015.1033032|id=2.3 The system of lean manufacturing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eliminating waste &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bragg|first1=Steven M.|title=The controller's function the work of the managerial accountant|date=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-1-118-26837-7|pages=423–424|edition=4th|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118268377.ch22/summary|accessdate=3 November 2015|chapter=5S ANALYSIS|doi=10.1002/9781118268377.ch22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Delivery ==
[[Logistics]] are an essential part in providing good [[Customer relationship management|customer service]] on time:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Alan Rushton, Phil Croucher, Peter|title=The handbook of logistics &amp; distribution management|date=2014|publisher=KoganPage|location=London|isbn=0-7494-6627-8|page=35|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/?id=39RZAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=management+logistics#v=onepage&amp;q=customer%20service%20and%20logistics&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voortman|first1=Craig|title=Global logistics management|date=2004|publisher=Juta Academic|location=Cape Town|isbn=0-7021-6641-3|pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logistics customer service can be separated into three elements (before, during and after delivery of the product):
* Pre-transaction elements
* Transaction elements
* Post-transaction elements

== Increasing profitability with QCD ==
There are seven measures used to increase profitability:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Anouze,|first2=Abdel Latef|last3=editors|first3=Ali Emrouznejad,|title=Strategic performance management and measurement using data envelopment analysis|date=2014|isbn=1-4666-4474-5|pages=132–133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xuCWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Delivery+schedule+achievement#v=onepage&amp;q=Delivery%20schedule%20achievement&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not right first time (NRFT) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Colin|last2=Murgatroyd|first2=Stephen J.|title=Total quality management in the public sector : an international perspective|date=1994|publisher=Open University Press|location=Buckingham, En|isbn=978-0-335-19102-4|pages=43–44|edition=[4th ]reprint.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_pREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=not+right+first+time+management#v=onepage&amp;q=not%20right%20first%20time%20management&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not getting things right the first time means wasted resources, effort and time. This all leads to excessive costs for the company and poor-quality, high-priced products for the customer. NRFT measures the quality of a product and is expressed in “number of defective parts per million”. The number of defective products is divided by the total quantity of finished products. This figure is then multiplied by 10^6 to get the number of defective parts per million.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

NRFT can be measured internally (defective parts identified within the production process) or externally (defective parts identified outside the production process (e.g. by the supplier or the customer).&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* Delivery schedule achievement (DSA)
DSA analyses how well a supplier delivers what the customer wants and when they want it. The goal is to achieve 100% on-time delivery without any special deliveries or overtime payments, which only increase the delivery cost. DSA measures the actual delivery performance against the planned delivery schedule.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
Failed deliveries include:
# "Not on time" deliveries – both late and early.
# "Incorrect quantity deliveries".
# Both "not on time" and "incorrect quantity deliveries".&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* People productivity (PP)
PP is measured by the time it takes (in staff hours) to produce a good-quality product. Obtaining high PP is only possible when:
# Most employees' work adds value to the process.
# Non-value added work is reduced as much as possible.
# Waste is completely eliminated .&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

* Stock turns (ST)
The ST ratio shows how quickly a company turns raw materials into finished, ready-to-be-sold products. The quicker the better. A low ST means that the money is tied up in stock, and the company has fewer funds to invest in other parts of its business.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

* Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)
The OEE shows how well a company uses its equipment and staff.

OEE is calculated on the base of three elements:
# Availability – compares the planned and the actual time of the process run. For example, if a machine is planned to run 100 hours a week, but in reality runs only 50, then the availability is 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
# Performance – compares the ideal output and the actual output. For example, if a certain process is planned to take 10 minutes, but actually takes 20, then the productivity is 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;
# Quality – to show the quality of a product, a company has to compare the number of good parts produced with the total parts produced. If it produces 100 parts per hour but only 50 of them are of saleable standard, then quality is running at 50%.&lt;ref name="qcd1" /&gt;

* Value added per person (VAPP)
VAPP shows how well people are used to turn raw materials into finished goods. In order to calculate VAPP, three things need to be taken into account:
#  The sales value of a unit after production (output value).
#  The raw material value of a unit before production (input value).
#  The number of direct production process employees.&lt;ref name="qcd2" /&gt;

*  Floor space utilisation (FSU) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LARSON|first1=T. NICK|last2=MARCH|first2=HEATHER|last3=KUSIAK|first3=ANDREW|title=A heuristic approach to warehouse layout with class-based storage|journal=IIE Transactions|date=April 1997|volume=29|issue=4|pages=337–348|doi=10.1080/07408179708966339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FSU measures the sales revenue generated by a square meter of factory floor space. Usually to achieve higher FSU the floor space has to be reduced. That means eliminating inventory and reducing the necessary space to a minimum.&lt;ref name="qcd2"&gt;{{cite web|title=QCD: measuring manufacturing performance|url=http://dti.gov.uk/bestpractice/assets/qcd.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20050301202411/dti.gov.uk/bestpractice/assets/qcd.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2005|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuterin''' is a potent [[antibiotics|antimicrobial]] multi-compound produced by ''[[Lactobacillus reuteri]]'', during the metabolism of [[glycerol]] to [[1,3-propanediol]] catalysed by the [[coenzyme B12]]-dependent diol dehydrase.

The '''salmon run''' is the time when [[salmon]], which have migrated from the [[ocean]], [[Aquatic locomotion|swim]] to the upper reaches of rivers where they [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] on gravel beds. After spawning, all [[Pacific salmon]] and most [[Atlantic salmon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.scot/plants-and-animals/fish/freshwater-fish/atlantic-salmon Atlantic salmon], ''[[Scottish Natural Heritage]]''. Retrieved 25 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; die, and the salmon life cycle starts over again. The annual run can be a major event for [[grizzly bears]], [[bald eagle]]s and [[Recreational fishing|sport fishermen]]. Most salmon species migrate during the fall (September through November).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://wfrc.usgs.gov/outreach/salmon.html |title = Questions and Answers About Salmon|publisher =  U.S. Geological Survey|website = Western Fisheries Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon spend their early life in rivers, and then swim out to sea where they live their adult lives and gain most of their body mass. When they have matured, they return to the rivers to spawn. Usually they return with uncanny precision to the [[Natal homing|natal]] river where they were born, and even to the very spawning ground of their birth. It is thought that, when they are in the ocean, they use [[magnetoception]] to locate the general position of their natal river, and once close to the river, that they use their sense of smell to [[Homing (biology)|home in on]] the river entrance and even their natal spawning ground.

In northwest America, salmon is a [[keystone species]], which means the impact they have on other life is greater than would be expected in relation to their [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. The death of the salmon has important consequences, since it means significant nutrients in their carcasses, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, are transferred from the ocean to terrestrial wildlife such as bears and [[riparian]] woodlands adjacent to the rivers. This has knock-on effects not only for the next generation of salmon, but to every species living in the riparian zones the salmon reach.&lt;ref name=Helfield2006 /&gt; The nutrients can also be washed downstream into [[estuaries]] where they accumulate and provide much support for estuarine breeding birds.

Most salmon are [[anadromous]], a term which comes from the Greek ''anadromos'', meaning "running upward".&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt; Anadromous fish grow up mostly in the saltwater in oceans. When they have matured they [[Fish migration|migrate]] or "run up" freshwater rivers to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] in what is called '''the salmon run'''.&lt;ref name=Moyle188&gt;[[#Moyle|Moyle]], p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Anadromous salmon are Northern Hemisphere fish that spend their ocean phase in either the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or the [[Pacific Ocean]]. They do not thrive in warm water. There is only one species of salmon found in the Atlantic, commonly called the [[Atlantic salmon]]. These salmon run up rivers on both sides of the ocean. Seven different species of salmon inhabit the Pacific (see table), and these are collectively referred to as [[Pacific salmon]]. Five of these species run up rivers on both sides of the Pacific, but two species are found only on the Asian side.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; In the early 19th century, Chinook salmon were successfully established in the Southern Hemisphere, far from their native range, in New Zealand rivers. Attempts to establish anadromous salmon elsewhere have not succeeded.&lt;ref name=Walrond/&gt;

The [[Parr (fish)|life cycle]] of an anadromous salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in the upper reaches of a stream or river. These are the salmon [[spawning]] grounds where salmon [[Fish egg|eggs]] are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called ''sac fry'' or ''alevin''. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on [[plankton]]. At this point the baby salmon are called ''fry''. At the end of the summer the fry develop into juvenile fish called ''parr''. Parr feed on small [[invertebrate]]s and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.&lt;ref name=Bley1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindberg2011/&gt;

As they approach the time when they are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called ''smolt''. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their [[osmoregulation]] to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean.&lt;ref name=SalmonTrust/&gt; Smolt also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a ''post-smolt''. Post-smolt form [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.&lt;ref name=Bley1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindberg2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SalmonTrust /&gt;

Then, in one of the animal kingdom's more extreme [[Animal migration|migrations]], the salmon return from the saltwater ocean back to a freshwater river to spawn afresh.&lt;ref name=Crossin2009/&gt;

After several years wandering huge distances in the ocean, most surviving salmon return to the same natal rivers where they were spawned. Then most of them swim up the rivers until they reach the very spawning ground that was their original birthplace.&lt;ref name=Moyle190&gt;[[#Moyle|Moyle]], p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various theories about how this happens. One theory is that there are geomagnetic and chemical cues which the salmon use to guide them back to their birthplace. The fish may be sensitive to the Earth's magnetic field, which could allow the fish to orient itself in the ocean, so it can navigate back to the [[estuary]] of its natal stream.&lt;ref name=Lohmann2008/&gt;

Salmon have a strong sense of smell. Speculation about whether odours provide homing cues go back to the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Trevanius/&gt; In 1951, Hasler hypothesised that, once in vicinity of the [[estuary]] or entrance to its birth river, salmon may use chemical cues which they can smell, and which are unique to their natal stream, as a mechanism to [[Homing (biology)|home onto]] the entrance of the stream.&lt;ref name=Hasler1951/&gt; In 1978, Hasler and his students convincingly showed that the way salmon locate their home rivers with such precision was indeed because they could recognise its characteristic smell. They further demonstrated that the smell of their river becomes imprinted in salmon when they transform into smolts, just before they migrate out to sea.&lt;ref name=Moyle190 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasler1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dittman/&gt; Homecoming salmon can also recognise characteristic smells in tributary streams as they move up the main river. They may also be sensitive to characteristic [[pheromone]]s given off by juvenile [[conspecific]]s. There is evidence that they can "discriminate between two populations of their own species".&lt;ref name=Moyle190 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Groot1986/&gt;

The recognition that each river and tributary has its own characteristic smell, and the role this plays as a navigation aid, led to a widespread search for a mechanism or mechanisms that might allow salmon to navigate over long distances in the open ocean. In 1977, Leggett identified, as mechanisms worth investigating, the use of the sun for navigation, and orientation to various possible gradients, such as temperature, salinity or chemicals gradients, or geomagnetic or geoelectric fields.&lt;ref name=Leggett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moyle191&gt;[[#Moyle|Moyle]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little evidence salmon use clues from the sun for navigation. Migrating salmon have been observed maintaining direction at nighttime and when it is cloudy. Likewise, electronically tagged salmon were observed to maintain direction even when swimming in water much too deep for sunlight to be of use.&lt;ref name=Ogura/&gt;

In 1973, it was shown that Atlantic salmon have conditioned cardiac responses to electric fields with strengths similar to those found in oceans. "This sensitivity might allow a migrating fish to align itself upstream or downstream in an ocean current in the absence of fixed references."&lt;ref name=Rommel/&gt; In 1988, researchers found iron, in the form of [[Single domain (magnetic)|single domain]] [[magnetite]], resides in the skulls of sockeye salmon. The quantities present are sufficient for [[magnetoception]].&lt;ref name=Quinn1988/&gt;

Tagging studies have shown a small number of fish don't find their natal rivers, but travel instead up other, usually nearby streams or rivers.&lt;ref name=Quinn1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tallman/&gt; It is important some salmon stray from their home areas; otherwise new habitats could not be colonized. In 1984, Quinn hypothesized there is a dynamic equilibrium, controlled by genes, between homing and straying.&lt;ref name=Quinn1984/&gt; If the spawning grounds have a uniform high quality, then natural selection should favour the descendants that home accurately. However, if the spawning grounds have a variable quality, then natural selection should favour a mixture of the descendants that stray and the descendants that home accurately.&lt;ref name=Lohmann2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn1984 /&gt;

[[File:The kype of a spawning male salmon.jpg|thumb|120px|right|The [[kype]] of a spawning male salmon]]

Prior to the run up the river, the salmon undergo profound physiological changes. [[Undulatory locomotion#Muscle architecture|Fish swim]] by contracting longitudinal red muscle and obliquely oriented white muscles. Red muscles are used for sustained activity, such as ocean migrations. White muscles are used for bursts of activity, such as bursts of speed or jumping.&lt;ref name=Kapoor/&gt; As the salmon comes to end of its ocean migration and enters the estuary of its natal river, its energy metabolism is faced with two major challenges: it must supply energy suitable for swimming the river rapids, and it must supply the sperm and eggs required for the reproductive events ahead. The water in the estuary receives the freshwater discharge from the natal river. Relative to ocean water, this has a high chemical load from surface runoff. Researchers in 2009 found evidence that, as the salmon encounter the resulting drop in salinity and increase in olfactory stimulation, two key metabolic changes are triggered: there is a switch from using red muscles for swimming to using white muscles, and there is an increase in the sperm and egg load. "Pheromones at the spawning grounds [trigger] a second shift to further enhance reproductive loading."&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

The salmon also undergo radical morphological changes as they prepare for the spawning event ahead. All salmon lose the silvery blue they had as ocean fish, and their colour darkens, sometimes with a radical change in hue. Salmon are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], and the male salmon develop canine-like teeth and their jaws develop a pronounced curve or hook (''[[kype]]''). Some species of male salmon grow large humps.&lt;ref name=DFWa/&gt;

Salmon start the run in peak condition, the culmination of years of development in the ocean. They need high swimming and leaping abilities to battle the rapids and other obstacles the river may present, and they need a full sexual development to ensure a successful spawn at the end of the run. All their energy goes into the physical rigours of the journey and the dramatic morphological transformations they must still complete before they are ready for the spawning events ahead.

The run up the river can be exhausting, sometimes requiring the salmon to battle hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids. They cease feeding during the run.&lt;ref name=Moyle188 /&gt; Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho must travel {{convert|900|mi|km}} and climb nearly {{convert|7000|ft|m}} before they are ready to spawn. Salmon deaths that occur on the upriver journey are referred to as ''en route mortality''.&lt;ref name=Jeffries2011/&gt;

Salmon negotiate [[waterfall]]s and [[rapid]]s by leaping or jumping. They have been recorded making vertical jumps as high as 3.65 metres (12&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=Beach1984/&gt; The height that can be achieved by a salmon depends on the position of the [[standing wave]] or [[hydraulic jump]] at the base of the fall, as well as how deep the water is.&lt;ref name=Beach1984 /&gt;

[[Fish ladder]]s, or fishways, are specially designed to help salmon and other fish to bypass dams and other man-made obstructions, and continue on to their spawning grounds further upriver.&lt;ref name=MichiganDNR/&gt; Data suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Silva |first=Sergio |last2=Lowry |first2=Maran |last3=Macaya-Solis |first3=Consuelo |last4=Byatt |first4=Barry |last5=Lucas |first5=Martyn C. |date=2017 |title=Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages?

Skilled predators, such as [[bear]]s, [[bald eagle]]s and [[Recreational fishing|fishermen]] can await the salmon during the run. Normally solitary animals, [[grizzly bear]]s congregate by streams and rivers when the salmon spawn.&lt;ref name=Helfield2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hilderbrand/&gt; Predation from [[Harbor seals]], [[California sea lions]], and [[Steller sea lions]], can pose a significant threat, even in river ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/marine-mammals/seals-and-sea-lions/upload/cr-pinniped-fs.pdf |date=March 2008 |title=Seal &amp; Sea Lion Facts of the Columbia River &amp; Adjacent Nearshore Marine Areas |publisher=[[NOAA]] |access-date=2012-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723020046/http://www.nwr.noaa.gov/Marine-Mammals/Seals-and-Sea-Lions/upload/CR-Pinniped-FS.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90213669 |title=Endangered Seals Eating Endangered Salmon |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[Bryant Park Project]] |date=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American black bear|Black bear]]s also fish the salmon. Black bears usually operate during the day, but when it comes to salmon they tend to fish at night.&lt;ref name=Klinka2009a/&gt; This is partly to avoid competition with the more powerful brown bears, but it is also because they catch more salmon at night.&lt;ref name=Reimchen2009/&gt; During the day, salmon are very evasive and attuned to visual clues, but at night they focus on their spawning activities, generating acoustic clues the bears tune into.&lt;ref name=Klinka2009a /&gt; Black bears may also fish for salmon during the night because their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. In 2009, researchers compared the foraging success of black bears with the white-coated [[Kermode bear|spirit bear]], a [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphed]] subspecies of the black bear. They found the spirit bear had no more success catching salmon at night time, but had greater success than the black bears during the day.&lt;ref name=Klinka2009b/&gt;

[[Otter]]s are also common predators. In 2011, researchers showed that when otters predate salmon, the salmon can "sniff them out". They demonstrated that once otters have eaten salmon, the remaining salmon could detect and avoid the waters where otter faeces was present.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetEarth/&gt;

The term ''prespawn mortality'' is used to refer to fish that arrive successfully at the spawning grounds, and then die without spawning. Prespawn mortality is surprisingly variable, with one study observing rates between 3% and 90%.&lt;ref name=Jeffries2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilhousen1990/&gt; Factors that contribute to these mortalities include high temperatures,&lt;ref name=Crossin2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrell/&gt; high river discharge rates,&lt;ref name=Rand/&gt; and parasites and diseases.&lt;ref name=Gilhousen1990 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; However, "at present there are no reliable indicators to predict whether an individual arriving at a spawning area will in fact survive to spawn."&lt;ref name=Jeffries2011 /&gt;

The eggs of a female salmon are called her [[roe]]. To lay her roe, the female salmon builds a spawning nest, called a ''redd'', in a riffle with gravel as its [[streambed]]. A [[riffle]] is a relatively shallow length of stream where the water is turbulent and flows faster. She builds the redd by using her tail ([[caudal fin]]) to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, and excavating a shallow depression.  The redd may contain up to 5,000 eggs, each about the size of a pea, covering {{convert|30|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt; The eggs usually range from orange to red. One or more males will approach the female in her redd, depositing his sperm, or milt, over her eggs.&lt;ref name="USFWS"/&gt; The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd. The female will make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.&lt;ref name="USFWS" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DFWb/&gt;

Male pink salmon and some sockeye salmon develop pronounced humps just before they spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in the image on the right. Predators, such as bears, will be more likely to catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.&lt;ref name=Groot1991 /&gt;

Dominant male salmon defend their redds by rushing at and chasing intruders. They butt and bite them with the canine-like teeth they developed for the spawning event. The kypes are used to clamp around the base of the tail ([[caudal peduncle]]) of an opponent.&lt;ref name=Groot1991 /&gt;

The condition of the salmon deteriorates the longer they remain in fresh water. Once the salmon have spawned, most of them deteriorate rapidly and die. This programmed [[senescence]] is "characterized by [[immunosuppression]] and organ deterioration."&lt;ref name=Jeffries2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dickhoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finch/&gt; The [[Pacific salmon]] is the classic example of a semelparous animal. It lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. [[Semelparous]] animals spawn once only in their lifetime. Semelparity is sometimes called "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners.&lt;ref name=Ricklefs/&gt; Most [[Atlantic]] salmon also die after spawning, but not all. About 5 to 10%, mostly female, return to the ocean where they can recover and spawn again.&lt;ref name=SalmonTrust /&gt;

In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon is a [[keystone species]], supporting wildlife from birds to bears and otters.&lt;ref name=Willson/&gt;  The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the [[forest ecosystem]].

[[Grizzly bear]]s function as [[ecosystem engineer]]s, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and faeces and partially eaten carcasses. It has been estimated that bears leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor,&lt;ref name=Reimchen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn2009/&gt; in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare,&lt;ref name=Reimchen2002/&gt; providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands.&lt;ref name=Helfield2006 /&gt; The foliage of [[Picea glauca|spruce trees]] up to {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.&lt;ref name=Helfield2006 /&gt;

Wolves normally hunt for deer. However, a 2008 study shows that, when the salmon run starts, the wolves choose to fish for salmon, even if plenty of deer are still available.&lt;ref name=Darimont/&gt; "Selecting benign prey such as salmon makes sense from a safety point of view. While hunting deer, wolves commonly incur serious and often fatal injuries. In addition to safety benefits we determined that salmon also provides enhanced nutrition in terms of fat and energy."&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily2008 /&gt;

The upper reaches of the [[Chilkat River]] in Alaska has particularly good spawning grounds. Each year these attract a run of up to half a million [[chum salmon]]. As the salmon run up the river, [[bald eagle]]s arrive in their thousands to feast at the spawning grounds. This results in some of the world's largest congregations of bald eagles. The number of participating eagles is directly correlated with the number of spawning salmon.&lt;ref name=Hansen2008/&gt;

Residual nutrients from salmon can also accumulate downstream in estuaries. A 2010 study showed the density and diversity of many estuarine breeding birds in the summer "were strongly predicted by salmon [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in the autumn."&lt;ref name=Field/&gt; Anadromous salmon provide nutrients to these "diverse assemblages ... ecologically comparable to the migrating herds of wildebeest in the [[Serengeti]]".&lt;ref name=Reimchen2002 /&gt;

'''Starlight''' is the [[light]] emitted by [[stars]].&lt;ref name=krob/&gt; It typically refers to [[visible spectrum|visible]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] from stars other than the [[Sun]] observable from Earth during the [[night time]] although a component of starlight is observable from the Earth during the [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]].

[[Sunlight]] is the term used for the Sun's starlight observed during daytime.  During nighttime, [[albedo]] describes solar reflections from other Solar System objects including [[moonlight]].

==Observation==

Observation and measurement of starlight through telescopes is the basis for many fields of [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=mac&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O80YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=Starlight+astronomy |first=Hector |last=Macpherson |title=The romance of modern astronomy |date=1911 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; including photometry and stellar spectroscopy.&lt;ref name=hearn/&gt; [[Hipparchus]] did not have a telescope or any instrument that could measure apparent brightness accurately, so he simply made estimates with his eyes. He sorted the stars into six brightness categories, which he called magnitudes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Astronomy''. https://d3bxy9euw4e147.cloudfront.net/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Astronomy-Draft-20160817.pdf: Rice University. 2016. p. 761. {{ISBN|1938168283}}- via Open Stax.&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to the brightest stars in his catalog as first-magnitudes stars, which were the brightest stars and those so faint he could barely see them were sixth-magnitude stars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Starlight is also a notable part of [[personal experience]] and human [[culture]], impacting a diverse range of pursuits including  poetry,&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fag_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Starlight+composition Wells Hawks Skinner – ''Studies in literature and composition for high schools, normal schools, and ...'' (1897) – Page 102] (Google eBook link)&lt;/ref&gt; astronomy,&lt;ref name="mac" /&gt; and military strategy.&lt;ref name="mort"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HNgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Starlight+army Popular Mechanics – Jan 1969 – "How the Army Learned to See in the Dark" by Mort Schultz] (Google Books link)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army]] spent millions of dollars in the 1950s and onward to develop a [[starlight scope]], that could amplify starlight, moonlight filtered by clouds, and the [[fluorescence]] of rotting [[vegetation]] about 50,000 times to allow a person to see in the night.&lt;ref name=mort/&gt; In contrast to previously developed active infrared system such as ''sniperscope'', it was a passive device and did not require additional light emission to see.&lt;ref name=mort/&gt;

The average color of starlight in the [[observable universe]] is a shade of yellowish-white that has been given the name  [[Cosmic Latte]]. 
 
Starlight spectroscopy, examination of the stellar spectra, was pioneered by [[Joseph Fraunhofer]] in 1814.&lt;ref name=hearn&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iCs4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Starlight+spectrum_BIH-8Aag9tjwDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Starlight%20spectrum&amp;f=false  J. B. Hearnshaw – ''The analysis of starlight: one hundred and fifty years of astronomical spectroscopy '' (1990) – Page 51] (Google Books link)&lt;/ref&gt; Starlight can be understood to be composed of three main spectra types, ''continuous spectrum'', ''emission spectrum'', and ''absorption spectrum''.&lt;ref name=krob&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wkIOzagyQmAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Starlight+spectrum Keith Robinson – ''Starlight: An Introduction to Stellar Physics for Amateurs'' (2009) – Page 38-40] (Google Books Link)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oldest starlight==

One of the oldest stars yet identified (oldest not most distant in this case) was identified in 2014, the star SMSS J031300.362670839.3 was determined to be 6000 light years away but date to 13.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/24625-oldest-star-universe-discovery.html|title=Ancient Star May Be Oldest in Known Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starlight shining on Earth would include this star.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;

==Photography==

In the field of photography, there is a specialty of night-time photography especially when subjects are lit primarily by starlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7QNrgEACAAJ&amp;dq=starlight+photography |title=Sierra Starlight: The Astrophotography of Tony Rowell|first=Tony|last=Rowell|date=2 April 2018|publisher=Heyday|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directly taking images of night sky is also a part of [[astrophotography]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6zMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Scientific Photography and Applied Imaging|first=Sidney|last=Ray|date=23 October 2015|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starlight astrophotography can also be used for the pursuit of science and/or leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6zMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=starlight+photography |title=Scientific Photography and Applied Imaging|last=Ray|first=Sidney|date=2015-10-23|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9781136094385|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6zMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=starlight+photography |title=Scientific Photography and Applied Imaging|last=Ray|first=Sidney|date=2015-10-23|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781136094385|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starlight photography can be important for observing [[nocturnal animals]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In many cases starlight photography may also overlap with a need to understand the impact of [[moonlight]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

'''Thematic structure''' is a concept in [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roca |first=I. M. |year=1992 |title=Thematic Structure: Its Role in Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110134063}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people talk, there are purposes in three separable parts of utterances, the act of speech, the [[Proposition|propositional content]] and the thematic structure. Because speaking is cooperative, in order that the speaking can be effective in the [[conversation]], speakers have to pay attention to their listeners’ knowledge, state of mind and level of understanding. Speakers can assume that listeners know or do not know what speakers are talking about. 

According to [[Michael Halliday]], the speakers’ judgements about the listeners’ current mental states are reflected in what is called the thematic structure used. 

The thematic structure has three main functions:
*To convey given information and new information
*To subject and predicate
*To frame and insert

A thematic structure is a preoccupying conception of a proposition which runs throughout a media text, usually around an initiating topic. It strategically ties together a number of more specific conception or statements on the basis of particular social forms of knowledge and social forms of perception and belief. A thematic structure helps to make a media text coherent -- it orients a text around a central theme of a strand of related themes running through a story.  (reference: David Deacon(2007), Researching communications,p174)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8915">The '''Whiteshell Laboratories''', originally known as the '''Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment''', was an [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|Atomic Energy of Canada]] (AECL) laboratory in [[Manitoba]], northeast of [[Winnipeg]]. It was originally built as a home for the experimental [[WR-1]] reactor, but over time came to host a variety of experimental systems, including a [[SLOWPOKE reactor]] and the [[Underground Research Laboratory]] to study [[nuclear waste]] disposal. Employment peaked in the early 1970s at about 1,300, but during the 1980s the experiments began to wind down, and in 2003 the decision was made to close the site. {{Asof|2017}} the site is undergoing decommissioning with a planned completion date in 2024.

==History==
In the late 1950s, [[Atomic Energy Canada Limited]] (AECL) was planning an aggressive expansion of their experimental reactor designs. Among a number of proposals were versions of the [[heavy water reactor]] concept using alternate cooling arrangements including [[oil]] and boiling water. Their existing research site at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] outside [[Ottawa]] appeared to be "at saturation" and too small to host all the planned experiments.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=2}}

Considering their options, it was noted that only three provinces did not already host some sort of major federal lab, [[Newfoundland]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. Newfoundland was eliminated, and Alberta already had an oil and gas industry and did not need more energy experiments. So, the decision was made to build in Manitoba. A preliminary site survey was carried out by Shawinigan Engineering (later part of [[Lavalin]], today part of [[SNC-Lavalin]]). This was followed by meetings between AECL president J.L. Gray and Manitoba premier [[Dufferin Roblin]].{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}}

In November 1959, Gray reported to the AECL board that a site on the [[Winnipeg River]] near the [[Seven Sisters Generating Station]] appeared to be suitable, along with a report from the federal government's housing agency that a new town site could be developed nearby. As the town was on the border of the [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]], they named the lab Whiteshell.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=5}} Manitoba was responsible for building a new bridge over the Winnipeg River and maintaining roads and other services. The town was developed as [[Pinawa]], some distance to the southeast of the lab site.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}}

A deal was signed on 21 July 1960, creating the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (WNRE).{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}} The site was selected to host the Organic-Cooled Deuterium-Reactor Experiment (OCDRE),{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=2}} which later became known as [[WR-1]]. The design needed to be ready for construction to start in April 1962. General Electric Canada built the reactor over a period of three years ending in June 1965, and the reactor achieved criticality on 1 November 1965. The idea of an oil-cooled version of the [[CANDU]] was eventually abandoned in 1972, and from then on the WR-1 was operated at low power settings in a purely experimental program.

Whiteshell led the development of the [[SLOWPOKE reactor]], starting in 1967. However, the first example, SLOWPOKE-1, was built at Chalk River and reached criticality in 1970. Over the next decade, several SLOWPOKE-2 reactors were sold around the world. A larger version, SLOWPOKE-3, was designed to supply 10,000&amp;nbsp;kW of hot water for [[district heating]]. The SLOWPOKE Demonstration Reactor (SDR) was built at Whiteshell in the early 1980s to test this concept. The project was terminated after market interest in a nuclear heating system dwindled. Other major facilities included shielded hot cell facilities, research laboratories and radioactive waste management areas including the Whiteshell Used Fuel Storage Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/mycommunity/facilities/pinawawhiteshell/ |accessdate=2012-07-26 |title=Whiteshell labs |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, AECL began an extensive program in [[nuclear waste]] disposal. Their general program would involve burial to shield the fuel for about three hundred years while the majority of the [[gamma ray]] sources burned out, followed by a much longer period of physical isolation, not necessarily underground, to ensure the remaining radionuclides did not enter the water supply. AECL eventually decided the entire waste storage period should be underground. They found a suitable test site in [[Canadian Shield]] rock about 50&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the main Whiteshell site. This led to the construction of the [[Underground Research Laboratory]] (URL) whose primary concern was measuring the stability of hard-rock burial and potential groundwater exchange. The facility was decommissioned and deliberately flooded in 2010 to perform one final experiment to examine how mine seals work in a water environment.&lt;ref name="freepress"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/whiteshell-labs-closes-underground-facility-forever-111511344.html|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=October 11, 2014|title=Whiteshell labs closes underground facility forever |work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other programs on the main site included the '''Containment Test Facility''' (CTF) that examined potential [[hydrogen]] explosion sources in the CANDU reactors, and the '''Large-Scale Vented Combustion Test Facility''' (LSVCTF) that examined the actual explosions. Work at these sites concluded that by following some basic precautions the possibility of such an explosion in a CANDU was remote, and was used to test the '''[[Passive autocatalytic recombiner|Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners]]''' (PAR) system developed to scavage trace amounts of hydrogen that might be present. The PAR would go on to be a successful export product for AECL.

Starting in 1984, Whiteshell began a collaboration with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) to develop a [[nuclear battery]] for powering the [[North Warning System]] radars. This developed into an active generator using an [[Organic Rankine cycle]] generator.

Whiteshell ran a number of life sciences programs over the years. In 1966, two 19&amp;nbsp;m diameter plastic-lined "ponds" were built, one of which held a cesium-137 source. The ten-year program measured the spread of the caesium in the water, and by comparing the two ponds, its effect on the life forms in them. In 1973 they constructed the Field Irradiator Gamma (FIG) experiment, which fenced off a 1&amp;nbsp;km area of forest and exposed it to a powerful cesium-137 [[gamma radiation]] source in a central tower. The program ran until 1986, and concluded that it required 100,000 times the natural background to kill pine trees. A similar experiment started the next year in 1974, the ZEUS (Zoological Environment Under Stress) experiment, which set aside six 1-hectare meadow areas in 1974 and carried out long-term radioactive releases to measure the results. They were mostly interested in the effects on [[meadow vole]]s, but did not reach any conclusions.

In 1998, AECL decided to close Whiteshell Laboratories and many of the facilities and activities have since ceased active operation. {{asof|2017}}, many of the original facilities are shut down, but work on WR-1 is ongoing. The site is planned to be entirely decomiisioned by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/environmental-stewardship/whiteshell/default.aspx |title= Whiteshell Decommissioning |website=Canadian Nuclear Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wiel Arets''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋil ˈaːrəts}}, born {{Birth date|1955|05|06|df=y}}) is a Dutch [[architect]], [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], [[urbanist]], [[industrial designer]] and the former [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the College of Architecture at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]], in the [[United States of America]]. Arets was previously the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany, and studied at the [[Eindhoven University|Technical University of Eindhoven]], graduating in 1983.One year later he founded [[Wiel Arets Architects]], a multidisciplinary [[architecture]] and [[design]] studio (moved to Maatrich in 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mchmaster.com/faculty/wiel-arets/|title=Wiel Arets|website=www.mchmaster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays with offices located throughout [[Europe]]. From 1995-2002 he was the Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] in [[Rotterdam]], where he introduced the idea of 'progressive-research' and co-founded the school's architectural journal named ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Life and career==
Wiel Arets was born on 6 May 1955 in [[Heerlen]], [[Netherlands]] to Wiel Arets (1929) and Mia Heuts (1931). His father was a book printer and his mother was a [[fashion designer]], both from whom he learned respect for the tradition of [[craft]] and a love of books and reading.&lt;ref name=STILLS&gt;{{cite book

  | date= December 2010 |isbn=978 90 6450 764 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly studied [[engineering]], and then [[physics]], before ultimately deciding on architecture. He divides his time between [[Chicago]], [[Maastricht]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Zürich]], living and working in each city. He is married and has two children. Arets' work is generally characterized by a [[minimalist]], geometric and austere approach that responds to local contingencies in a flexible way, with Arets explaining: &lt;blockquote&gt;'We want our buildings to fit into the existing context, yet remain flexible and open to change'.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. "AA Files No. 21". Architectural Association London, 1991, pp.16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his studies at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) Arets became fascinated by the works and words of [[Paul Valéry]], [[Giorgio Grassi]] and Cesare Cattaneo, quickly developing his admiration for 'the dialogue' as an operative method, best exemplified by [[Paul Valéry|Valéry's]] 'Eupalinos' and Cattaneo's 'Giovanni e Giuseppe'.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; While studying Arets co-founded the architectural journal ''Wiederhall'' and organized a series  of visiting lecturers at the TU/e that included the architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Tadao Ando]] and [[Peter Eisenmann]], among others. Subsequently, Arets organized the first European exhibition of [[Tadao Ando|Tadao Ando's]] work.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; It was during this period that Arets 'rediscovered' the work of Dutch architect [[Frits Peutz]], who transformed the city of Heerlen from an industrial coal mining hub and into a modern city through his many built commissions funded by the [[coal]] industry, most recognizably the [[Glaspaleis]]. With the decline of industry the city lost most of its status as an industrial area in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and Frits Peutz faded from architectural prominence.

As a student Arets undertook extensive research in the archives of Peutz's office, eventually producing the monograph 'F.P.J Peutz Architekt 1916-1966' (1981) and an accompanying traveling exhibition.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; After graduating from the TU/e in 1983 Arets travelled extensively throughout Russia, the United States and Japan. While in Japan Arets visited and interviewed several prominent architects including [[Fumihiko Maki]], [[Kazuo Shinohara]], [[Itsuko Hasegawa]] and [[Tadao Ando]], later publishing these interviews and articles in the Dutch architecture magazine ''de Architect''.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; Arets first garnered international architectural attention with the completion of the [[Academie Beeldende Kunsten Maastricht|Maastricht Academy of Art and Architecture]] in 1993, described by [[Kenneth Frampton]] as: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Revitalizing an existing institution within the old urban core in such a way as to transform both the institution and the urban fabric...All of this was achieved without abandoning for the moment the minimalist expression of an architecture degree zero, derived in part from [[Sol LeWitt]] and in part from [[Tadao Ando]].'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Utrecht University library.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Utrecht University Library|nl|3=Universiteitsbibliotheek Utrecht}}]]
In 2004 Arets completed the [[library]] of [[Utrecht University]], situated in the [[Uithof]] area of the campus designed by [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]] which dictated a strict orthogonal requirement for all buildings. The library's exterior glazing is screen printed with an image of bamboo shoots created by the photographer [[Kim Zwarts]], returning as a tactile imprinted surface pattern on the library's interior prefabricated concrete panel walls, which are painted black. This 'tactility' has since returned to more of Arets' projects in the form of imprinted-concrete or screen printed glass exteriors.&lt;ref name=LivingLibrary/&gt; [[Kazuyo Sejima]] of [[SANAA]] remarks of the library:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The building is fascinating in many ways, but most of all I feel some warm humanism from it. Within its crisp black envelope Wiel Arets has carved out an arsenal of different spaces&amp;nbsp;– some low, some high, some wide, some spacious, some compressed, some bright, some dark. This is a building that would never appear dull. It offers a moment for everyone.'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 Arets' studio won an international competition to design the IJhal at [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Amsterdam Centraal Station]], part of the city's plan to revitalize the waterfront by reconnecting it to the river [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Theoretical position==
In 1991 Arets published his first theoretical text, 'An Alabaster Skin', in a monograph of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. ''An Alabaster Skin''. 010 Publishers, 1991, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The text merged Arets' fascinations of his studies and early career, including: [[cinematography]], [[photography]], the '[[city]]', technology of the 20th century, the membrane or [[skin]] of a building, [[biology]] and the act of [[cutting]] and [[editing]] (in regards to cinematography), as well as the [[Postmodern architecture]] of the 1980s. [[Greg Lynn]] interprets the piece as so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'A precedent for this [[alabaster]] [[urbanism]] is [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill|Skidmore Owings and Merrill’s]] [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Library]] at [[Yale University]] that utilizes an alabaster curtain wall that breaks down the boundary between the interior and exterior without transparency. Light is admitted from the outside during the day and the interior emanates a glowing light at night. The polished surface of the blank curtain wall reflects the adjacent buildings while allowing permeability. Likewise, in Arets’ work there is the stealth of a [[chameleon]].'&lt;ref name="autogenerated40"&gt;Lynn, Greg. ''Maastricht Academy for the Arts and Architecture''. 010 Publishers, 1994, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Teaching==
Arets was Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] from 1995-2002 where he changed the school to a research based institute focusing on 'progressive-research', public lectures, publications, field trips, and intensive debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlage-institute.nl/persons/wiel_arets |title=Wiel Arets / Persons / The Berlage |publisher=Berlage-institute.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that position he was and is a professor or guest professor at many architecture schools, mostly within [[Europe]] and the United States, and was until 2012 the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.udk-berlin.de/arets ] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the UdK 'Tokyo Utopia/TOUT',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastercollectivehousing.com/tag/wiel-arets/ |title=Wiel Arets - Master of Architecture MCH |publisher=Mastercollectivehousing.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Arets' research theme, and he has previously used other research themes, such 'Double Dutch', to structure output and debate while teaching; they often return to give content and context to publications such as ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the importance of such a 'progressive-research' based theme Arets states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'That's why, when I became Dean, I changed the name to the [[Berlage Institute|Berlage Institute Laboratory for Architecture]], I wanted to invite people to come do their research alongside students and to publish their work with the studios. The research, the production of the students, the publication, the seminars, the field trips, the lectures that were happening&amp;nbsp;– all had to be part of one thing. I think laboratory simply means you have a theme, and you collectively do investigations and research. And then, at the end of the year, you have a result, which is presented in the school's publication, ''HUNCH'', which was originally edited by [[Jennifer Sigler]]. This was, and still is, not just a publication of only student work; rather, ''HUNCH'' was where we also published the work of guest lecturers, the important research of the trips, and everything we thought belonged to the year theme.'&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
