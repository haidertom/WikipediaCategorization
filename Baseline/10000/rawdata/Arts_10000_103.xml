In [[Christian art]], animal forms have at times occupied a place of importance. With the [[Renaissance]], animals were nearly banished, except as an accessory to the human figure. Modern Christian art only revives symbols and decoration.

==Late Antique period==

In the early days of Latin and Byzantine Christianity, as well as in the period of its full bloom in the Middle Ages, a prodigious number of representations of animals is found not only in [[monumental sculpture]], but in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, in [[stained glass window]]s, and in [[tapestry]] as well. Three reasons may be given for this unexampled fondness for animal life:&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|wstitle=Animals in Christian Art}} The entry cites:
**[[James Spencer Northcote]] and W. R. Brownlow, ''Roma Sotterranea'' (London, 1870);
**Lübke, ''History of Sculpture'' (London, 1872);
**Barbet de Jouy, ''Les mosaiques chrétiennes'' (Paris, 1863);
**Francis Bond, ''Gothic Architecture in England'' (London, 1906);
**[[Viollet-le-Duc]], ''Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XI au XVI siècle'' (Paris, 1858);
**De Baudot, ''La sculpture française au moyen âge et la renaissance'' (Paris, 1885).&lt;/ref&gt;

# It affords an easy medium of expressing or symbolizing a virtue or a vice, by means of the virtue or vice usually attributed to the animal represented.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;
# Animal forms were traditional elements of decoration.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; 
# Medieval designers returned to the direct study of nature, including man, the [[Great chain of being|lower animals]], and the humblest plants.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

===Symbolic animals from the catacombs===
[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|upright|Christian souls as [[domestic sheep|lambs]] accompanying the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]].  San Callisto catacomb, Rome. 3rd century]]
{{further|Catacombs of Rome}}

The paintings of the first period, as seen in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], show us, usually, the [[domestic sheep|lamb]] accompanying the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], a representation of the Christian soul during its earthly life.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; The lamb was strongly associated with religious sacrifices in the ancient Near East, and was adopted as a symbol of Christ and his sacrifice on behalf of humanity.&lt;ref name="MMA2012"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boehm |first1=Barbara Drake |last2=Holcomb |first2=Melanie |title=Animals in Medieval Art |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/best/hd_best.htm |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds, too, appear either as simple decorative elements transmitted from antique paintings, or used symbolically as in [[Noah]]'s dove, symbolical of the Christian soul released by death; the [[peacock]], with its ancient meaning of [[immortality]], and the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the symbol of [[apotheosis]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; 

The symbol of perhaps the widest distribution is the ''[[Ichthys]]'' (Greek: ΙΧΘΥΣ, fish), used since the second century as an acronym for "Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ" (Iesous Christos, Theou Huios, Soter), meaning "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".&lt;ref name="Coffman2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/asktheexpert/oct26.html |first=Elesha |last=Coffman |title=What is the origin of the Christian fish symbol? |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, these various representations are somewhat crude, and show the decadence of the pagan art of the time.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

===Animals from the Book of Revelation===
{{further|Book of Revelation}}

After the [[Edict of Milan|recognition of the Church]] by [[Constantine I]] in 313, the [[Book of Revelation]] is the source from which are derived most of the decorative themes of Christian Art. The lamb is now the most important of these, and its meaning is either the same as before or, more frequently perhaps, it is symbolic of Christ the expiatory victim. The dove is the Holy Spirit, and the four animals that St. John saw in Heaven&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, 4, v&lt;/ref&gt; are used as personifications of the [[Four Evangelists]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j0UmWBivNJgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Jerome+eagle+John&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8XpvT_69McO30QXb7KCOAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jerome%20eagle%20John&amp;f=false Jerome, Preface to Commentary on Matthew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Male, Emile. ''The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 35–7, English trans. of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions), {{ISBN|978-0064300322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Byzantine art, a great variety of fantastic animals, such as [[dragon]]s, birds with human heads, [[winged lion]]s, etc., entwined themselves around the decorative forms until foreign wars and the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast movement]] brought this period of vigorous art to an end.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

==Middle Ages==

===Fantastic and composite animals===

During the succeeding three centuries, it is only in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings that we find new types of animals. These are usually either purely fantastic or composite, that is, made up of elements of different species combined in one. Often, the subject grows out of foliage forms; and monsters are shown fighting and even devouring one another.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt; 

===Specific symbols===
[[File:France Arles St Trophime Portal Detail.jpg|thumb|The symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]] around the glorified Christ, [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles|St Trophime, Arles]], 12th century]]
{{further|Four Evangelists}}

In the [[spandrel]]s of the entrance doorways, around the glorified Christ, the symbols of the four evangelists, namely the [[lion]], the [[ox]], the man, and the [[eagle]] are shown, holding the holy books. This is a favourite motif in the sculpture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Sometimes the jaws of a monster figure the entrance of [[Hell]], into which sinners are plunged.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

===Symbolic animals from bestiaries===
{{further|Bestiary}}

With the beginning of the thirteenth century [[Gothic art]] affords the greatest number and the best representations of animal forms. The great [[cathedrals]], especially those of the [[Île-de-France|Isle of France]], where sculpture reached its highest point of excellence, are a sort of encyclopedia of the knowledge of the time. They show, therefore, examples of all the then known animals, that is, whether by legend or experience. The [[bestiaries]], developed in the twelfth century, are fully illustrated in the cathedrals in the stone carving of the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], the [[parapet]]s, and the tops of the [[buttress]]es, and in the woodwork of the [[Choir stall|stall]]s.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA2012"/&gt;

[[File:Cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris (France), Gargoyles in West facade (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Monstrous [[medieval]] beasts decorating the West facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]]]

There are birds of prey, wild boars, and feline forms on the towers of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]; birds covered with draperies, and elephants at [[Reims]]; enormous oxen on the towers of [[Laon]] placed there in memory of the service of those animals during the construction of the Cathedral. With the animals of the country, domestic or wild, those of remote parts of the earth, known by a few specimens, are also represented: the lion, the elephant, apes, etc.; legendary animals also, like the [[unicorn]], the [[basilisk]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|described by Pliny]]), the dragon, and the [[griffin]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA2012"/&gt; In classical times, the griffin was a keeper of light, attending [[Apollo]], and Christians retained the griffin's association as a guardian of the dead.&lt;ref name="MMA2012"/&gt; Imaginary creatures are also frequent, and the [[gargoyle]]s alone display a great variety. [[Viollet-le-Duc]] remarked that he did not know, in France, two gargoyles alike.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Viollet-le-Duc]], ''Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française du XI au XVI siècle'' (Paris, 1858)&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism which usually attaches to the various animals is derived for the most part from the bestiaries. Thus, for the lion, strength, vigilance, and courage; for the [[Siren (mythology)|siren]], voluptuousness; for the [[pelican]], charity. The four animals which symbolize the leading characteristics of each of the Four Evangelists become more and more an accessory used to characterize the figure of the Evangelists themselves from the fifth century onwards.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMA2012"/&gt;

[[File:Diego Velázquez - St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit (detail) - WGA24397.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Raven]] identifying [[St. Paul the Hermit]] in [[Diego Velázquez]]'s ''Saint Anthony the Great and Saint Paul the Anchorite'', c. 1634]]

===Animals used to identify saints===

In the same way many saints, when not characterized by the instruments of their martyrdom, are accompanied by animals which identify them; as, [[St. Roche]], with a dog; [[Hubertus|St. Hubert]], with a stag; [[St. Jerome]], with a lion; [[St. Peter]], with a cock; [[St. Paul the Hermit]], with a raven, etc. The Bible, also, gives some motives, as the [[ram of Isaac]], the [[golden calf]], the [[brazen serpent]].&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

==Renaissance==

[[File:Cat in Ghirlandaio's Last Supper fresco, Refectory, San Marco, Florence.jpg|thumb|left|Cat in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s [[c:Category:Last Supper by Ghirlandaio (San Marco)|Last Supper fresco]], [[San Marco, Florence]], 1486]]

With the fourteenth century, animals become less frequent in [[iconography]]. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries use them again, but copied more closely from life, usually of small size, and without any intention of symbolism. One finds now animals such as rats, snakes, rabbits, snails, and lizards.&lt;ref name=Catholic/&gt;

[[File:Detail Madonna del Cardellino.jpg|thumb|Detail of [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]] in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Madonna del cardellino]]'', 1506]]

[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Madonna del cardellino]]'' (Madonna of the Goldfinch) portrays [[John the Baptist]] holding a [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]] while [[Jesus|Christ]] reaches out his arms to touch it. The bird is associated by legend with the [[crucifixion]], the red spot on its head supposedly arising from a drop of Christ's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Raphael |last=Beck |first=James H. |chapter=The Madonna of the Goldfinch |pages=106–107 |year=1976 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |isbn=0-8109-0432-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

Some of the most important symbolic animals are described in the table.&lt;ref name=VAM&gt;{{cite web |title=Christian Symbolism: The Natural World |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/christian-symbolism-the-natural-world/ |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollinary Gilyarievich Goravsky''', also seen as '''Horawski''' (Belarusian: Апалінарый Гіляравіч Гараўскі, Russian: Аполлинарий Гиляриевич Горавский; 23 January 1833, Uborky, [[Minsk Governorate]] - 28 March 1900, Kirilovich, [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]]) was a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] painter.

== Biography ==
Apalinar (Apollinary) was born into an impoverished family of the Belarusian [[Polish landed gentry|landed gentry]]. His parents were Guilyar Frantsevich and Maryanna Yakauleuna Garausky. The family used the [[coat of arms]] "Korab" (since the 17th century) and traced its [[bloodline]] to the Belarusian [[Polish landed gentry|nobleman]] Grakala-Garausky (in the 19th century the first part of the surname Grakala fell into disuse). The artist's father Guilyar Garausky inherited the land (about 200 ha) from his father and grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;РГИА. ― Ф. 1343. ― Оп. 19. ― Д. 3065 ; РГВИА. ― Ф. 400. ― Оп. 12. ― Д. 18689 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; In the family, there were three daughters and the sons Ipalit (1828 ― after 1864), Apalinar (Apollinary) (1833―1900), Karl (1838 ― after 1869), Hektar (1843―1893), Guilyar (1847 ― after 1875). Karl and Hektar were professional servicemen, Ipalit, Apalinar and Guilyar ― artists.&lt;ref&gt;Апалінар Гараўскі = Аполлинарий Горавский = Apalinar Garausky. Минск : Беларусь, 2014. ― {{ISBN|978-985-01-1111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ГоравскийГоравский Вечер в Минской губернии 1870-е.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Evening in Minsk (1870s)]]
Apollinary, at ten, was sent to serve in the [[Brest-Litovsk]] Cadet Corps.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[http://www.kimpress.by/index.phtml?page=2&amp;DomainName=hbvmxuldokgq&amp;id=4919 Kultura], Biography and appreciation by Boris Krepak&lt;/ref&gt; Cadets studied general subjects of the classical school curriculum, such as languages, natural and social sciences. They were taught military disciplines, marching drill, riding, shooting, fencing, gymnastics, swimming, and also music and dance, drawing and painting. Apollinary had no inclination for military affairs, but liked drawing and painting. The architect [[Nicholas Benois]], who was visiting Goravsky's uncle (Chief of the Cadet Corps), took notice of Apollinary's works and later helped him enroll at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], where he studied with [[Maxim Vorobiev]] and [[Fyodor Bruni]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He graduated in 1854 with a gold medal. From 1855 to 1860 he travelled and painted throughout Europe, visiting Geneva, Paris and Rome and stopping in [[Düsseldorf]] to study with [[Andreas Achenbach]]. During this trip, he met [[Pavel Tretyakov]] and began a collaboration that would later be very beneficial to his career. On his return to Saint Petersburg, he was awarded the title of "Academician".&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

In 1869, the Academy gave him a stipend of 300 [[ruble]]s annually to "complete his education" and produce paintings of folk-life in Belarus and Ukraine, a commission which he pursued diligently, despite the cold weather and rheumatism in his right leg.&lt;ref&gt;''Гiсторыя беларускага мастацтва'' (History of Belarusian Art) 6 vols., 1989 pgs.209—216&lt;/ref&gt; For twenty years (1865—1885), he occasionally taught drawing at the "Society for the Encouragement of the Arts", although he spent most of his time in Belarus at his estate near Kirilovich.

Apollinary Goravsky died suddenly on March 28, 1900 at the Mariinsky Hospital in [[St. Petersburg]] at the age of 67. The death was reported in ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|Novoye Vremya]]'' (New Times) and ''[[Istorichesky Vestnik]]'' (Historical Herald) magazines. The artist was buried at [[Vyborg]] [[cemetery]].

His widow, Alexandra, remained without maintenance with daughters, Marya and Yulia, and started selling the artist's works in the 1900s.

The greater part of the works of Apollinary Goravsky are exhibited in the [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]].

In 2009, Belarus issued a stamp featuring his painting "Evening in Minsk".

'''''CIOPW''''' is a collection of artwork by [[E. E. Cummings]] published in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Kostelanetz, “E.E. Cummings’s Long-Forgotten Artist’s Book,” ''Hyperallergic'': https://hyperallergic.com/378792/e-e-cummingss-long-forgotten-artists-book/ &lt;/ref&gt;  The title is an [[acronym]] made from the initial letters of the five media Cummings used to produce the collection: [[charcoal]], [[ink]], [[Oil painting|oil]], [[pencil]], and [[watercolours]]. Images at http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/CIOPW/CIOPW.html.

''CIOPW'' contains 99 works, 27 of which are drawings and 72 of which are paintings. Since it is Cummings’ art and not his words that are on display, the title is also to be read as the ancient Greek word σιωπῶ, “I am silent,” with (i) a so-called lunate sigma, (ii) an omicron rather than an omega the first time (a combination sometimes found on Greek inscriptions), (iii) a “P” rather than a “Π” to keep the sound the same, and (iii) a “W” to represent “ω” visually.  The title should thus be pronounced “siôpô,” with the stress on the last syllable. Compare his other Greek titles EIMI = εἰμί, “I am”; and XAIPE = χαῖρε (pronounced "chaire," with a guttural ch), "greetings, be well."&lt;ref&gt;David Sider, “Art Without Words: Cummings’ CIOPW,” ''Spring'' 21-22 (2015 [2016]) 221-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ademollo-Teano.jpg|thumb|325px|The Handshake of [[Teano]]]]
'''Carlo Ademollo''' (9 October 1824, [[Florence]] - 15 July 1911, Florence) was an Italian painter, best known for his scenes from the [[Risorgimento]].

==Biography==
He was the grandson of the Milanese painter, [[Luigi Ademollo]]. In 1838, he enrolled at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]], where he studied with [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-ademollo_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Brief biography] @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt; He had his first exhibition in 1848, with scenes of contemporary customs. He came from a liberal family, many of whose members enlisted as volunteers in the [[First War of Italian Independence]] but, as a painter, he remained strictly traditional. He briefly took part in the "{{ill|Scuola di Staggia|it}}" (a group of landscape painters inspired by the [[Barbizon school]]) and frequented the [[Caffè Michelangiolo]], but never joined the [[Macchiaioli]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

Later, he moved away from landscapes and [[Genre art|genre]] scenes to depict episodes from the Risorgimento; including the breach of the [[Porta Pia]] during the [[Capture of Rome]], the "[[Teano#"Handshake of Teano"|Handshake of Teano]]", between [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], and the execution of [[Felice Orsini]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

During the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], he followed the army at his own expense and maintained an extensive correspondence with those involved, requesting details to help him create his paintings. He also participated in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], receiving the rank of [[Adjutant]] to the commander of the National Guard of Florence. Later, the King designated him the official painter of the Italian Army.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1869, he was named a corresponding professor at his alma mater, the Accademia.

Many of his letters and other personal items were donated to the "{{ill|Istituto per la storia del Risorgimento italiano|it}}" by his nephew Umberto. The Instituto also possesses one of Ademollo's last works; a posthumous portrait of {{ill|Adelaide Cairoli|it}}.

[[File:Castelseprio Simeon.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco of St Simeon from ''Santa Maria foris portas'' in Castelseprio.]]

'''Castelseprio''' or '''Castel Seprio''' was the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort in antiquity, and a significant [[Lombard League|Lombard]] town in the early Middle Ages, before being destroyed and abandoned in 1287. It is today preserved as an archaeological park in the modern [[Castelseprio (comune)|''comune'' of Castelseprio]], near the modern village of the same name.  It is in the north of Italy, in the [[Province of Varese]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Milan]].

The fame of Castelseprio lies in the Early Medieval [[fresco]]es contained in the small Church of ''Santa Maria foris portas''. &lt;!---name is explained below---&gt;These frescoes are of exceptional rarity and artistic significance. Hidden for centuries, the frescoes were only rediscovered in 1944. In 2011, the church - and the castrum with the [[Torba Tower]] - became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] as part of a group of seven inscribed as [[Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.)]].  In 2006, the Italian Ministry of Culture in a submission to [[UNESCO]], said: 
{{quote|text=The frescoes decorating the central apse of the church of Santa Maria foris portas constitute the finest early medieval pictorial cycle in terms of artistic quality, and are considered unique in early medieval European art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/333/ Unesco website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Santa Maria foris portas2.JPG|thumb|Church of Santa Maria foris portas]] 
Castelseprio originated as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort that commanded an important crossroad. During the early Middle Ages, the Lombards occupied the Roman fort, turning it into a fortified citadel or small town. At one point coins were minted there - a sign of its importance. The Church of ''Santa Maria foris portas'' ("foris portas" meaning "outside the gates" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) which contains the famous frescoes, lay just outside the walls of the citadel. The early dedication of the church to Mary is an assumption; the first documented mention of a church dedicated to Mary in Castelseprio (which is assumed to be this one) comes from the 13th century.

The whole citadel was completely destroyed by [[Ottone Visconti]], [[Archbishop of Milan]], after he captured it in 1287, to prevent it being used again by his rivals. Investigations into the church, which began in 1934, finally uncovered the famous Byzantinesque frescoes below later plaster in 1944.

The whole area is now an archaeological zone containing the remains of the walls and of the much larger three-aisled 5th-century Basilica of [[St John the Evangelist|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. There is also a [[baptistry]] of the 5th to 7th centuries dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]]. This has two fonts, perhaps for the use of different Rites, and is octagonal with a small apse to the east. A third Church of [[Paul of Tarsus|San Paolo]] has a central hexagonal plan and was built between the 6th and 12th centuries. There are some ruins left from the castle. Nearby is a large tower, once used as a [[convent]].

==Frescoes ==
[[File:Santa Maria foris portas7.JPG|thumb|The rear of the church, with the apse.]]
[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 002.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco of ''Presentation of Jesus in the Temple''.]]

When the Church of Santa Maria foris portas was investigated in 1944, it was found to contain, as well as later frescoes, a highly important and sophisticated cycle of fresco paintings showing very strong [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence. The dating of the frescoes and the origin of their painter or painters remain controversial, although the first half of the 9th century seems to be emerging as the most likely date. &lt;!---The speculative info has been put under Style---&gt;

===Subject===

The Byzantinesque frescoes are located around the curved wall of the apse, and the inward surface of the arch between the apse and the main body of the church. 
The condition of the frescoes is variable; some parts are well-preserved whilst others are missing completely, or barely visible. Much of the painted area has been pitted to provide a key for the subsequent plastering-over (see the lower area in the middle of the Presentation scene).

The subjects of the missing or fragmentary scenes are a matter of some scholarly controversy with some writers proposing that these scenes made up a cycle on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', and others one on the ''Life of Christ''; these views are described below.

The frescoes are in three registers, the middle register being interrupted by three arched windows. They represent a cycle of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity of Christ]] and may also have represented early aspects of the Life of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], or of Christ. The lowest register has a decorative [[frieze]] below which there are a few remains in the centre showing painted curtain railings and religious symbols. This register may not have contained figures. The upper and middle registers contain narrative paintings. The cycle may have been part of a larger scheme of decoration which once included the outer face of the arch and the other walls of the church. 
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, annunciazione e visitazione.jpg|thumb|[[Annunciation]] and incomplete [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]].]]

'''Upper register of narratives:'''
*1) Over the main arch, on the side inward to the apse, rather than in the body of the church, is a ''[[Hetoimasia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;From [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἑτοιμασία "preparation": an iconographic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[Christian art]] representing an empty throne.&lt;/ref&gt; or Throne of God with symbols on it, in a roundel, with an archangel on either side, flying in a "victory" pose.

Then, on the curved wall of the apse, reading left to right: 
*2) ''[[Annunciation]]'' and ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' - right side incomplete
* missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]]
*3) ''Trial by Bitter Water'' - left side incomplete
*4) Bust of ''[[Christ Pantocrator]]'', in a roundel over central window of the eastern apse. Below the window in the lowest register are traces of a painted [[exedra]] containing a [[Gospel]] book on a cushion.&lt;ref name="Castelseprio Website"&gt;[http://www.castelseprio.net Castelseprio Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
*5) ''Dream of [[Saint Joseph]]''
* missing roundel, which possibly contained the bust of [[John the Baptist]].
*6) ''Journey to [[Bethlehem]]'' - incomplete on the right

'''Middle Register''' 
On the curved wall, reading from right to left :
*7) ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]],'' and ''Annunciation to the shepherds''
*8) ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]]''
Fragmentary remains of two frescoes which may have been:
*9) ''The [[Flight into Egypt]].''&lt;ref name="Castelseprio Website"/&gt; or (in the Marian interpretation) ''The Birth of the Virgin'')
*10) ''The [[Massacre of the Innocents]]'' or (in the Marian interpretation) ''The Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple'')
On the two inner faces of the apsidal arch : 
*11) ''[[Adoration of the Magi]],'' on the inner face of the right side of the arch.
*12) on the inner face of the left side of the arch - remnants perhaps from ''The Dream of the Magi'' or (in the Marian interpretation) ''the Rejection of [[Joachim]]'s Offerings at the Temple'')

'''Chronological sequence'''
The alternative chronological sequences of the ten narrative scenes would run as follows:
*Nativity of Christ:         2,5,3,6,7,8,11,12,9,10
*Life of Mary:       12,9,10,2,5,3,6,7,8,11

In the Marian version the three missing scenes come at the start of the story, rather than the end.  Neither sequence follows a consistent chronological sequence on the wall. Joseph's (first) dream and the trial by bitter water come chronologically between the Annunciation and the Visitation.  The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple should, according to [[Leviticus]] have happened on the fortieth day after the birth.  The timing of the visit of Magi is not mentioned in the [[Gospel]]s, and apochryphal writings placed it between seven days and two years after the Nativity.  The Eastern church, and by the Gothic period the Western church also, at least in art, placed it very soon after the birth, so that the Magi, like the shepherds, are included in Nativity scenes themselves.  At this date, however, the Western church tended to place the arrival of the Magi later, though certainly before the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents.&lt;!---checking other western examples re sequence vs Presentation---&gt; Some departure from chronology to enable thematic or typological connections to be emphasised is a common feature of medieval picture cycles.

====The Marian interpretation====
Some scholars, notably P.D. Leveto,&lt;ref&gt;Leveto op cit.&lt;/ref&gt; interpret the cycle as being "Marian", that is, part of the Life of Mary, rather than specifically representing those scenes associated with the Nativity. Evidence for this interpretation is the presence of the rarely depicted scene of the "Trial by Bitter Water". With this interpretation, the three missing narrative scenes would have had a different content, and the sequence itself would be differently ordered, moving from the left-hand side of the arch to the first two scenes of the lower register, through the top register and then to lower right-hand scenes and finishing with the Magi scene on the opposite side of the arch. In this proposed arrangement, the two scenes of the Birth and Presentation at the Temple of Mary are visually balanced with each other, whilst the Presentation and the Trial by water above it are concerned with Mary's virginity. Also balanced are the two scenes of offerings on either side of the arch wall; in both cases the figures are placed to make their offerings away from the empty arched space, to keep the visual attention focused within the apse.

===Style===
[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|400px|Fresco of ''Joseph's Dream'' in the church of ''Santa Maria foris portas''.]]

It is thought by some scholars, including Leveto, that two different hands can be detected, but the origins of these artists are uncertain and subject to speculation.

The frescoes are sophisticated, expressive and confident. The artists adapt traditional compositional types to the particular site without strain or disproportion. Poses are natural and rhythmic, and the whole has "a great ardor and conviction, an intense response to the human meaning of the subject" (Schapiro). 
While some aspects of the frescoes, notably the [[iconography]], are clearly Byzantine, others may draw on the Christian art of [[Syria]] or [[Egypt]].

The frescoes also have significant aspects which relate most closely to the late antique art of Italy. Several of the buildings are successfully foreshortened, and the relationship between buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting. The painting is done with unusual freedom compared to most Byzantine work; it is this feature in particular which relates to much earlier works from the late antiquity such as paintings found in the [[catacombs of Rome]].

Some art historians see the style as coming from the tradition of [[Alexandria]], from which no other painting on a similar scale remains. John Beckwith is somewhat less enthusiastic than some art historians, describing the frescos as "wholly competent" and worthy of comparison with 7th century works in Rome&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed the "drapery folds ... a complex series of angular ridges emphasized by highlights ... make a decidedly metallic impression, and betray the copyist, who foreshadows in a disturbing way tenth-century mannerisms".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, natività.jpg|thumb|left|The Nativity scene]]
In 1950, soon after the frescoes were first discovered, a poll of the scholars who attended a conference in Castelseprio showed a rough split between dates in the 7th and 10th century, although the extreme range of dates that have been suggested stretches from the 6th to the 14th century - an almost unprecedented range in medieval art history.

Since that time, the range of possible dates has narrowed significantly. Radio-carbon dating of timber and thermoluminescent dating of roof tiles suggest that the church was built in the early to mid-ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;Leveto. n.2 - The average estimated date for the tiles was 828, and the timber gave 865 +/- 87, so between 778 and 952.&lt;/ref&gt;  While providing a reasonably sound date for the church structure, this can only be "terminus post quem" for the frescoes, which may have been added later. However, the rough finish on the interior stonework leads many scholars to believe that the frescoes were added as part of the original building programme.

A "terminus ante quem" was provided by the discovery of [[graffiti]] scratched into the fresco plaster recording a number of clerical appointments, the earliest of which is dated (by the name of the presiding [[Archbishop of Milan]]) to 948 at the latest. Many writers feel that a certain interval must have elapsed after the painting of the cycle before the clergy would have treated the paintings in this way.
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, cristo benedicente.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christ.]]

Many art historians have pointed to a relationship between the frescoes and two closely related [[manuscript]]s, namely the ''[[Joshua Roll]]'' ([[Vatican City|Vatican]] Library, Ms palatine gr. 431) and the ''[[Paris Psalter]]'' ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] Ms Grec. 139) [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paris_psalter]. However, the dating of both manuscripts is likewise controversial. The art historians [[Kurt Weitzmann]] and [[Meyer Schapiro]] agreed that the artistic quality of the frescoes is superior to that of either manuscript.

Kurt Weitzmann preferred a date shortly before 945, and postulated a connection with a marriage between a Lombard princess and [[Romanos II|a Byzantine prince]], which took place in 944. He favoured as the artist an unknown [[Constantinople|Constantinopolitan]] artist, trained in the same workshop as the artists of the two manuscripts, on a visit in connection with the marriage. Schapiro preferred a date between the 7th and 9th centuries, in 1957 settling on the 8th century.

Most recent writers, relying on the analysis of the timber and roof tiles mentioned above, prefer the first half of the 9th century. Some writers believe the work may have been done by Greek refugees long settled in Italy, or by Italians trained by such artists. Others believe that artists fresh from the Byzantine world were responsible.

===Aspects of the works===
[[File:Maestro di castelseprio, andata a betlemme.jpg|thumb|The ''Journey to Bethlehem'', a scene that in most cycles had already turned into the [[Flight to Egypt]].]] 
Almost every aspect of the frescoes, from the clothing to the treatment of the ''nimbus'' or [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around the infant Christ, has been analysed and compared to other works in great detail. Some examples are:

* The inscriptions naming various figures are in [[Latin]], and in Roman script, but the midwife at the Nativity is named as "EMEA", the "E" ("H" in the [[Greek alphabet]]) being a form of the Greek for "the". In the Byzantine period it is common to find Greek inscriptions naming figures in paintings which include the definite article. The Greek form of the inscription would be: "H MAIA".
* The treatment of the architectural elements within the paintings has been compared to Hellenizing work produced for [[Islam|Moslem]] patrons in the 8th century, at the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] in [[Damascus]] and elsewhere.
* The legend of the ''doubting midwife'', whose withered arm is miraculously cured, shown in the Nativity scene, probably appears only in art from the West during this period.
* The ''Trial by bitter water'' is otherwise extremely rare in Western iconography, and this is one of the latest of the few Byzantine depictions.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 56 &amp; figs, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}. Schapiro mentions also 10th-century frescoes in Cappadocia. Schiller describes this scene as "unknown in Western iconography" (p57), but there is a miniature of it in a French 13th century ''Life of the Virgin'' in St Petersberg (Fr.Fv.XIV.9 F8r), illustrated in T. Voronova and A Sterligov, ''Western European Illuminated Manuscripts'' (in the St Petersberg Public Library), 2003, Sirocco, London&lt;/ref&gt; The legend comes from the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of James|Protoevangelium of James]]'' and occurs, in the fully developed story, after the Dream of Joseph, in which an angel reassures Joseph who is disturbed to discover Mary's pregnancy, since he knows he has not slept with her. In the legend, others also notice the pregnancy and to dispel gossip and accusations, the priests of the Temple (where Mary had formerly been a temple maid) make the couple undergo the trial of drinking "bitter water" — their reaction to which will prove or disprove their innocence.  Naturally they pass. The idea of the trial is clearly based on ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 5, 11 ff''.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller op. cit p57&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was part of some Western [[medieval theatre|medieval religious dramas]], in which the "detractors" then drank the water, with horrible results. An example is the ''[[N-Town Plays|N-town Pageant series]]'' manuscript in the British Library, London (BL MS [[Cotton Vespasian]] D.8), which is mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/trial.html Modernised version of the text of the scene from the ''N-town Pageant series''] in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8). Mid-15th century from the East Midlands of England. See also Introduction page on the site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comprachicos''' (also '''Comprapequeños''' and '''Cheylas''') is a compound [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[neologism]] meaning "child-buyers", which was coined by [[Victor Hugo]] in his novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal

The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children's growth by [[physical restraint]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzling]] their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and malforming their bones.&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{cite book

==Historical references==
[[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' is the story of a young aristocrat kidnapped and disfigured by his captors to display a permanent malicious grin. At the opening of the book, Hugo provides a description of the Comprachicos:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and wonderful. They could touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have recognized it. Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face. Children destined for tumblers had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner; thus gymnasts were made. Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child; they also took away his memory. At least, they took away all they could of it; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected. Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical and which suppressed all pain.&lt;ref name="Hugo" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to research by John Boynton Kaiser in the Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, "Victor
Hugo has given us a pretty faithful picture of many characteristic details of social England of the 17th century; but the word Comprachicos is used to describe a people whose characteristics are an unhistorical conglomeration of much that was once actual but then obsolete in the history of human society."&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; Much that seems unimaginable today may have authentic roots in common practices of the seventeenth century.

One of the common creations of the Comprachicos was supposed to be artificial dwarfs, formed "by anointing babies' spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice" and using drugs such as "dwarf elder, [[knotgrass]], and daisy juice". The conception was known to [[Shakespeare]], as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Get you gone, dwarf;&lt;br&gt;You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other means of creating this result were conjectured to include physical stunting by breaking or dislocating bones, and forcible constraint, whereby growth was inhibited for a long enough period to create permanent deformation. Because of the demand for dwarfs and other novelties in the courts of kings at this time, this could have been a profitable occupation.

==Modern references==

The term ''comprachico'' is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}, but similar stories do exist in the English speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a [[Japan]]ese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in [[Europe]]; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (November 12, 2006). [http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/shanghai.asp "The Shanghai'd Bride"]. Snopes.com. Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comprachico" has been adopted as a pejorative term used for individuals and entities who manipulate the minds and attitudes of children in a way that will permanently distort their beliefs or worldview. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] referred to educators of the time as "the Comprachicos of the mind" in her article "The Comprachicos". Her criticism was targeted especially toward [[Educational progressivism|educational progressivists]], but also grade-school and high-school educators who, in her view, used psychologically harmful methods of education.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn: "The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution", pp. 41–95. Signet/NAL/Penguin, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr005=vqt6kzx6s2.app7a&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6151&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1069 Ayn Rand and her thoughts on Rational Education] Michael S. Berliner, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 album ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]'' by [[Australia]]n [[Drum and Bass]] band [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], one of the songs was named "Comprachicos", where the lyrics had references to manipulation and restraint.

The 2011 DC comic Batman and Robin #26 contained a villain whose father disfigured him after reading about the "Comprachicos" in Hugo's novel.

[[James Ellroy]] refers to them and Victor Hugo's novel in ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'' which forms a major motivation for the murder of Elizabeth Short.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5222">'''Computer-aided mural''' ('''CAM''')  is the use of [[computer]] technology for designing mural art and wall decoration resulting in the [[frescography]] procedure, which was invented in 1998 by German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent-de.com/20000203/DE19829627C1.html Patent information for mural-reproduction technique]&lt;/ref&gt; CAM may be used to design completely individual illusionary or decorative mural art. It is especially useful for artists who re-use certain images in each project, but also for people who cannot draw or paint at all.
[[Image:CAM software screenshots.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Procedure for a CAM design (screenshots):
1.Step: Cut out motiv. 2.Step: Convert into smaller sizes for composition. 3.Store into database and define properties. 4.create CAM design]]

== Properties of CAM ==
When starting a new project CAM software requests a user to fill in measurements, these will usually be of the wall which the frescography is later mounted to. 
Once the project has been created the user may choose from a library of images which are categorized into themes and motives.
The library will either be filled with content by the user himself, or the user can purchase a CAM software which is already filled by the manufacturer, the Dreamworlds Design Studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/Dreamworlds-Design-Studio/3000-18496_4-10907042.html?tag=mncol Dreamworlds Design Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;
The user creates designs by placing the motifs on the workspace. By giving the motifs layer attributes, it is possible to put image elements such as skies or oceans in the background and a beach or vegetation in the foreground. With additional options such as re-sizing and [[cropping]] individual motifs, a design gains depth and realistic proportions.

To avoid long waiting times when selecting new motifs CAM software uses low-[[Image resolution|resolution]] preview images. These are often only a hundredth of the original size, yet still large enough on a [[computer screen]]. After a design is completed it is converted into a PSD where each motif is automatically placed into its own layer to allow further changes and editing to be made with [[Adobe Systems]]'s [[Photoshop]].

== History and development ==
In the past, standard image editing software such as [[Photoshop]] or [[Illustrator]] were used to digitally create wall decoration such as [[Theatrical scenery|theatre backdrops]] or [[billboard]]s. The market for this type of art was scarce due to computers being expensive, and not being able to cope with the high resolution image files.
Only recent advances in computer and hardware technology allow artists to scan and print their work in very high and detailed quality. 

The last hurdle for artists to overcome was the large size a high-resolution image would produce. Even though there are no more problems cutting out individual images- to actually assemble several large images to create a design is still a challenge.
That is why CAM software not only works as design software, but is also a data management tool. In the front-office of the software the user will be working with low resolution files ([[GIF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] to keep transparency). Once a design is finished it is rendered or converted back into a [[Adobe Photoshop#File format|PSD]] file using the images maximum resolution and converting their color-coding from [[RGB]] to [[CMYK]].

== Computer hardware and operating systems ==
Today most Computer-Aided Mural software runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] based [[Personal Computer|PCs]]. Recent development in [[Emulator]] technologies and Apple's switch to [[Intel]] based hardware provide the option of running CAM software on Apple computers.
Because CAM software used low-resolution preview images while designing, there is no need for powerful computers. However developers recommend [[Intel Core 2 Duo]] technology and 2GB [[Random access memory|RAM]] or more.

==Printing and material==
[[Image:Pool with CAM designed murals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pool with a CAM designed wall mural printed with a vutek UV printer on synthetic canvas.]]A finished design is usually produced on Canvas, but depending on the printer a large variety of material may be used. With [[Ultraviolet|UV]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewpa.org/4.0.html?&amp;L=1  UV Drying Printing technologie (last paragraph)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[flatbed printer]]s also tiles, glass and other nonflexible material can be used as support. Because of the mostly large size of the files the images are usually given in with 72 [[Dots per inch|DPI]] but through [[interpolation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.surewest.net/frcn/Interpolation.html What is Interpolation]&lt;/ref&gt; methods appear optically like a higher resolution print. 

The lifetime of the print depends on the material; however modern printers offer an anti-abrasion layer to coat the material while being printed. Additionally, invisible UV and protective coating may be applied manually to increase the products lifetime. Manufacturers state that a Frescography will last over 10 years without noticeable change.

The '''''Deposition from the Cross''''' is a painting of the [[Deposition of Christ]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] Renaissance master [[Fra Angelico]], executed between 1432 and 1434. It is now housed in the National Museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].

[[Giorgio Vasari]] defined it to have been “painted by a saint or an angel”.

Angelico intervened to complete this altarpiece when it had been already begun by [[Lorenzo Monaco]] for the [[Strozzi Chapel]] in the Florentine church of [[Santa Trinita]]. It portrays Christ supported by several people, with [[Mary Magdalene]] keeping his feet, as a symbol of human repention. A figure on the right, with a red hat, is showing the cross' nails and the horns crown, symbols of passion and sacrifice.

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], wearing a dark dress, is shown  in the traditional gesture of keeping hands joined.

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006). [http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm The Big Picture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073242/http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] (originally called introduction), [[rising action]] (rise), [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], [[falling action]] (return or fall), and [[dénouement]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[wikt:resolution|resolution]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[revelation]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="fall4"&gt;University of Illinois: Department of English (2006). [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm Freytag’s Triangle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716152819/http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm |date=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[fountain]] in the [[Piazza Colonna]]''' is a fountain in  [[Rome]], [[Italy]],  designed by the architect [[Giacomo Della Porta]] and constructed by the [[Fiesole]] sculptor Rocco Rossi between 1575 and 1577.&lt;ref&gt;Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, pg. 17 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fountain was one of a group of sixteen fountains built by Della Porta following the reconstruction of the [[Acqua Vergine]] aqueduct, a project begun by [[Pope Pius IV]] in 1561 and finished by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570.   The fountain itself was built under [[Pope Gregory XIII]], best known for creating the [[Gregorian calendar]].  Like the other Roman fountains of its time, it was built to provide clean drinking water to the Roman residents, who before then had to drink the polluted water of the [[Tiber River]].   Also like the other fountains of its time, it operated purely by gravity;  the source of the water was higher the fountain itself, causing the water to spout into the air.   

The water for the fountain first arrived at the old Trevi Fountain, then went two reservoirs at the foot of the butte of San Sebastiancello, then through a series of the channels to the corner of via Condotti and the via del Corso,  to [[Piazza Venezia]], to the foot of the column of [[Marcus Aurelius]].  The source of the water for the fountain of Piazza Colonna was only 67 feet above sea level;  like the [[Trevi Fountain]], the [[Fontana della Barcaccia]], and the fountains of [[Piazza Navona]], all connected to the Acqua Vergine, the fountain of Piazza Colonna was unable to jet water high into the air.&lt;ref&gt;See Katherine Wentworth Rinne,  ''The Fall and Rise of the Waters of Rome'', in Marilyn Symmes,  ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original project of Della Porta was to place an antique Roman statue of a sea god, called Marforio, in  the fountain, against a background of a rocky grotto, behind which the column of Marcus Aurelius would be seen.&lt;ref&gt;See Tazartes, pg. 58. The original design by Della Porta, dated 1574, was found in the papers of Pole Alexander VII.  See D'Onofrio, pg. 114, figure 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The final fountain was simpler:  the octagonal basin of the fountain was made of pink marble from the island of [[Chios]] in [[Greece]], the same marble that Della Porta used for frame of the doorway of [[St. Peter's Basilica]].  Della Porta also designed the sixteen carved lion heads around the basin.   A circular stone vasque was placed on a pedestal in the center, and water poured from this vasque into the basin.&lt;ref&gt;Tazartes, pg. 58&lt;/ref&gt;     

The fountain was slightly restored by [[Bernini]] during the pontificate of [[Pope Alexander VII]].   In 1702 Pope Clement XI placed his own coat of arms, a star with eight points, on top of the original vasque in the center, but this was removed after his death.  

In 1830 the architect Alessandro Stocchi removed the original central vasque and replaced it with the current vasque, made of white marble.  He also added two groups of sculptures of dolphins, their tails wrapped around seashells, spouting water from their mouths, at either end of the basin.

'''''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels''''' is a 1653 painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now held in the collection of [[Museo Lázaro Galdiano]] in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://database.flg.es/ficha.asp?ID=8447 La visita del Archiduque Leopoldo Guillermo a su gabinete, acompañado de David Teniers el joven] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector with friends admiring a set of paintings. The artist himself holds his hat in his hand and is listening to his patron as the archduke gestures with his cane towards some recent acquisitions. The paintings are arranged in rows on the walls of an L-shaped room, with the men standing in front of a doorway with the sculpted portrait of the archduke. Another set of paintings are positioned in the foreground leaning against chairs for inspection.

This painting is dated 1653 and was painted after earlier, larger versions that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; The most impressive of these gallery paintings was the [[The Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Painting Gallery in Brussels|large version on copper]] in the [[Museo del Prado]] with a different selection of paintings. That was produced as a gift from the archduke to  [[Philip IV of Spain]].

==Paintings depicted==
{{main|Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels (Rothschild)}}
Many of the recognizable paintings in the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, are still in the Viennese collection. This copy was probably produced as a gift in tandem with a similar version formerly in the [[Rothschild]] collection.

'''Gendün Chöphel''' ({{Bo|t=དགེ་འདུན་ཆོས་འཕེལ།|w=dge 'dun chos 'phel}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historychina.net/manager/info/inner.jsp?sid=1&amp;cid=34&amp;infoid=25285 西藏革命党考实]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2017}} (1903–1951) was a Tibetan scholar, thinker, writer, and artist. He was born in 1903 in Shompongshe, Rebkong, Amdo. He was a creative and controversial figure and he is considered by many to have been one of the most important Tibetan intellectuals of the twentieth century.

Gendün Chöphel was a friend of [[Rahul Sankrityayan]]. His life was the inspiration for Luc Schaedler's film ''The Angry Monk: Reflections on Tibet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angrymonk.ch/ The Angry Monk: Reflections on Tibet]&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his collection of essays called ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chophel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopez Jr.|first=Donald S.|title=The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Choephel|year=2006|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-49316-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Grains of Gold: Tales of a Cosmopolitan Pilgrimage'', written during his time in India and Sri Lanka in between 1934 and 1946. These essays were critical of modern [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], and [[British Empire|British imperialism]]. While condemning places and events like the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]] and the [[Goa Inquisition]], he praised certain British colonial practices like the abolition of [[Sati (practice)|sati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Tibetan Tradition|editor1-first=Kurtis R|editor1-last=Schaeffer|editor2-first=Matthew T|editor2-last=Kapstein|editor3-first=Gray|editor3-last=Tuttle|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|chapter=Tibetans Addressing Modern Political Issues|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''hilya''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] حلية (plural: ''ḥilan'', ''ḥulan''), {{lang-tr|hilye}} (plural: ''hilyeler'')  denotes both a visual form in [[Ottoman art]] and a religious genre of [[Turkish literature#Ottoman literature|Ottoman Turkish literature]], each dealing with the [[physical description of Muhammad]]. Hilya literally means "ornament".

They originate with the discipline of  ''shama'il'', the study of Muhammad's appearance and character, based on [[hadith]] accounts, most notably [[Tirmidhi]]'s ''al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah'' ("The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad").

In Ottoman-era [[folk Islam]], there was a belief that reading and possessing Muhammad's description protects the person from trouble in this world and the next, it became customary to carry such descriptions,  rendered in fine [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated]], as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="Bakker2009"&gt;{{cite book |title= The challenge of the silver screen: an analysis of the cinematic portraits of Jesus, Rama, Buddha and Muhammad |last= Bakker |first= Freek L.|authorlink= |year= 2009 |publisher= BRILL |location= |isbn= 978-90-04-16861-9 |page= 209 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4KNSp-uEO18C&amp;pg=PA209 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt; In 17th-century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkey]], ''hilyes'' developed into an art form with a standard layout, often framed and used as a wall decoration.
[[File:Hilye Yesarizade Mustafa Izzet Efendi.JPG|thumb|19th-century hilye on gilded and framed panel.]]

Later ''hilyes'' were also written for the [[Rashidun|first four Caliphs]], the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], Muhammad's grandchildren ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]]) and Islamic saints ([[wali]]s).

== Origins in hadith ==
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah}}
''Hilye'', both as the literary genre and as the graphic art form, originates from ''shama'il'', the study of Muhammad's appearance and character. The best source on this subject is considered to be Imam [[Tirmidhi]]'s ''al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah'' ("The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad"). The acceptance and influence of this work has led to the use of the term ''"shama'il"'' (appearance) to mean Muhammad's fine morals and unique physical beauty. As they contained hadiths describing Muhammad's spirit and physique, ''shama-il'' have been the source of ''hilye''. The best known and accepted of these hadith are attributed to his son-in-law and cousin [[Ali]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge companion to Muhammad |last= Brockopp |first= Jonathan E. |authorlink= |year= 2010 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-521-71372-6 |page= 130 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o58K2t344YQC&amp;pg=PA130 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The sources of ''hilye'' have been the six main hadith books along with other hadith sources, attributed to people such as [[Aisha]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas]], [[Abu Hurairah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. While ''shama'il'' lists the physical and spiritual characteristics of Muhammad in detail, in ''hilye'' these are written about in a literary style.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Cumhuriyet Üniversitesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | author= Erdoğan, M. | title= Hâkim Mehmed Efendi'nin Manzum Hilyesi |  volume=  11 |pages= 317–357| year=  2007| url= http://eskidergi.cumhuriyet.edu.tr/makale/1514.pdf | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other descriptive ''Shama'il'' text are the ''Dala'il al-Nubuwwah'' of [[Al-Bayhaqi]], ''Tarih-i Isfahan'' of Abu Naeem Isfahani, ''Al-Wafa bi Fadha'il al-Mustafa'' of [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi]]  and ''Al-Shifa'' of [[Qadi Ayyad]] are the main shemaa-il and hilya books.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

==Literary genre==
Although many ''hilyes'' exist in Turkish literature, Persian literature does not have many examples of the ''shama'il'' and ''hilye'' genre. Abu Naeem Isfahani wrote a work titled ''Hilyetü'l-Evliya'', but it is not about Muhammad. For this reason, the ''hilye'' is considered one of Turkey's national literary genres.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; Turkish literature has also some early works that may have inspired the appearance of the ''hilye'' as a literary genre. The ''Vesiletü'n-necat'' of [[Süleyman Çelebi (poet)|Süleyman Çelebi]] (1351-1422 [[:fr:Suleyman Çelebi (de Bursa)]]), and the ''Muhammeddiye'' of [[Yazıcıoğlu Mehmed]], referred to Muhammad's characteristics.&lt;ref name="Yazar"&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Journal of Turkish Studies | author= Yazar, S. | title= Seyyid Şerîfî Mehmed Efendi ve Hilyesi (Seyyid Sherîfî Efendi and His Hilye) | volume= 2 | pages= 1026–1044 | year= 2007 | url= http://www.egirdir.net/SeyyidMehmed.pdf | language= Turkish | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413170136/http://www.egirdir.net/SeyyidMehmed.pdf | archivedate= 2014-04-13 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 255-verse long ''Risale-i Resul'' about the attributes of Muhammad, written by a writer with the penname of Şerifi, was presented to [[Shahzade Bayezid]], one of the sons of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], at an unknown date that was presumably before the Shahzade's death in 1562.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; This is believed to be the earliest ''hilye'' in verse form in Turkish literature.&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; However, the ''Hilye-i Şerif'' by [[Mehmet Hakani]] (d. 1606–07) is considered the finest example of the genre (see section below).&lt;ref name=Gruber132&gt;{{cite book |title= The Islamic manuscript tradition: ten centuries of book arts in Indiana University collections |last= Gruber |first= Christiane J. |authorlink= |year= 2010 |publisher= Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-253-35377-1 |pages=131–133 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lIY0oAd6Y40C&amp;pg=PA132}}

Although the ''hilye'' tradition started with descriptions of Muhammad, later ''hilyes'' were written about the [[Rashidun|first four Caliphs]], the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], Muhammad's grandchildren ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]]) and Islamic saints ([[walis]]) such as [[Rumi|Mevlana]].&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; The second most important ''hilye'', after Hakani's, is considered to be Cevri İbrahim Çelebi's ''hilye'', ''Hilye-i Çihar-Yar-ı Güzin'' (1630), about the physical appearance of the first four caliphs.&lt;ref name="Erkal1999"&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Atatürk Üniversitesi Türkiyat Araştırmaları Enstitüsü Dergisi | issue= 12 | pages= 111–131  | year= 1999| title=  Türk Edebiyatında Hilye ve Cevri'nin "Hilye-i Çâr Yâr-ı Güzin"i | author=Erkal, A. | url= http://e-dergi.atauni.edu.tr/index.php/taed/article/viewFile/1784/1783  | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important ''hilye'' writer is Nesati Ahmed Dede (d. 1674), whose 184-verse long poem is about the physical characteristics of [[Prophets in Islam|14 prophets]] and [[Adam]].&lt;ref name="Erkal1999"/&gt; Other notable ''hilyes'' are Dursunzâde Bakayi's ''Hilye'tûl-Enbiya ve Çeyar-ı Güzîn'' (hilye of the prophet and his four caliphs), Nahifi's (d. 1738) prose ''hilye'' ''Nüzhet-ûl-Ahyar fi Tercüment-iş-Şemîl-i'' and Arif Süleyman Bey's (1761) ''Nazire-î Hakânî''.&lt;ref name="velioglu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hilye-i Şerif |author=Velioğlu, A.K. |work=Klasik Türk Sanatları Vakfı |accessdate=2012-01-18 |url=http://www.klasikturksanatlarivakfi.com/indexalt.php?sayfa=fotograf&amp;fotokateid=40 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110205152/http://www.klasikturksanatlarivakfi.com/indexalt.php?sayfa=fotograf&amp;fotokateid=40 |archivedate=2010-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hilyes'' can be written as standalone prose or poems (often in the [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]] form). They can also be part of two other forms of Turkish Islamic literature, a Mevlid (account of Muhammad's life) or a ''Mir'aj-name'' (accounts of Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]).&lt;ref name="ispirli"/&gt;

==Art form==
[[File:PQ Khalili hilye mss 0759.JPG|thumb|right|A ''hilye'' (1712) meant to be folded and carried on one's person (the crease lines are visible). The two crescents above and below the large circle in the middle contain the description of Muhammad. The central circle describes the protective powers of the ''hilye''. The protective hand of [[Fatimah]] is also drawn on the lower crescent, as another sign against evil. The circle and the edges of the sheet are bordered with [[Koran]]ic verses. ]]
While writers developed ''hilye'' as a literary genre, calligraphers and illuminators developed it into a decorative art form. Because of their supposed protective effect, a practice developed in Ottoman Turkey of the 17th century of carrying Muhammad's description on one's person.&lt;ref name="baycol"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hilye-i Şerifler ve Medeniyetimizdeki Yeri | author= Bayçöl, H.| year= 2007 | journal= Yağmur | issue= 37| volume= | pages= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71303374/Hat-Sanat%C4%B1nda-Hilye-i-%C5%9Eerif-U%C4%9Fur-DERMAN | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, because of the belief that a house with a ''hilye'' will not see poverty, trouble, fear or the devil,&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; such texts came to be displayed prominently in a house. The term of '''hilye''' was used for the art form for presenting these texts.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt; Thus, the ''hilye'', as a vehicle for Muhammad's presence after his death, was believed to have a [[talisman]]ic effect, capable of protecting a house, a child, a traveller, or a person in difficulty.&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt; In addition, the purpose of the ''hilye'' is to help visualize Muhammad as a mediator between the sacred and human worlds, to connect with him by using the viewing of the ''hilye'' as an opportunity to send a traditional blessing upon him, and to establish an intimacy with him.&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zakariya/&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2009"/&gt;

The pocket ''hilyes'' were written on a piece of paper, small enough to fit in a breast pocket after being folded in three. The folding lines were reinforced with cloth or leather. Other pocket ''hilyes'' were made of wood.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; ''Hilyes'' to be displayed on a wall were prepared on paper mounted on wooden panels, although in the 19th century, thick paper sheets became another medium.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; The top part of ''hilyes'' that were laid on wooded panels were carved and cut out in the form of a crown. The crown  part would be richly illuminated and miniatures of Medina, the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|tomb of Muhammad]] or the [[Kabaa]] would be placed there, together or separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Hilye-i Şerife| author= Faruk Taşkale| url= http://www.faruktaskale.com/hilye-i-serife-the-charactrestics-of-the-prophet-muhammed | accessdate= 2012-01-20 | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottoman Turks have commissioned scribes to write ''hilyes'' in fine calligraphy and had them decorated with illuminators. Serving as a textual portraits of the prophets, ''hilye'' panels have decorated homes for centuries. These calligraphic panels were often framed and came to be used as wall decorations in houses, [[mosque]]s and shrines, fulfilling an equivalent role to that played by images of Jesus in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref name="Safi2009"&gt;{{cite book |title= Memories of Muhammad: why the Prophet matters |last=Safi |first= Omid |authorlink= Omid Safi |year= 2009 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= |isbn= 978-0-06-123134-6  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs2oDbagvfIC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book |title= Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives |last= Peters |first= F.

The first recorded instance of Hilye-i Sherif panels is generally believed to have been prepared by the notable scribe [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698).&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; He was one of earliest scribes known to make such works, although it has been suggested that another famous scribe, [[Ahmed Karahisarî]] (1468–1556), may have created one ''hilye'' panel about a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Abdulkadiroğlu, A.| title=İlk Hilye Hattatı Ahmed Karahisari mi?

Its text was written in very small ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' script and has dimensions of 22x14 cm. It consisted of a description of Mohammad in Arabic, and below that its Turkish translation, written in diagonal, to create a triangular block of text.&lt;ref name="derman"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Hat Sanatında Hilye-i Şerif | author= Derman, M.U.| year= 2000 | journal= Diyanet: İlmî Dergi | volume= | pages= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71303374/Hat-Sanat%C4%B1nda-Hilye-i-%C5%9Eerif-U%C4%9Fur-DERMAN | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic feature of the texts shown at the centre of ''hilyes'' is their praise for the beauty of Muhammad's physical appearance and character.&lt;ref name="Safi2009"/&gt;{{rp|273–274}} While containing a verbal description of what Muhammad looked like, a ''hilye'' leaves picturing Muhammad's appearance to the reader's imagination, in line with the [[aniconism in Islam|mainly aniconic nature of Islamic art]].&lt;ref name="Peters2010" /&gt;

===Standard layout===
The standard layout for the Ottoman ''hilye'' panel is generally attributed to [[Hâfiz Osman]]. This layout is generally considered to be the best and has come to be the classical form.&lt;ref name="velioglu"/&gt; It contains the following elements:&lt;ref name=Gruber132/&gt;
[[File:Hilye-i Serif 6.jpg|thumb|left|Hilye by [[Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi]] (1801–1876)]]
*The ''baş makam'' ("head station"), a top panel containing a ''[[bismallah]]'' or blessing&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"&gt;{{cite book |title= Letters in gold: Ottoman calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı collection, Istanbul |last= Derman |first= M.

*The ''göbek'' ("belly"), a round shape containing the first part of the main text in ''naskh'' script.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt; It often contains the description of Muhammad by [[Ali]] (according to [[Tirmidhi]]), with minor variations&lt;ref name="Schick"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Shick, I.C. | year= 2008 | title=The Iconicity of Islamic Calligraphy in Turkey | journal= RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics | issue=53/54 | pages= 211–224 | jstor= 25608818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(see quote in the [[#Origins|Origins]] section above).
*The ''hilâl'' ("[[crescent]]"), an optional section with no text, which is often [[gilding|gilded]].  A crescent encircling the ''göbek'', with its thick middle part at the bottom.  Together, the ''göbek'' and ''hilal'' also evoke the image of the sun and the moon.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''kösheler'' ("corners"), usually four rounded compartments surrounding the ''göbek'', typically containing the names of the four ''[[Rashidun]]'' or "rightly-guided" [[Caliph]]s according to [[Sunnis]], or in some cases other titles of Muhammad, names of his companions, or some of the names of [[Allah]].&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''ayet'' or ''kuşak'' ("verse" or "belt") section below the ''göbek'' and crescent, containing a verse from the [[Quran]], usually {{cite quran|21|107|b=n|style=ref}} ("And We [God] did not send you  [Muhammad] except to be a mercy to the universe"), or sometimes {{cite quran|68|4|b=n|style=ref}} ("Truly, you [Muhammad] are of a tremendous nature") or {{cite quran|48|28–29|b=n|style=ref}} ("And God is significant witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God").&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''etek'' ("skirt" or lower part) containing the conclusion of the text begun in the ''göbek'', a short prayer, and the signature of the artist. If the main text fits completely in the ''göbek'', the ''etek'' may be absent.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;
*The ''koltuklar'' ("empty spaces"), two alleys or side panels on either side of the ''etek'' that typically contain ornamentation – sometimes illuminated – but no text, although occasionally the names of some of the ten companions of Muhammad are found there.&lt;ref name="DermanN.Y.)1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;
*The ''iç'' and ''dış pervaz'' ("inner and outer frame"), an ornamental border in correct proportion to the text.&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite book |title= The type of calligraphy: Writing, print, and technologies of the Arabic alphabet |last= Osborn |first= J.

The remainder of the space is taken up with decorative [[Ottoman illumination]], of the type usual for the period, often with a border framing the whole in a contrasting design to the main central field that is the background of the text sections. The "verse" and "corners" normally use a larger ''[[thuluth]]'' script, while the "head" section with the ''bismallah'' is written in ''[[muhaqqaq]]''.&lt;ref name=Ali8&gt;

The names in Turkish of the central structural elements of the ''hilye'' are, from top to bottom, ''başmakam'' (head station), ''göbek'' (belly), ''kuşak'' (belt) and ''etek'' (skirt). This [[anthropomorphic]] naming makes it clear that the ''hilye'' represents a human body, whose purpose is "to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct".&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{cite book| author=Gruber, Christiane J. | title= The Islamic manuscript tradition: ten centuries of book arts in Indiana University collections | year= 2010 |  publisher= Indiana University Press | page= | isbn= 978-0-253-35377-1| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lIY0oAd6Y40C&amp;pg=PA132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref name="Schick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt; that Hafiz Osman's ''hilye'' design might have been inspired by the celebrated [[#Hilye-i Şerif|Hilye-i Şerif]], which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said "... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... ". If so, a ''hilye'' might have been meant to be ''not read'' but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text.&lt;ref name="Schick" /&gt;

The standard Hilye-i Şerif composition has been followed by calligraphers since its creation in the late 17th century. Some examples from the 19th century and two made by Hafiz Osman can be seen below.

==Popularity of the graphic form==
[[File:Hilye with side panels 1718.jpg|thumb|left|A ''hilye'' from 1718, similar to a Christian [[triptych]]. The middle panel is topped with a crown carving. The side panes list the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of Allah]].]]
There are several reasons given for the popularity of graphic ''hilyes''.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt;  Islam prohibits the depiction of graphic representations of people that may lead to idols. For this reason, Islamic art developed in the forms of calligraphy, miniatures and other non-figurative arts. In miniatures, Muhammad's face was either veiled or blanked. Because of the prohibition on drawing the face of Muhammad, the need to represent Muhammad was satisfied by writing his name and characteristics.

Many authors have commented that another reason is the affection that Muslims feel for Muhammad, which leads them to read about his physical and moral beauty.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt; The (apocryphal) hadith that those who memorize his ''hilye'' and keep it close to their heart will see Muhammad in their dreams would have been another reason. Muslim people's love for Muhammad is considered to be one of the reasons for the display of ''hilye'' panels at a prominent place in their homes (see [[#Graphic art form section|Graphic art form section]] below).

Hakani has said in his poem that a house with a ''hilye'' will be protected from trouble. Another motivation would have been the hadith given by Hakani in the Hilye-i Şerif, which states that those who read and memorize Muhammad's ''hilye'' will attain great rewards in this and the other world, will see Muhammad in their dreams, will be protected from many disasters, and will receive Muhammad's esteem.

In the "sebeb-i te'lîf" ve "hâtime" section of the ''hilye'', the writer gives the reasons to write the ''hilye''. Hakani wrote that his reason was to be worthy of Muhammad's holy intercession (''shefaat'') on doomsday and to receive a prayer from willing readers. Other ''hilye'' writers express, usually at the end of the ''hilye'', their desire to be commended to the esteem of Muhammad, the other prophets, or the four caliphs. One ''hilye'' writer, Hakim, wrote that he wishes that people will remember Muhammad as they look at his ''hilye''.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

Hakani's Hilye-i Şerif has been an object of affection to many Turkish people. His poem has been copied on paper as well as on wooden panels by many calligraphers and has been read with the accompaniment of music in [[Mawlid]] ceremonies.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poyraz"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Poyraz, Yakup| title= Hâkim Seyyid Mehmed Efendi'nin "Nazire-i Hilye-i Hâkanî" Adlı Eseri | journal= Turkish Studies | issue= 2/3 | pages= 449–484 | year= 2007 | url= | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Ottoman forms===
{{Muhammad}}
As an art form, ''hilye'' has mostly been restricted to Ottoman lands. A small number of instances of ''hilye'' panels were made in Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=حِليهنويسى | publisher=Encyclopaedia Islamica | author= | accessdate=2012-01-20 | url=http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=6490 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004312/http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=6490 | archivedate=2014-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they reflect a Shiite adaptation of the form: there is a Persian translation below the Arabic text and the names of the [[Twelve Imams]] are listed. In the 19th century, some Iranian ''hilyes'' combined the traditional ''hilye'' format with the Iranian tradition of pictorial representation of Muhammad and Ali.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hilye_Iran_19th_c_with_image.JPG this image] for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oleg"&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad| author=Grabar, O | journal= Écriture, Calligraphie et Peinture | issue= | year=2003 | pages=19–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are contemporary exponents of the art outside this region, such as the [[Pakistan]]i calligrapher [[Rasheed Butt]] and the American calligrapher [[Mohamed Zakariya]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"/&gt;

===Traditions===
In Turkey, giving a ''hilye'' panel as a marriage gift for the happiness of the union and safety of the home has been a tradition that is disappearing.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt; Covering such panels with sheer curtains was part of the religious folklore in Istanbul households.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;

Since Osman's time, every Turkish calligrapher has been expected to produce at least one ''hilye'', using the three ''muhaqqaq'', ''thuluth'' and ''naskh'' scripts.&lt;ref name=Ali8/&gt; It is a common tradition for masters of calligraphy to obtain their diploma of competency (''icazetname'') after completing a ''hilye'' panel as their final assignment.&lt;ref name="derman"/&gt;

The art of ''hilye'' flourishes in Turkey. Contemporary artists continue to create ''hilyes'' in the classical form as well as to innovate. Modern ''hilyes'' maintain the essence of a ''hilye'', even while the appearance of the elements of the ''hilye'' is customized or calligraphy is used to create abstract or figurative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Conoscere la Turchia a Roma | publisher= Piu Culture | url= http://www.piuculture.it/2011/10/conoscere-la-turchia-a-roma/ | accessdate= 2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary ''hilyes'' are exhibited in major exhibitions in Turkey as well as outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Vatican to host Turkish exhibition at Cancellaria | publisher= Hürriyet Daily News | url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=vatican-to-host-turkish-exhibition-at-cancellaria-2011-09-29 | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Masterpieces of calligraphy art on view at Yıldız Palace | publisher= Hürriyet Daily News | url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/masterpieces-of-calligraphy-art-on-view-at-yildiz-palace.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=6906&amp;NewsCatID=385 | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological opinion==
According to the Süleymaniye Vakfı, a [[Salafi]] influenced religious foundation in Turkey that publishes religious opinions ([[fatwa]]), ''hilye'' panels are works of art, but hanging them in the home has no religious value. That is, they provide no merit to those who hang them or carry them on their persons, and those who do not possess them have no deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Hilye-i Şerif nedir?

==A key hilye in poetry: Hilye-i Şerif==
{{Wikisource|1=Translation of an excerpt from the "Hilya-i Sharifa"|2=Hilye-i Şerif}}
''[[Hilye-i Şerif]]'' ("The Noble Description", 1598–1599) by [[Mehmet Hakani]], consisting of 712 verses, lists Muhammad's features as reported by Ali (see quotation in the [[#Origins|Origins]] section above), then comments on each of them in 12-20 verses.&lt;ref name="Gibb"&gt;{{cite book| title= A history of Ottoman poetry, Volume 3| author= Elias John Wilkinson Gibb| publisher= Luzac | year=1904 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MSxkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have found it to be of not great poetic merit, it was popular due to its subject matter.&lt;ref name="Gibb"/&gt; The poem is significant for having established the genre of ''hilye''. Later ''hilye'' writers such as [[Cevri İbrahim Çelebi|Cevri]], [[Nesati]] and [[Süleyman Nahifi|Nafihi]] have praised Hakani and stated that they were following in his footsteps.&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; The poem contains several themes detailed below that underscore the importance of reading and writing about the attributes of Muhammad.

In his ''hilye'', Hakani mentions the following hadith, which he attributes to Ali:&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt; A short time before Muhammad's death, when his crying daughter Fatima said to him: "Ya Rasul-Allah, I will not be able to see your face any more!" Muhammad commanded, "Ya Ali, write down my appearance, for seeing my qualities is like seeing myself." The origin of this hadith is not known. Although probably [[apocryphal]], it has had a fundamental effect on the development of the ''hilye'' genre. This hadith has been repeated by most other ''hilye'' writers.&lt;ref name="Yazar"/&gt;

Hakani states another hadith, also attributed to Ali. This hadith of unknown origin is said to have been in circulation since the 9th century&lt;ref name=Soucek&gt;{{cite journal |author=Soucek, Priscilla |year= 2000 |title= The Theory and Practice of Portraiture in the Persian Tradition |journal= Muqarnas |volume= 17 |issue= |pages= 97–108 |publisher= |doi= 10.1163/22118993-90000008|pmid= |pmc= |url= http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/files/Roxburgh_Reading1.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not found in the reliable hadith collections.&lt;ref name=Zakariya&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hilye of the Prophet Muhammad |last=Zakariya |first=Mohamed |authorlink=Mohamed Zakariya |date=2003–2004 |journal=Seasons |publisher=Zaytuna Institute |pages=13–22 |url=http://zakariya.net/resources/hilye.pdf |accessdate=August 22, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202234841/http://zakariya.net/resources/hilye.pdf |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated in other ''hilyes'' after Hakani's, this hadith has been influential in the establishment of the genre.:&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gruber132 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book |title= Following Muhammad: Rethinking Islam in the Contemporary World |last=Ernst |first= Carl W. |authorlink=Carl W.

{{quotation|For him who sees my ''hilye'' after my death, it is as if he had seen me myself, and he who sees it, longing for me, for him God will make [[Jahannam|Hell]] prohibited, and he will not be resurrected naked on the [[Qiyamah|Day of Judgement]].}}

Hakani's ''hilye'' includes a story about a poor man coming to the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and presenting him a piece of paper on which Muhammad's ''hilye'' is written. Al-Rashid is so delighted to see this that he regales the dervish and rewards him with sacs of jewelry. At night, he sees Muhammad in his dream. Muhammad says to him "you received and honored this poor man, so I will make you happy. God gave me the good news that whoever looks at my ''hilye'' and gets delight from it, presses it to his chest and protects it like his life, will be protected from hellfires on Doomsday; he will not suffer in this world nor in the other. You will be worthy of the sight of my face, and even more, of my holy lights."&lt;ref name="Erdogan"/&gt;

It has become customary for other ''hilye'' authors that followed Hakani to mention in the introduction of their ''hilye'' (called ''havas-i hilye'') the hadith that seeing Muhammad in one's dream is the same as seeing him. The Harun Al-Rashid story has also been mentioned frequently by other authors as well.&lt;ref name="ispirli"&gt;{{cite journal| title= Mustafa Fehmi Gerçeker'in Hilye-i Fahr-ı Âlem İsimli Eseri Üzerine | author= İspirli, S.A.| year= 2010 | journal= Turkısh Studies | issue=2 | pages= 21–36| url=http://dokuman.tsadergisi.org/dergiler_pdf/2010/2010-Agustos/7.pdf | language = Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements from Hakani's ''hilye'' have established the belief that reading and writing ''hilyes'' protects the person from all trouble, in this world as well as the next.

'''''Hurry Sundown''''' is a 1967 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]], and starring [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Michael Caine]].&lt;ref name="Hurry Sundown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4647/Hurry-Sundown/|title=Hurry Sundown|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay by [[Horton Foote]] and Thomas C. Ryan is based on the 1965 novel of the same title by [[Katya Alpert Gilden|K.B. Gilden]], a [[pseudonym]] for the married couple Katya and Bert Gilden. It marked [[Faye Dunaway]]'s film debut.

==Plot==
In 1946, bigoted, draft-dodging Henry Warren and his wife Julie Ann, owners of a Northern canning plant, are determined to purchase a large tract of uncultivated farmland in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Two plots remain beyond their grasp, one owned by Henry's cousin Rad McDowell and his wife Lou, the other by black farmer Reeve Scott, whose mother Rose had been Julie's mammy. Neither man is interested in selling his land, and they form a partnership to strengthen their claim to it, which infuriates Henry.

When Rose suddenly dies, Henry tries to persuade his wife to charge Reeve with illegal ownership of his property, but local teacher Vivian Thurlow searches the town's records and uncovers proof that Reeve legally registered the deed to his land. Julie, upset with Henry's treatment of their mentally challenged son, decides to leave him and drops her suit against Reeve.

With the help of [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, Henry dynamites the [[levee]] above the farms, and Rad's oldest child drowns in the ensuing flood, much to Henry's dismay. Rather than admit defeat, Rad and Reeve decide to rebuild their decimated property with the assistance of their neighbors.

==Production==
Otto Preminger was shown the [[galley proof]] of the 1,046-page Gilden manuscript by his brother [[Ingo Preminger|Ingo]] and, fully expecting it to be another ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', purchased the film rights to the novel for $100,000 eight months prior to its publication. He initially intended to adapt it for a four-and-a-half-hour [[epic film]] that would be shown twice-a-day at what would be the highest price scale in the history of American film exhibition, with a top admission of $25 on Friday and Saturday nights. When the book sold a mere 300,000 copies, Preminger decided a less grandiose project might be in order.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 410–411&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he admired his screenplay for the [[Harper Lee]] novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Preminger hired [[Horton Foote]] to adapt the Gilden book, which the author thought was "embarrassing," with "no genuine Southern flavor at all." His first instinct was to decline the offer, but he then decided he could do something with it, so Preminger installed him and his family in a house in [[London]], where the director was filming ''[[Bunny Lake Is Missing]]''. Foote completed his draft in three months, but Preminger was unhappy with it, feeling it was missing the melodrama and theatricality the story required. He paid Foote his full fee and dismissed him, although he later insisted on giving the writer screen credit, which Foote accepted. (In later years he admitted he never saw the film and never included it on his résumé.) Preminger replaced Foote with Thomas C. Ryan, who worked for him as his chief [[Publisher's reader|reader]] and was familiar with the type of material his employer found appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 411–412&lt;/ref&gt;

Preminger wanted to shoot the entire film in Georgia, and in November and December 1965 he visited the state to scout locations, but a union dispute changed his plans. Because he would be filming during the oppressively hot and humid months of June through August, he planned to shoot at night as much as possible. The New York union, which had jurisdiction over Georgia, demanded crews be paid double for any filming after 4:00pm, an added expense Preminger knew would be prohibitive. [[Production designer]] [[Gene Callahan (production designer)|Gene Callahan]] suggested his home state of [[Louisiana]] might be a viable alternative, since the unions there were governed by the more liberal one in Chicago. [[Baton Rouge]] and its environs were selected, and Callahan's crew began planting cornfields, erecting shanties, and constructing a dam and [[reservoir]] containing 17.5 million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start, Preminger and his cast and crew encountered strong resistance from the locals, who resented having a film featuring a biracial friendship made in their midst. Tires were slashed, some actors received telephoned death threats, and a burning cross appeared on one of the sets at 3am. The manager of the hotel where everyone was housed, the Bellemont Motor Hotel, advised Preminger [[mixed bathing]] would not be permitted in the swimming pools, but grudgingly agreed to designate one "interracial" when the director threatened to vacate the premises and not pay the bill. At one point a "crude bomb" was thrown into the desegregated pool, but no one was injured as it happened late at night.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, Faye, and Sharkey, Betsey, ''Looking for Gatsby''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster 1998. {{ISBN|0-671-67526-5}}, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually armed state troopers were called in to guard the hotel wing where everyone was staying, making them feel as if they were under [[house arrest]]. Problems were encountered even in [[New Orleans]], when Michael Caine and Bobby Hooks were refused admission to [[Brennan's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Michael, ''What's It All About? The Autobiography.'' Random House, Australia, 1992. {{ISBN|0 09 182648 9}}, p 233&lt;/ref&gt;  Matters came to a head when a convoy of cars and trucks returning to the hotel through a heavily wooded area one evening became the target of a volley of [[sniper]] gunfire. [[Robert Hooks]] later recalled, "All of us were convinced that we were surrounded by some of the dumbest and meanest people on the face of the earth, to say nothing of being the most cowardly." &lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 414–417&lt;/ref&gt;

Midway through filming, Preminger had to replace cinematographer Loyal Griggs with [[Milton R. Krasner]] when Griggs seriously injured his back. He later banned screenwriter Ryan from the set for talking to [[Rex Reed]] for an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. In it Reed characterized the director as an autocrat who was losing his grip, quoted [[Michael Caine]] as saying, "He's only happy when everybody else is miserable," and claimed Griggs had been fired by Preminger "in a moment of uncontrolled fury." Griggs demanded and received a retraction from the ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, Otto, ''Preminger: An Autobiography''. New York: Doubleday 1977. {{ISBN|0-385-03480-6}}, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Preminger greatly regretted casting [[Faye Dunaway]], with whom he clashed on a regular basis. She felt the director didn't know "anything at all about the process of acting." She resented having him yell at her in public and commented, "Once I've been crossed, I'm not very conciliatory." After filming was completed, she sued Preminger to win her release from the five-film contract she had signed with him. An out-of-court settlement was reached in March 1968. Dunaway later admitted, "It cost me a lot of money to not work for Otto again . . . I regretted paying him [but] I thought he was awful."&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, Faye, and Sharkey, Betsey, ''Looking for Gatsby''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster 1998. {{ISBN|0-671-67526-5}}, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, pp. 420–422&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The movie opened to unfavorable reviews from those who felt that Preminger was out of tune with the problems of the contemporary South. It was also criticized for its out-of-date racial stereotyping and tasteless attitude toward sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time|The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (and how they got that way)]]'' by Harry Medved, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' called the film "a frustrating case, not good but not particularly bad, with a smokescreen of controversy surrounding it and obscuring its real faults. The trouble with this film . . . is not that it's racist and tasteless, but that it's naive and dull."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670529/REVIEWS/705290301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosley Crowther of ''The New York Times'' described the film as "pure [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]" and "an offense to intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' observed "Obviously, ''Hurry Sundown'' was intended as a paean to racial justice, but Producer-Director Otto Preminger chooses strange ways to display his big brotherhood. One sequence shows Negro sharecroppers singing a white-eyed hallelujah number reminiscent of those '40s films that pretended to liberalize but patently patronized. Two hours of such cinematic clichés make the viewer intolerant of everyone in the film, regardless of race, creed or color."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941114,00.html ''Time'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Variety'' wrote that "Otto Preminger has created an outstanding, tasteful but hard-hitting, and handsomely-produced film . . . Told with a depth and frankness, the story develops its theme in a welcome, straight-forward way that is neither propaganda nor mere exploitation material."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791843.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Out London'' wrote that "The Preminger flair which made ''[[The Cardinal]]'' so enjoyable, despite its hackneyed script, seems to have deserted him in this lumbering melodrama, put together with the sort of crudely opportunistic style which alternates scenes of the rich folks parading in a stately mansion with shots of the poor sitting down to their humble fare while thumping mood music makes sure you get the point."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72426/Hurry_Sundown.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601164821/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72426/Hurry_Sundown.html |date=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel 4 noted "Preminger wears a liberal heart on his sleeve and then blows his nose on it as heavy-handed sentimentality and nobility dominate this story . . . God, sex, class, guilt, moralizing and Negro spirituals are all thrown into the stew, and you'll come away feeling that although it's worthy in its ideals, it could have done with a touch less overblown melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=104424&amp;section=review ''Channel 4 review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Legion of Decency]] gave the film a "C", "Condemned" rating, citing the portrayal of Blacks and portrayal of sex.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time|The Fifty Worst Films of All Time (and how they got that way)]]'' by Harry Medved, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
Faye Dunaway won the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]] for her performances in this and ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1967 BAFTA archives]&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]] but lost to [[Katharine Ross]] in ''[[The Graduate]]''.

'''''John Ruskin''''' is a painting of the leading [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art critic [[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900).&lt;ref&gt;Greer Gehler,  [http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/gehler3.html Millais's Portrait of John Ruskin], [[The Victorian Web]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcgallery.com/M/millais/millais7.html Sir John Everett Millais. John Ruskin. 1854. Oil on canvas. Private collection.] [http://www.abcgallery.com/ Olga's Gallery].&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] (1829–1896) during 1853–54. John Ruskin was an early advocate of the Pre-Raphaelite group of artists and part of their success was due to his efforts.

The painting depicts Ruskin in front of a [[waterfall]] in [[Glenfinlas]], [[Scotland]]. Ruskin and Millais spent the summer of 1853 together at Glenfinlas in the [[Trossachs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pages 228–234, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was especially interested in the [[rock formation]]s and undertook his own studies of these.

==Creation==
The painting of Ruskin was started at Glenfinlas, during which the details of the landscape were painted. The last stages of work on the painting were undertaken in Millais' studio in London. By that time Ruskin's wife [[Effie Gray|Effie]] had fallen in love with Millais. She left Ruskin and sued him for an annulment of the marriage. She and Millais were married the following year.

Millais found it very difficult to be in the same room as Ruskin when he was completing the work in London, calling it "the most hateful task I have ever had to perform".&lt;ref name = "beeb"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-22580920 BBC News, "Oxford's Ashmolean museum acquires Millais John Ruskin portrait"]&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the portrait was finished he broke off contact with Ruskin. Ruskin himself temporarily moved the portrait so that his father would not see it, since he was concerned that he would damage or destroy it.

==Provenance==
The painting was given by Ruskin to his friend [[Henry Wentworth Acland]] in 1871. It was passed down through his family until it was sold at Christie's in 1965. The purchaser retained the painting until their death in 2012. It was accepted by the British Government in lieu of inheritance tax in 2013 and permanently allocated to the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]] to which it had been on loan since 2012.&lt;ref name = "beeb"/&gt;
 
The painting has been exhibited several times, including exhibitions on the Pre-Raphaelites at [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]] in 1984 and in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelite-vision-truth-nature Pre-Raphaelite Vision: Truth to Nature], [[Tate Britain]], London, UK, 12 February – 3 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It is valued at £7.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwadminoxacuk/localsites/finance/documents/financehome/2012-13_Giles%27_commentary_on_Financial_Statements.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen Fox'''  (12 September 1880 – 17 August 1963) was an Irish painter, enamellist, and stained-glass artist.&lt;ref name=Minch&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minch|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=Fox, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Kathleen Fox was born in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Dublin/Lucan/Cooldrinagh/3718/|title=National Archives: Census of Ireland, 1911|last=|first=|date=|website=www.census.nationalarchives.ie|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 September 1880.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Her father was Captain Henry Charles Fox of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|King's Dragoon Guards]] and her mother was Mary Rebecca Colclough. Fox attended the [[National College of Art and Design|Dublin Metropolitan School of Art]], studying under [[William Orpen]]. Owing to her talent, she also worked as Orpen's assistant. Whilst in London, Fox met British army Lieutenant Cyril Pym, marrying him in 1917. Pym was killed in action in 1918, and Fox gave birth to their daughter later that year.&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt; She inherited the family home, Brookfield, Richmond Avenue South, Milltown, Co. Dublin&lt;ref name=Gray /&gt; moving there in 1947, dying there on 17 August 1963.&lt;ref name="The Model"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kathleen Fox|url=http://themodel.ie/the-niland-collection/artist/114|website=The Model|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early artistic work==
Fox studied enamelling under [[Oswald Reeves]]. She created an enamelled cup entitled ''Going to the feast'' for which she won a gold medal in a 1908 British competition. The cup was later exhibited with the other prizewinners at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and at the 1924 [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|Tailteann Games]] exhibition in Dublin. In 1909, Fox was awarded a national prize for ''Music'', an enamelled copper plaque. Whilst working under [[Alfred E. Child]] she worked in stained glass. Her 1909 window depicting St. Tobias is part of a family memorial in St. Joseph's church, Glenageary. Fox was working during a period of the [[Celtic Revival]], which had a distinct emphasis on craft-work and drew inspiration from medieval and Celtic design. Child also exposed her to the [[arts and crafts movement]], and some of her pieces such as ''Shaving mirror with pendant on stand'' (1910) shows a familiarity with the [[art nouveau]] style. Fox spent some time in London and Paris before the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt;

During the events of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], she traveled to Dublin to paint the events there. This earned her the nickname "little rebel" by the students of the Dublin Metropolitan School while she worked as an assistant to Orpen.&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt; One of her best known pieces of this period was the surrender of [[Constance Markievicz]], ''The arrest 1916, the Royal College of Surgeons'', which is now in [[The Niland Collection]] in The Model, Sligo.&lt;ref name=Bhreathnach-Lynch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhreathnach-Lynch|first1=Sighle|title=The Easter Rising 1916: constructing a canon in art &amp; artefacts|journal=History Ireland|date=1997|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-easter-rising-1916-constructing-a-canon-in-art-artefacts/|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Fox painted a portrait of her friend [[Grace Gifford]]. From 1911 to 1923 and 1944 to 1957, Fox exhibited 81 with the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA).&lt;ref name=Gray /&gt; One submission in 1911 was ''Science and Power'' and depicted her friend, sculptor [[Albert Power (sculptor)|Albert Power]], working on ''Science'' for the new College of Science, Merrion St. She later donated a version of this piece to the [[Hugh Lane Gallery|Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt;

==Later artistic work==
Fox focused on oil painting in the 1920s, establishing herself as a portrait painter. Her portrait of Lady Rosamund Gallwey-Robertson from 1921 was received very favourably when it was shown alongside works of Orpen and [[John Lavery]] at the National Portrait Society exhibition in London.&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt; Fox exhibited a portrait of [[Daniel Mannix|Archbishop Mannix]] in the same year at the Royal Academy. Her work was shown in London at the [[New English Art Club]], the [[Society of Women Artists]], and the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]]. Pieces were occasionally exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] and the [[Walker Art Gallery]], Liverpool.&lt;ref name="The Model" /&gt; One of Fox's enamel plaques was featured in an exhibition of Irish art in Brussels in 1930. Some of her paintings were also exhibited at Oireachtas exhibitions in Dublin.&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt;

Fox became known for her paintings of interiors and flowers in the 1940s and 1950s, examples of which were exhibited at the Dawson gallery in 1946. In the early 1950s she created the stations of the Cross for the Jesuit House of Studies, Milltown Park, Dublin in oils. Her work was included in the exhibition of contemporary Irish art at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales in 1953.&lt;ref name=Minch /&gt; Fox worked in numerous materials over the course of her career including painted china, wood carving, silver working, and costume design.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Sara|title=The Dictionary of British Women Artists|date=2009|publisher=The Lutterworth Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780718830847|pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kore of Lyons''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Coré de Lyon'') is a Greek statue of [[Pentelic marble]] depicting a bust of a young girl of the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] type, conserved at the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]], [[France]]. Deriving from the [[Athenian Acropolis]], it is generally dated to the 540s BC. Considered the centrepiece of the museum's antiquities department,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba-lyon.fr/mba/sections/fr/collections-musee/chefs-oeuvre/oeuvres1476/kore|website=Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon|title=Koré|access-date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the statue was acquired between 1808 and 1810.

The sculpture is fragmentary: the bust is conserved in the musée des beaux-arts de Lyon under the inventory number H 1993, while the lower portion and some fragments of the left arm are conserved in the [[Acropolis Museum]] in [[Athens]], under inventory number ''Acr.'' 269. After a series of comparisons, the connection between the fragments was definitively established in 1935 by [[Humfry Payne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The "Aphrodite" of Lyons|author=Humfry Payne|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=55 part 2|year=1935|page=228|editor=The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies|doi=10.2307/627371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the numerous [[Korai of the Acropolis of Athens]] discovered during the construction of the old [[Acropolis Museum]] in the [[Perserschutt]], a layer of destruction from the [[Persian Wars]], containing material from the 570s BC down to the end of the sixth century BC. It represents the first example of the [[Ionians|Ionian]] influence which entered Attic sculpture in the second half of the century and first use of Ionian costume in [[Attica]]. The Kore of Lyons is of the generation after the oldest Kore discovered on the Acropolis, ''Acropolis 593'', and represents the beginning of the new phase of Attic sculpture beginning in the third quarter of the sixth century.

The Kore of Lyons has been suggested to have had an architectural function as a [[caryatid]]&lt;ref name=Marszal/&gt; or a votive function.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

Characteristic of its type, the Kore of Lyons is a [[pentelic marble]] sculpture measuring 64&amp;nbsp;cm in height, 36&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 24&amp;nbsp;cm deep.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; It depicts the bust of a majestic young woman, who holds an offering against her breast, a bird, identified by some as a dove. The sculpture was painted.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; Influenced by the art of the Ionian coast, it is dressed in a [[chiton]] and [[himation]]. She wears a [[polos]] atop her head and earrings.

=== Identification difficulties ===
Mountfaucon and Grosson described it as an Egyptian statue at the beginning of the 18th century. This theory was rapidly dismissed, but its identification remained debated. A certain [[Egyptomania]] caused some researchers to see a "[[Gaul|Gallic]] [[Isis]]," while others perceived an "Archaic [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]."&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; It had to wait until the beginning of the 20th century and a greater understanding of Greek art to refine the analysis; in the meantime identifications included an Ionian Aphrodite, an [[Athena]] or the [[Sidon]]ian [[Astarte]] of [[Paphos]], assimilated to Aphrodite.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;
In 1923 Henri Lechat published  an inventory of the collection of casts of the [[Lumière University Lyon 2]] where he described the statue as "the upper part of a statue of Aphrodite ... clad in the Ionian fashion... a kore, specifically a goddess by the polos on her head and identified as Aphrodite by the done in her right hand."&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; But Pane refuted this hypothesis, arguing that the polos is not strictly a divine attribute and restated the hypotheses that it was a caryatid on account of a hole present at the top of the head for the attachment of a [[Mortise and tenon|tenon]], or a [[votive]] statue on account of its small size.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

=== Ionian or Attic? ===

==== Costume ====
The statue has the compact and robust structure which is typical of this period in Attica and goes back to the ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Berlin_Goddess Berlin Goddess]'' ([[Pergamon Museum]] SK 1800, first quarter of the sixth century). Ionian characteristics are clear, notably the costume, composed of a [[chiton]] with long sleeves and a [[himation]] pinned diagonally over one shoulder. In sculpture and Attic [[Black figure pottery#Attica|black figure pottery]], contemporary women wear the sleeveless [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] over a light chiton and the himation, when it is present at all, is pinned at both shoulders. The sole archaic Attic representation with wears the chiton without the peplos over it is the Berlin Goddess, but she wears the himation in the traditional symmetric manner. In Ionia on the other hand, the diagonal himation is very well attested from the second quarter of the 6th century BC, e.g. on the statues dedicated by [[Cheramyes]]; not only is the origin of this garment Ionian, but also the treatment of the drapery, which is found in the representations of the ''columnae caelatae'' of the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]] (generally dated to 560 BC). Another stylistic element of the Kore of Lyons is the curve of the himation above the buttocks which is not subsequently imitated by Attic sculptors, but is fairly frequent in contemporary vase painting and marble sculpture of the Greek East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvsp|Payne|1936|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stylistic Syncretism ====
[[File:Kore from the acropolis of athens.jpg|thumb|The statue in its vitrine at the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lyon]].]]
These different influences (Ionian and Athenian) mean that even today the identification of the statue is not possible.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; However, according to some stylistic and technical criteria, the statue belongs to Attic sculpture of the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] (thick hair, receding chin, almond shaped eyes) while undergoing Ionian influence (chiselled rounding, softened facial lines) which increased at the end of the sixth century.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; It must however be noted that the Ionian elements are in the majority, notably the typically Ionian long-sleeved chiton, the Ionian himation and the polos decorated with lotus flowers and palmettes. However the material, Pentalic marble from north of Athens, and the rigorous composition settle the question in favour of an Attic origin.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

The Kore of Lyons is evidence of a stylistic syncretism. Its hestitant proportions, the stiff awkward robustness and the non-realistic details allow the statue to be dated to the "mature" Archaic period, around 550-540 BC.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

=== Function ===
The question of the architectural function of the Kore of Lyons was solved by [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]] in 1986; the upper part of the polos has some characteristics typical of caryatids, which Payne did not observe directly, but only through casts sent to Athens. The sculpture has a nick on the upper part for a tenon,&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; supporting the theory of an architectural role. Another element supporting this conclusion is the reversal of the diagonal himation (going over the left rather than the more usual right shoulder) which is typical of mirrored pairs rather than isolated works. In addition the origin of the Ionian influence detected in the style of the work matches the near eastern origin of the caryatid as an architectural feature. On the other hand, the kore is very small and would only fit as the caryatid of a small [[naiskos]] or a secondary entrance and even then it would have to have been placed on top of a podium.&lt;ref name=Marszal&gt;{{Harvsp|Marszal|1988|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A votive function cannot be excluded therefore.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

== History ==

=== First mention and acquisition by le musée de Lyon ===
How the sculpture came from Greece to the south of France is unknown. It is possible that it was brought back by a seventeenth century aristocrat on the [[Grand Tour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db.classics.cam.ac.uk:8080/collections/casts/kore-lyons|website=University of Cambridge|title=Kore of Lyons|access-date=5 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162829/http://db.classics.cam.ac.uk:8080/collections/casts/kore-lyons|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the voyage taken by young gentlemen of the upper classes of European society in order to complete their education, then based on the study of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Before the connection of the fragments from the Acropolis with the torso in the musée de Lyon it was called the ''Aphrodite of Marseille'' and is mentioned for the first time in 1719 by Montfaucon in the second volume of his work, ''L'Antiquité expliquée'', where he says that it was kept in "cabinet of Monsieur [Laurent] Gravier in [[Marseille]]"&lt;ref name="mi"&gt;Morgane Ivanoff, ''La 'korè' de Lyon'', Université Lumière Lyon 2, [[musée des moulages (Lyon)|musée des moulages]], Lettres et Arts 2008/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jcm"/&gt; and described it as belonging to Egyptian style, with an owl in the right hand;&lt;ref name="jcm"/&gt;  there followed a series of publications of unverified data, which claimed the city of Marseille as the place of discovery, a claim which seemed plausible because it was the site of [[Marseille|Massalia]], an ancient colony of the Ionian city of [[Phocaea]], founded in the 600s BC. Among various undocumented owners of the kore, it seems, according to Henri Lechat, to have been part of the collection Tempier of [[Nîmes]], sold by a Lyonese antiquities dealer named Mercier in December 1810 for the nascent local museum. Lechat declared it to be "Greek, from Asia Minor."&lt;ref name="jcm"/&gt; According to other sources, the musée de Lyon acquired the statue from the collection of Monsieur Pinochi of Nîmes.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; From this period, the statue was incomplete, notably lacking its left arm and its legs. The kore is present in the catalogue of the musée de Lyon of 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=François|first=Artaud|title=Cabinet des antiques du musée de Lyon|location=Lyon|publisher=impr. de Pelzin|year=1816|page=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''polos'' on the head and the dove were considered sufficient evidence to identify the statue as a representation of [[Aphrodite]] and the presence of the diagonal [[himation]] led to the conclusion that the statue was of Ionian origin.

=== Fragments reunited ===
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Greece 6-9 December 2001-10.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] visiting the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens in front of the [[Rampin Rider]], at extreme left, and the parts of the Kore of Lyons kept in the museum combined with casts of those in Lyon]]
Much later, research by [[Humfry Payne]] of the [[British School at Athens]] led to the rediscovery of the lower part of a statue which he thought to correspond to the "Aphrodite with the dove" (the name by which the statue was then known).&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; A cast of the kore created at the request of Payne confirmed this hypothesis. He was even able to identify fragments of hair and most importantly of the left arm in the uninventoried fragments of the Acropolis Museum.&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt; The various fragments were reunited at the end of the 1930s to reconstitute the statue, which was thereby definitively identified as one of the [[Korai of the Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;ref name="mi"/&gt;

=== De-restoration ===
The main fragment in Lyon consisting of the upper part of the kore was supplemented by casts of the fragments in the museum at Athens until 1994. These elements were removed according to "a museological principle that desired, for the sake of archaeological and scientific truth, only to display the true material of what was possessed, without use of representational devices, such as completing the sculpture with other materials, plaster in this case, as if this plaster was a precise substitute for truth"&lt;ref name="jcm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcmo.wordpress.com/category/01-la-core-de-lyon/|website=jcmo.wordpress.com|title=La Coré de Lyon|access-date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Professor Jean-Claude Mossière, associate member for the study of ancient and contemporary Greece at the [[French School at Athens]] put it. Unlike the musée de Lyon, the Acropolis Museum has chosen to continue to present the fragments it possesses with a plaster cast of the upper portion.&lt;ref name="jcm"/&gt;

Naruto, Sakura, [[Rock Lee|Lee]], and Kakashi are assigned to protect the prince of the Land of Moon, Michiru Tsuki, and his son, Hikaru Tsuki. Initially, Naruto is incensed by the pair's spoiled nature, especially Hikaru's. Eventually, after Hikaru shows his bravery during a storm, when he saves a tiger, Naruto warms up to him. When they arrive in the Land of Moon, the king's minister, Shabadaba, has orchestrated a coup with the aid of several ninja, mortally wounding the present king in the process. As Michiru and Hikaru are shepherded to safety, the hired ninja, under the command of their leader, Ishidate, manage to abduct Michiru. Naruto convinces Hikaru to organize a rescue operation, and the ninja are defeated, with Michiru and Hikaru aiding Naruto in defeating Ishidate. After the battle, Michiru becomes the new king, learning the importance of caring for his family instead of material possessions.

|ShortSummary =  [[Konohamaru]] is in love with a girl, Yoshino Kaede, who is moving away from the village. He wishes to win her heart with a crimson [[four-leaf clover]], which is also supposed to grant any wish. Konohamaru asks [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to help him find it, but they have to travel into the forbidden zone, Akagahara, to retrieve it. After activating almost every trap on the way to the clover, the pair are attacked by marionettes after moving a statue to reach the clover. [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and [[Sakura Haruno]] appear to help, but they still cannot defeat them. At last, the marionettes shut off after Konohamaru lifts the statue back to its original position. Then, one of the leaves fall off. Konohamaru still gives the clover to Kaede, and she kisses him on his cheek.

Shibuki is a coward, however, due to circumstances surrounding his father's death. The Hidden Village has a secret bottle of water called the "Hero's Water", which imbues whoever drinks it with a dramatic, but temporary, increase in chakra. The effects are similar to opening a "chakra gate", in that it can shorten lifespan as well. Five missing-nin come to the village to steal the Hero's Water, and Team 7 defends against the incursion.

This article is a '''list of the [[palette (computing)|color palette]]s''' for notable [[computer graphics]], [[Computer terminal|terminals]] and [[video game console]] hardware.

Only a sample and the palette's name are given here. More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references).

In the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the [[VESA]] consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Often, as with early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, [[Computer software|software]] developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette.

In order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full [[RGB]] repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ [[indexed color]] techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console|videogame console]]s of various brands.

The list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]s with an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer ''ages'' or ''generations'' (around 1975&amp;ndash;1985 and 1985&amp;ndash;1995, respectively) and their associated [[state of the art]] in color display capabilities.

Here is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles:

==List of monochrome and RGB palettes==

{{main|List of monochrome and RGB palettes}}

For the purpose of this article, the term ''monochrome palette'' means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term ''RGB palette'' is defined as the complete set of combinations a given [[RGB]] display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware.

These are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.

For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than [[RGB]], see the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of videogame consoles]] sections.

For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth|depth]] displays, see the [[List of palettes#List of software palettes|List of software palettes]] section.

===Regular RGB palettes===

:These full RGB palettes employ the same number of [[bit]]s to store the relative intensity for the red, green and blue components of every image's [[pixel]] color. Thus, they have the same number of levels per channel and the total number of possible colors is always the cube of a power of two. It should be understood ''that 'when developed' ''many of these formats were directly related to the size of some host computers 'natural word length' in bytes&amp;mdash;the amount of memory in bits held by a single memory address such that the CPU can grab or put it in one operation.

===Non-regular RGB palettes===

:These are also RGB palettes, in the sense defined above (except for the 4-bit RGBI, which has an intensity bit that affects all channels at once), but either they do not have the same number of levels for each primary channel, or the numbers are not powers of two, so are not represented as separate bit fields.  All of these have been used in popular [[personal computer]]s.

==List of software palettes==

{{main|List of software palettes}}

Systems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit pixel [[Color depth|depth]] can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously. Many [[personal computer]]s in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette.

Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commonly used with the 8 bpp palettes as ''master palettes'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).

These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems.

===System specific palettes===

:These are selections of colors officially employed as system palettes in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that feature 8-bit displays.

==List of computer hardware palettes==

In early [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors.  In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by [[resistor]] combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer.

Many early models output [[composite video]] [[YPbPr]] colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system).

For current RGB display systems for [[Personal computer|PC]]'s ([[Super VGA]], etc.), see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] for [[HighColor]] (''thousands'') and [[TrueColor]] (''millions of colors'') modes.

For [[video game console]]s, see the [[List of color palettes#Video game console palettes|List of videogame consoles]] section.

For every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes.

The list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9549">'''Louis Charles Christopher Krieger''' (11 February 1873&amp;nbsp;– 31 July 1940) was an American [[mycology|mycologist]] and [[botanical illustrator]] who was considered the finest painter of North American fungi.&lt;ref name=kbs/&gt;

==Personal life==

Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on February 11, 1873, Krieger received his early education from the [[Lutheran]] schools in that city. He showed artistic talents at an early age, and at 13 enrolled in the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute School of Art and Design]]. Krieger continued his studies at the [[Charcoal Club of Baltimore]] and the [[Schuler School of Fine Arts]]. He married Agnes Checkley Keighler in 1904; she died in 1939. They had one daughter.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Russula virescens illustration 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Krieger's illustration of ''[[Russula virescens]]'', from [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor's]] 1898 work ''Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America Edible and Poisonous'']]

At the age of 18, Krieger started employment as an artist assistant in the Division of Microscopy at the Department of Agriculture, and spent time painting mushrooms found around the [[District of Columbia]] area.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; When the [[Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Julius Sterling Morton]], closed the department in 1895, Krieger spent a year in [[Munich]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]]. After returning to America in 1896, he became an instructor of drawing and painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and Design. Although he developed a reputation as a portrait painter, Krieger did not particularly enjoy this employment, finding it dull.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

In 1902, Krieger started working as a [[botanical illustrator]] for mycologist [[William Gilson Farlow]] at [[Harvard University]], a position that lasted for the next decade. During this time, he earnestly immersed himself in his work, painting over 350 images of mushrooms.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; He also started indexing the world's mycological literature, a project that continued for the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

In 1912, Krieger accepted a position at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], at the Plant Introduction Garden in [[Chico, California]]. Here, under the supervision of [[David Griffiths (botanist)|David Griffiths]], he produced a series of images on species of the ''[[Opuntia]]'' [[cactus]] genus.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt;

Krieger returned to illustrating mushrooms in 1918 when he returned to Baltimore to work for the noted gynecologist [[Howard A. Kelly]], for whom he produced over 300 paintings of fungi.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt; He also assisted Kelly in indexing his mycological library, which, with about 12,000 items and valued at $100,000, was considered one of the most extensive privately owned mycological libraries in the country.&lt;ref name="Kanouse 1943"/&gt; Kelly donated his library and fungus collections to the [[University of Michigan]], where, according to Kelly's wishes, it was named the "L.C.C. Krieger Mycological Library".&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

[[File:Krieger cherries-Marasca-Moscata-1933.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of Marasca Moscata variety of cherry (''Prunus avium'') by Louis Charles Christopher Krieger, 1933.]]

Over the following 10 years, Krieger published several scientific articles that appeared in ''[[Mycologia]]'' and other journals, including the May 1920 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', which featured 16 of his colored plates.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt;

Krieger was an artist with the Tropical Plant Research Foundation in Cuba from 1928–29, where he illustrated [[sugarcane]] diseases for the USDA. He was briefly a mycologist with the [[New York State Museum]], during which time he prepared the book ''A Popular Guide to the Higher Fungi (Mushrooms) of New York State'', which was eventually published in 1935.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 1941"/&gt; In the 1930s, he painted some 80 watercolors of fruit for USDA, mainly apples, citrus, and stone fruit; these paintings are now in the National Agricultural Library's [[United States National Agricultural Library#Pomological Watercolor Collection|Pomological Watercolor Collection]].

'''Mapuche silverwork''' is one of the best known aspects of [[Mapuche]] material culture.&lt;ref name=Painecura15&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The adornments have been subject to changes in fashion but some designs have resisted change.

==History==
In the later half of the 18th century, Mapuche [[silversmith]]s began to produce large amounts of silver finery.&lt;ref name=Aldunate&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aldunate |first=Carlos |last2= |first2= |year=1984 |title=Reflexiones acerca de la platería mapuche |url=http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=Cultura-Hombre-Sociedad |publisher= |volume=1 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203065926/http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surge of silversmithing activity may be related to the [[Parliament of Quillín (1641)|1641 parliament of Quillín]] and the [[1726 parliament of Negrete]] that decreased hostilities between Spaniards and Mapuches and allowed trade to increase between [[colonial Chile]] and the free Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt; In this context of increasing trade, Mapuches began in the late 18th century to accept payments in [[silver coin]]s for their products; usually cattle or horses.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; These coins and silver coins obtained in political negotiations served as raw material for Mapuche metalsmiths ([[Mapudungun]]: ''rüxafe'').&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kangiser/&gt; Old Mapuche silver [[pendant]]s often included unmelted silver coins, something that has helped modern researchers to date the objects.&lt;ref name=Kangiser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kangiser Gómez |first=María Fernanda |last2= |first2= |year=2002 |title=Conservación en platería mapuche: Museo Fonck, Viña del Mar |url=http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |journal=Conserva |publisher= |volume=6 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234953/http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the Spanish silver coins originated from mining in [[Potosí]] in [[Upper Peru]].&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great diversity in silver finery designs is indebted to the fact that designs were done to be identified with different ''reynma'' (families), ''lof mapu'' (lands) as well as specific [[lonko]]s and [[machi (shaman)|machi]]s.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mapuche silver finery was also subject to changes in [[fashion]] albeit designs associated with philosophical and spiritual concepts have not undergone major changes.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28/&gt;

In late 18th century and early 19th century, Mapuche silversmithing activity and artistic diversity reached it climax.&lt;ref name=Painecura30&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All important Mapuche chiefs of the 19th century are supposed to have had at least one silversmith.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; The [[Occupation of Araucanía|1869 war between Chile and independent Mapuches]] provoked a famine among Mapuches in the winter of 1869, with the situation being worsened by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224&gt;Bengoa 2000, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation led some Mapuches to sell their silver adornments in the towns of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]] to obtain food.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224/&gt;

As of 1984, Mapuche scholar Carlos Aldunate noted that there were no silversmiths alive among contemporary Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;

==Appearance==
Although these adornments showed some variation in form, the principal one appears to be a set of three separate columns of flattened silver links joined to each other by square alternating links.  At the top of the set of columns, and holding them together, is a flat two-headed bird figure and at the base is a flat semicircle or trapezoid that usually has a series of small disks dangling from its base.  The wearer would place the object hanging from his/ her neck and down the chest.

{{Views}}

In [[technical drawing]] and [[computer graphics]], a '''multiview projection''' is a technique of illustration by which a standardized series of [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] [[two-dimensional]] pictures is constructed to represent the form of a [[three-dimensional]] object. Up to six pictures of an object are produced (called ''primary views''), with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, ''usually'' three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. Other names for these views include ''plan'', ''elevation'' and ''section''.

The terms ''orthographic projection'' and ''orthogonal projection'' are sometimes reserved specifically for multiviews. However, ''orthographic'' and ''orthogonal'' more correctly refer to the [[right angle]] formed between the projection rays and the [[projection plane]], versus the angle formed between the ''subject of the drawing'' and the projection plane. Thus, orthographic projections include ''[[axonometric projection|axonometric]]'' or ''auxiliary views'' in addition to multiviews.

==Overview==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]], including ''elevation'' and ''plan'' views]]
To render each such picture, a ''[[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] of sight'' (also called a ''projection line'', ''projection ray'' or ''line of sight'') towards the object is chosen, which determines on the object various points of interest (for instance, the points that are visible when looking at the object along the ray of sight); those points of interest are mapped by an [[orthographic projection]] to points on some [[Plane (geometry)|geometric plane]] (called a ''[[projection plane]]'' or ''[[image plane]]'') that is perpendicular to the ray of sight, thereby creating a 2D representation of the 3D object.

Customarily, two rays of sight are chosen for each of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|three axes]] of the object's coordinate system; that is, parallel to each axis, the object may be viewed in one of 2 opposite directions, making for a total of 6 orthographic projections (or "views") of the object:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Ingrid Carlbom, Joseph Paciorek |title=Planar Geometric Projections and Viewing Transformations |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=465–502 |year=1978 |doi=10.1145/356744.356750}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Along the ''x''-axis: The ''left'' and ''right'' views, which are known as ''elevations'' (because they often show the features along the "vertical" length of an object such as a building).
* Along the ''y''-axis: The ''top'' and ''bottom'' views, which are known as ''plans'' (because they often show the features within a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross&amp;nbsp;section]] of the object, such as a floor in a building).
* Along the ''z''-axis: The ''front'' and ''back'' views, which are also known as ''elevations'', following the same reasoning.

These six planes of projection intersect each other, forming a box around the object, the most uniform construction of which is a cube; traditionally, these six views are presented together by first projecting the 3D object onto the 2D faces of a cube, and then "unfolding" the faces of the cube such that all of them are contained within the same plane (namely, the plane of the medium on which all of the images will be presented together, such as a piece of paper, or a computer monitor, etc.). However, even if the faces of the box are unfolded in one standardized way, there is ambiguity as to which projection is being displayed by a particular face; the cube has two faces that are perpendicular to a ray of sight, and the points of interest may be projected onto either one of them, a choice which has resulted in two predominant standards of projection:

# '''First-angle projection''': The points of interest are projected in the ''same'' direction as the ray of sight; the points are projected onto the plane that lies ''behind'' the object, as determined by the ray of sight; the plane of projection acts like the top of a table over which the points of interest are dropped into place.
# '''Third-angle projection''': The points of interest are projected in the ''opposite'' direction of the ray of sight; the points are projected onto the plane that lies ''in&amp;nbsp;front'' of the object, as determined by the ray of sight; the plane of projection acts like a glass table from under which the observer sees the points of interest after they have been dropped into place on the top of the table.

==Primary views==
Multiview projections show the ''primary views'' of an object, each viewed in a direction parallel to one of the main coordinate axes. These primary views are called ''plans'' and ''elevations''. Sometimes they are shown as if the object has been cut across or sectioned to expose the interior: these views are called ''sections''.

===Plan===
{{see also|Plan (drawing)|Floor plan}}
[[File:Millbank Prison Plan.jpg|thumb|right|A plan view of [[Millbank Prison]], 1828]]
A '''plan''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object seen from vertically above (or sometimes below). It may be drawn in the position of a horizontal plane passing through, above, or below the object. The outline of a shape in this view is sometimes called its ''planform'', for example with [[planform (aeronautics)|aircraft wings]].

The plan view from above a building is called its roof plan. A section seen in a horizontal plane through the walls and showing the floor beneath is called a ''floor plan''.

===Elevation===
[[File:Panthéon Soufflot - élevation principale.png|thumb|Principal façade of the [[Panthéon, Paris]], by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]].]]

An '''elevation''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a vertical plane beside an object. In other words, an elevation is a side-view as viewed from the front, back, left or right (and referred to as a ''front elevation'', ''[left/ right] side elevation'', and a ''rear elevation'').

An elevation is a common method of depicting the external configuration and detailing of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. Building façades are shown as elevations in [[architectural drawing]]s and [[technical drawing]]s.

Elevations are the most common orthographic projection for conveying the appearance of a building from the exterior. [[Perspective projection|Perspectives]] are also commonly used for this purpose. A building elevation is typically labeled in relation to the compass direction it faces; the direction from which a person views it. E.g. the North Elevation of a building is the side that most closely faces true north on the compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank| last = Ching | author-link = Frank Ching | title = Architectural Graphics - Second Edition | place = New York | publisher = Van Norstrand Reinhold | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-442-21862-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior elevations are used to show detailing such as [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] and trim configurations.

In the building industry elevations are a non-perspective view of the structure. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Drawing sets include front, rear and both side elevations. The elevations specify the composition of the different facades of the building, including ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches and other architectural details.

====Developed elevation====
A '''developed elevation''' is a variant of a regular elevation view in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together, as if they have been unfolded.  For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection.

===Section===
{{See also|Cross section (geometry)}}
A '''section''', or ''cross-section'', is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object.

A section is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions.  It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally [[crosshatch]]ed. The style of crosshatching often indicates the type of material the section passes through.

With [[computed axial tomography]], computers construct cross-sections from [[x-ray]] data.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Auxiliary views==
An ''auxiliary view'' or ''pictorial'', is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six ''primary views''.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These views are typically used when an object has a surface in an oblique plane. By projecting into a plane parallel with the oblique surface, the true size and shape of the surface is shown. Auxiliary views tend to make use of [[axonometric projection]].

===Quadrants in descriptive geometry===
[[File:Quadrants in descriptive geometry.png|thumb|200px|left|Gaspard Monge's four quadrants and two planes.]]
Modern orthographic projection is derived from [[Gaspard Monge]]'s [[descriptive geometry]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Monge defined a reference system of two viewing planes, horizontal ''H'' ("ground") and vertical ''V'' ("backdrop").  These two planes intersect to partition 3D space into 4 quadrants, which he labeled:
* ''I'': above ''H'', in front of ''V''
* ''II'': above ''H'', behind ''V''
* ''III'': below ''H'', behind ''V''
* ''IV'': below ''H'', in front of ''V''
These quadrant labels are the same as used in 2D planar geometry, as seen from infinitely far to the "left", taking ''H'' and ''V'' to be the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis, respectively.

The 3D object of interest is then placed into either quadrant ''I'' or ''III'' (equivalently, the position of the intersection line between the two planes is shifted), obtaining ''first''- and ''third-angle'' projections, respectively.  Quadrants ''II'' and ''IV'' are also mathematically valid, but their use would result in one view "true" and the other view "flipped" by 180° through its vertical centerline, which is too confusing for technical drawings. (In cases where such a view is useful, e.g. a ceiling viewed from above, a reflected view is used, which is a mirror image of the true orthographic view.)

Monge's original formulation uses two planes only, and obtains the top and front views only.  The addition of a third plane to show a [[Elevation (view)|side view]] (either left or right) is a modern extension.  The terminology of ''quadrant'' is a mild anachronism, as a modern orthographic projection with three views corresponds more precisely to an octant of 3D space.
'''

===First-angle projection===
In '''first-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant '''I''', i.e. it '''floats above and before''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''opaque''', and each view is '''pushed''' through the object onto the plane furthest from it.  (Mnemonic: an "actor on a stage".)  Extending to the 6-sided box, each view of the object is projected in the direction (sense) of sight of the object, onto the (opaque) interior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the opposite side of the box. A two-dimensional representation of the object is then created by "unfolding" the box, to view all of the '''interior''' walls. This produces two [[plan]]s and four [[elevation]]s. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the
object on top of an upside-down bowl. Sliding the object down the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
'''

===Third-angle projection===

[[File:Orthographic example.gif|thumb|An example of a multiview orthographic drawing from a US Patent (1913), showing two views of the same object. Third angle projection is used.]]
In '''third-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant III, i.e. it is positioned '''below and behind''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''transparent''', and each view is '''pulled''' onto the plane closest to it.  (Mnemonic: a "shark in a tank", esp. that is sunken into the floor.)  Using the 6-sided viewing box, each view of the object is projected opposite to the direction (sense) of sight, onto the (transparent) exterior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the same side of the box.  The box is then unfolded to view all of its '''exterior''' walls. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object in the bottom of a bowl. Sliding the object up the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.

Here is the construction of third angle projections of the same object as above.  Note that the individual views are the same, just arranged differently.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Additional information===

First-angle projection is as if the object were sitting '''on''' the paper and, from
the "face" (front) view, it is rolled to the right to show the left side or rolled up to show its bottom. It is standard throughout Europe and Asia (excluding Japan).  First-angle projection was widely used in the UK, but during World War II, British drawings sent to be manufactured in the USA, such as of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]], had to be drawn in third-angle projection before they could be produced, e.g., as the [[Packard V-1650 Merlin]]. This historical position of the UK means that some British companies completely adopted third angle projection. BS 308 (Part 1) Engineering Drawing Practice, gave the option of using both projections, but generally every illustration (other than the ones explaining the difference between first and third-angle) was done in first-angle. After the withdrawal of BS 308 in 1999, BS 8888 offered the same choice since it referred directly to ISO 5456-2, Technical drawings – Projection methods – Part 2: Orthographic representations.

Third-angle is as if the object were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is in the center of the two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the left view is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is standard in the USA ([[the American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.

Both first-angle and third-angle projections result in the same 6 views; the difference between them is the arrangement of these views around the box.

A great deal of confusion has ensued in drafting rooms and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another.  On [[engineering drawing]]s, the projection angle is denoted by an international symbol consisting of a truncated [[cone (geometry)|cone]], respectively for first-angle and third-angle:

http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/orthographic_projection_fyp/images/projection_symbols.png

[[File:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either First Angle (left) or Third Angle (right)]]

The 3D interpretation of the symbol can be deduced by envisioning a solid truncated cone, standing upright with its large end on the floor and the small end upward.  The top view is therefore two concentric circles ("donut"). In particular, the fact that the inner circle is drawn with a solid line instead of dashed identifies this view as the top view, not the bottom view.
* In ''first-angle projection'', the "top" view is pushed down to the floor, and the "front" view is pushed back to the rear wall; the intersection line between these two planes is therefore closest to the large end of the cone, hence the first-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end open toward the donut.
* In ''third-angle projection'', the "top" view is pulled up to the ceiling, and the "front" view is pulled forward to the front wall; the intersection line between the two planes is thus closest to the small end of the cone, hence the third-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end away from the donut.

==Multiviews without rotation==

Orthographic multiview projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]] and may produce an image of a specified, imaginary object as viewed from any direction of space. Orthographic projection is distinguished by parallel projectors emanating from all points of the imaged object and which intersect of projection at right angles. Above, a technique is described that obtains varying views by projecting images after the object is rotated to a desired position.

Descriptive geometry customarily relies on obtaining various views by imagining an object to be stationary, and changing the direction of projection (viewing) in order to obtain the desired view.

See ''Figure 1''. Using the rotation technique above, note that no orthographic view is available looking perpendicularly at any of the inclined surfaces. Suppose a technician desired such a view to, say, look through a hole to be drilled perpendicularly to the surface. Such a view might be desired for calculating clearances or for dimensioning purposes. To obtain this view without multiple rotations requires the principles of Descriptive Geometry. The steps below describe the use of these principles in third angle projection.

==Territorial use==
First-angle is used in most of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.ul.ie/~rynnet/orthographic_projection_fyp/webpages/third_angle.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-angle projection is most commonly used in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spdxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=asme+y14.3&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y-LDefoeGq&amp;sig=6eEmEixLZMufehl3MD2gSdoGVes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyls65nPPKAhVDuRQKHSCzCP84FBDoAQgeMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=asme+y14.3&amp;f=false|title=Engineering Drawing and Design|first1=David A.|last1=Madsen|first2=David P.|last2=Madsen|date=1 February 2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan (in JIS B 0001：2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-design-glossary.musabi.ac.jp/third-angle-projection/|publisher=[[Musashino Art University]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|title=Third Angle Projection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is preferred in Australia, as laid down in [[AS 1100]].101—1992 6.3.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/AS1100.1011992TechnicalDwgs/AS1100.101-1992+Technical+Dwgs_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "AS 1100.101 1992 Technical Dwgs"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''Nadigar Sangam''' ({{lang-en|Actors' association}}), officially known as the '''South Indian Artistes' Association''' ('''SIAA'''), is a [[Trade union|union]] for [[film]], [[television]], and [[stage (theatre)|stage]] actors in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], based in [[Chennai]]. Formed in 1952, the group has a charitable trust fund to provide pensions to retired actors, voice support for actors caught in controversy, and have collectively protested socio-political issues.

Elections in the Nadigar Sangam, which is made up of over 3000 members, are held once every three years to determine the president of the group.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-nadigar-sangam-battle/article7711910.ece |title=All you need to know about the Nadigar Sangam battle |work=The Hindu |date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. Sarathkumar]], who had been elected unopposed three times since 2006 when former president [[Vijayakanth]] stepped down, was ousted after an election on 18 October 2015 by [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]].

==History==

===Formation and early history===
Film director [[Krishnaswami Subrahmanyam|K. Subrahmanyam]], who had helped Sri Sathyamurthy start the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, was approached by actors R. M. Somasundaram, T. N. Sivathanu, N. N. Kannappa and Sattampillai Venkatraman to create a representative organization in [[Tamil Nadu]] for professional actors from [[Cinema of South India|South Indian cinema]], since many filming studios of Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada cinema industries were also based in Madras (now [[Chennai]]) at the time. Subsequently in August 1952, they launched the Junior Actors Association (Thunai Nadigar Sangam) for junior artistes. Thereafter, [[M. G. Ramachandran]] expressed his desire to join this group and insisted that there should be no difference amongst actors on the basis of seniority, and hence, it came to be called the Nadigar Sangam. As films from all the four southern languages were shot in [[Madras]] during that period, it was later renamed Thenn Indhiya Nadigar Sangam (South Indian Artistes Association). On 15 November 1952, it was registered as a society with rules and bylaws in place. K. Subrahmanyam and MGR donated money to help run this association, and began recruiting members. The founder-president was T. V. Sundaram, while the vice-presidents were MGR, [[S. D. Subbulakshmi]], S. D. Sundaram and K. Vembu. The secretaries were T. N. Sivathanu and R. M. Somasundaram, while R. S. Manohar was appointed as the treasurer. The first member on its rolls, as of 1955, was N. N. Kannappa, and the next was M. R. Santhanam.&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/a-brief-history-of-nadigar-sangam/article7877460.ece?secpage=true&amp;secname=entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1955, a magazine, Nadigan Kural (The Voice of the Artiste) was started by MGR, who served as its first editor.

Over the following years, the society began to function and in February 1954, the first elections were held. The Sanga, organized railway concessions for drama artistes and paved the way for the introduction of bus services to the [[Kodambakkam]] studios, through the bus, 12B (Santhome to Kodambakkam) in 1955. A fund-raiser for cyclone relief was organized in December 1955 and at the event, plays and light music performances were organized.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

The team purchased over {{convert|2000|sqft|m2}} of land on Habibulla Road in [[T Nagar]], an affluent neighborhood in Madras (now [[Chennai]]). Upon Ramachandran's appointment as [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu]] in 1977, he approved the Nadigar Sangam's construction of a new building, comprising a preview theatre, a gym and an office space.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-status-quo-at-nadigar-sangam/article7720739.ece |title=No status quo at Nadigar Sangam |work=The Hindu |date=4 October 2015 |author=Udhav Naig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently upon opening of the Sankardas Swamigal auditorium, Sivaji Ganesan became its president and Major Sunderrajan, its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/the-major-effect/article7586580.ece|title=The 'Major' impact|author=Suganthy Krishnamachari|work=The Hindu|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By generating income through the building, Sivaji administered regular payment to poor artistes in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilguardian.com/tg119/p8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 1987, a public charitable trust called the ''Nadigar Sangam Charitable Trust'' was registered, with founders of the trust being [[R. S. Manohar]], [[N. S. Krishnan]], and [[Radha Ravi]]. The trust was established to provide educational, medical and other forms of monetary assistance to needy members of the Nadigar Sangam.&lt;ref name="judis.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judis.nic.in/judis_chennai/qrydisp.aspx?filename=40111|title=Untitled Page|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt, fundraising events and protests===

During the late 1990s, pressure began to grow on incumbent leader [[Radharavi]] after allegations of financial wrongdoing. In October 1997, the film industry had a protest against the leadership.&lt;ref name="indolink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/97/Oct/strike.htm|title=Strike Page|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vijayakanth]] was elected unopposed as the President of the Nadigar Sangam in August 2000, while [[R. Sarathkumar]] was appointed as the General Secretary. Although members had called for a new committee to replace the existing group, several experienced members stayed on in roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilmovies.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=8-00|title=Tamil Movies Online ::::: News|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijayakanth's initial task was to clear up debt totalling over {{INR}}2 crore. Vijayakanth retained presidency of the Nadigar Sangam after defeating Devi by 972 to 124 votes in December 2002. Sarathkumar continued as the General Secretary, while [[Napolean (actor)|Napolean]], Radharavi and [[S. S. Chandran]] were made Vice Presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/vijaykanth-re-elected-news-tamil-kkfv90ajhfdsi.html|title=Vijaykanth re-elected!|work=Sify|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijayakanth organized "Star Night" stage shows in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] to fundraise for the Nadigar Sangam's accumulated debt, which was at approximately {{INR}}4.5 [[crore]].&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; Later on in the year, the Sangam staged a 5000 people-strong an anti-Karnataka demonstration in Neyveli, demanding stoppage of power supply to that state, as a result of the [[Kaveri River water dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/oct/12cau4.htm|title=rediff.com: Tamil film artistes stage anti-Karnataka rally in Neyveli|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 2004, another star show was conducted in [[Dubai]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] for fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sify.com/movies/another-star-show-in-dubai-news-tamil-kkfvHiieefbsi.html Dubai &amp; Abu Dhabi star shows for fundraising to build 7-storey structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of his political party [[Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam]], Vijayakanth opted to stand down as the President of the Nadigar Sangam and called for elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/06/13/stories/2005061302220400.htm|title=The Hindu : Tamil Nadu News : Industry wants Vijaykant to stay put|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/khel/fullstory.php?id=14224794|title=Who will be the new chief?|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Sarathkumar]] and [[Napolean (actor)|Napolean]] were expected to run for presidency, but following his loss at the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 2006|2006 state elections]], the latter pulled out.&lt;ref name="behindwoods.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-02/05-06-06-nadigar-sangam.html|title=Tamil movies : Nadigar Sangam Elections: Action scenes awaited?|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] and [[Nassar]] had also considered running for the presidential post, but opted against doing so.&lt;ref name="hind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sarath-kumar-elected-unopposed-to-top-post/article3113088.ece|title=Sarath Kumar elected unopposed to top post|work=The Hindu|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Sarathkumar was elected unopposed, while [[Radharavi]] was elected as General Secretary and [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] and [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as vice-presidents.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/battle-for-kollywood-nadigar-sangam-elections/article7668627.ece |title=Battle for Kollywood |work=The Hindu |author=Sreedhar Pillai |date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the group organized a one-day hunger strike opposing the [[Karnataka]] government's [[Hogenakkal water dispute|controversial plan]] of the [[Hogenakkal Integrated Drinking Water Project]] and the abuse of Tamils in the state of [[Karnataka]]. In September 2008, Sarathkumar called for a one-day hunger strike, protesting the deaths of several Tamils in [[Sri Lanka]] and the ongoing [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. It was among the first of a series of [[protests against the Sri Lankan Civil War]] that occurred the following year across the world. Sarathkumar was elected unopposed in June 2009, with [[Vagai Chandrasekhar]] joining the incumbent team as a treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;http://tamilwire.net/21778-sarath-kumar-elected-nadigar-sangam.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2009, Sarathkumar launched a rally against the [[Tamil Nadu]]-based newspaper ''[[Dina Malar]]'' for publishing a news article claiming Indian pornographic actress Bhuvaneshwari had exposed several Tamil actresses involved in illegal sex-work. The actresses listed in the newspaper, with their photos, were [[Namitha]], Seetha, Nalini, Anju, [[Shakeela]], [[Manjula Vijayakumar]] and [[Sripriya]]. General secretary [[Radha Ravi]] filed a defamation complaint to Chennai Police, resulting in the arrest of the newspaper's editor [[B. Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Dinamalar-news-editor-arrested-for-defaming-actors/articleshow/5099586.cms |title=Dinamalar news editor arrested for defaming actors |work=The Times of India |date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists, including ''[[The Hindu]]'' editor [[N. Ram]], condemned Lenin's arrest as only being done to appease film stars and demanded his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/journalist-forums-condemn-arrest-of-dinamalar-news-editor/article31055.ece | title=Journalist forums condemn arrest of Dinamalar News Editor | publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=9 October 2009 | accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin was later released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/chennai-bail-for-news-editor-in-harassment-case-402887 | title=Chennai: Bail for news editor in harassment case | publisher=[[NDTV]] | date=9 October 2009 | accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article137104.ece | title=Dinamalar journalist gets bail | publisher=[[New Indian Express]] | date=9 October 2009 | accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sarathkumar and his wife [[Raadhika]], who were respectively the star and co-producer of the film ''[[Jaggubhai]]'', held a press conference condemning the act of giving films unauthorized distribution on the Internet, after it was discovered that an unedited full-length version of the film had been uploaded online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/53274.html |title=SarathRadhika in tears: Stars support |work=IndiaGlitz |date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building controversy and 2015 election===

In 2010, the Nadigar Sangam announced the idea to demolish its existing building in [[T. Nagar]], [[Chennai]] and construct a new one. On 6 August 2010, [[Radha Ravi]] allowed a long-term lease of the land, which was approximately 18 grounds and worth {{INR}}150 [[crore]] at the time, to [[R. Sarathkumar]]. A 29-year, 11-month land lease agreement was signed by Sarathkumar on 25 November 2010 to [[SPI Cinemas|Sathyam Cinemas]] (now known as SPI Cinemas), who planned commercial developments, including a multiplex and office space.&lt;ref name="judis.nic.in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadigar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-nadigar-sangam-battle/article7711910.ece | title=All you need to know about the Nadigar Sangam battle | publisher=The Hindu | date=17 October 2015 | accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.deccanchronicle.com/121123/entertainment-kollywood/article/%E2%80%98i-will-come-clean%E2%80%99 |title=I will come clean |work=Deccan Chronicle |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the building began in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/nadigar-sangam-building-demolished-10-days-20110310-055050-663.html|title=Nadigar Sangam building to be demolished in 10 days|date=10 March 2011|work=Yahoo News India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarathkumar was elected unopposed for a third consecutive term in June 2012. Radharavi, [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] and [[Vagai Chandrasekhar]] continued as General Secretary, Vice President and Treasurer respectively, while K. N. Kaalai replaced [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] as a Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollyinsider.com/2012/06/sarath-kumar-as-nadigar-sangam.html|title=Sarath Kumar as Nadigar Sangam President for third consecutive|work=Tamil Cinema News - Movie Reviews - Gossips|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 2012, a case was filed at the [[Madras High Court]] by film actor Poochi Murugan and P. A. Kaja Mohideen against Sarathkumar and Ravi to stop the land lease to SPI Cinemas. Murugan alleged that the initial leasing of land by Ravi was done illegally and unilaterally without consulting the nine-member board of trustees or seeking approval from the rest of the association before deciding to lease. Murugan also claimed that the land rent set for SPI Cinemas was far less than market value and alleged that both Sarathkumar and Ravi were involved in a [[conflict of interest]] due to the fact that the two were brothers-in-law, accusing them of trying to take full control of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/HC-All-is-not-well-with-actors-body/articleshow/16817435.cms|title=HC: All is not well with actors’ body|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a few members including [[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]] and [[Nassar]] questioned the intent behind demolishing the building and leasing the land to a private company. Sarathkumar justified his acts claiming that leasing the land would generate income for the association, which would be used to assist members in need. Vishal insisted that the lease to SPI Cinemas be cancelled and that the association should construct its own building. Comedy actor [[Kumarimuthu]] was expelled from the Nadigar Sangam over allegations of speaking negatively about the association, after he questioned the intent behind the land lease and building demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Kumari-Muthu-expelled-from-Nadigar-Sangam/articleshow/19930781.cms|title=Kumari Muthu expelled from Nadigar Sangam|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Vishal submitted a complaint against Radha Ravi and Kaalai, who both remarked that anyone speaking out against Sarathkumar are dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Calling-actors-as-DOGS-hurts-Vishal/articleshow/45213625.cms|title=Calling actors as 'DOGS' hurts: Vishal|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishal alleged that leasing the land to construct a multiplex was money-motivated.&lt;ref name="movies.ndtv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/sarath-kumar-warns-actor-vishal-over-derogatory-remarks-701551|title=Sarath Kumar Warns Actor Vishal Over Derogatory Remarks|work=NDTVMovies.com|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarathkumar later accused Vishal of stating negative remarks about the Nadigar Sangam and that the association "will take action against him and he may also be removed from the Nadigar Sangam" which Vishal later denied and stated, "Questioning why the construction of the building hasn't started yet is not wrong according to me, and I will continue to do that. I just want all younger actors to join this good cause, and that too, I had clearly said, 'under the leadership of Sarathkumar only'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Vishal-hits-back-at-Sarath-Kumar/articleshow/45218540.cms|title=Vishal hits back at Sarath Kumar|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Vishal announced his intention to contest in the upcoming elections with a team against Sarathkumar if the lease agreement to SPI Cinemas was not retracted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cineulagam.com/tamil/news/cinema/vishal-to-contest-nadigar-sangam-elections/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarathkumar was backed by Radha Ravi, who was seeking another term for secretary. Along with the two were S. S. R. Kannan who contested for treasurer, while [[Silambarasan]] and [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] ran for vice presidents. Their opposition, collectively named the Pandavar team after the [[Pandava]] from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', was led by  Vishal running for secretary, Nassar running for president, [[Karthi]] running for treasurer, and both [[Karunas]] and [[Ponvannan]] running for vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tamilglitz.in/nadigar-sangam-election-nominees-full-list/ | title=Nadigar Sangam :nominess Full List | date=9 October 2015 | accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally set for 15 June 2015, the election was issued an interim stay by the Madras High Court and pushed to 18 October 2015 after members of the Pandavar team requested that the election venue should be held at a private location with a former chief of justice observing the election process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Nadigar-Sangam-election-dates-announced/articleshow/48867892.cms|title=Nadigar Sangam election dates announced|work=The Times of India|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between June and October 2015, both teams campaigned vehemently against each other across Tamil Nadu and encouraged actors to vote.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">[[File:Ephesus odeon.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Ephesus]] Odeon, [[Turkey]]]]
'''Odeon''' is the name for several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings built for music: singing exercises, musical shows, poetry competitions, and the like. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ᾨδεῖον, ''Ōideion'', literally "singing place", or "building for musical competitions"; from the verb ἀείδω, ''aeidō'', "I sing", which is also the root of ᾠδή, ''ōidē'',  "[[ode]]", and of ἀοιδός, ''[[aoidos]]'', "singer".

==Description==
In a general way the construction of an odeon was similar to that of an [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]], but it was only a quarter of the size and was provided with a [[roof]] for [[acoustics|acoustic]] purposes, a characteristic difference. The prototype odeon was the Odeon of [[Pericles]] ([[Odeon of Athens]]), a mainly wooden building by the southern slope of the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. It was described by Plutarch as 'many-seated and many-columned' and may have been square, though excavations have also suggested a different shape, 208 x 62 feet. It was said to be decorated  with the masts and spars of ships captured from the Persians. It was rebuilt by king [[Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia]] after destruction by fire in the [[First Mithridatic War]] in 87–86 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher=OUP|page=617|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[File:Troy Troia Truva 1280866 1280910 Nevit 45 images.jpg|thumbnail|Hadrianic Odeon in Troy IX]]

The oldest known odeon in Greece was the Skias at [[Sparta]], so called from its resemblance to the top of a [[parasol]], said to have been erected by [[Theodorus of Samos]] (600 B.C.); in Athens an odeon near the spring Enneacrunus on the [[Ilissus]] was referred to the age of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], and appears to have been rebuilt or restored by [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] (c. 330 B.C.). This is probably the building which, according to [[Aristophanes]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'', 1109.&lt;/ref&gt; was used for judicial purposes, for the distribution of corn, and even for the billeting of soldiers.

[[File:Odeon-lyon.jpg|thumb|[[Odeon of Lyon|Odeon of Fourvière]], [[Lyon]], France]]
The most magnificent odeon was the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] on the southwest cliff of the Acropolis at Athens. It was built in about 160 A.D. by the wealthy sophist and rhetorician [[Herodes Atticus]] in memory of his wife, and considerable remains of the odeon still exist. It had accommodation for 4500/5500 persons, and the ceiling was constructed of beautifully carved beams of cedar wood, probably with an open space in the centre to admit the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also profusely decorated with pictures and other works of art. Similar buildings also existed in other parts of Greece; at [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], also the gift of Herodes Atticus;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Patrae]], where there was a famous statue of [[Apollo]]; at [[Smyrna]], [[Tralles]], and other towns in [[Asia Minor]]. The first odeon in Rome was built by Domitian ([[Odeon of Domitian]]), a second by Trajan.

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 115 inner wings.jpg|189px|thumb|right|This is diptych known as ''Paradise and Hell''.]]

'''''Paradise and Hell''''' is the left and right panels of a minor [[diptych]] by a follower of [[Hieronymus Bosch]] based on ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''. The image is oil on panel and is 135 x 45&amp;nbsp;cm. It was painted c. 1510 and is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]. Paradise is depicted darker than in the Haywain, which possibly represents the darkness of [[original sin]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Description==
The left panel depicts Creation and the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is loosely divided into sections, beginning at the top and ending at the bottom, while the right panel does not appear to follow any sequence of events. The left panel most likely corresponds with the Book of Genesis, and follows from the top, moving downward, and the right panel possibly corresponds with the [[Book of Revelation]]. At the top of the left panel, [[God]] sits enthroned in [[Heaven]] while the world is created. [[Angel]]s toss the [[fallen angel]]s out of the Heaven. While the fallen angels are thrown out of Heaven, they turn to insects. Moving downward, in the next 'section', a scene is shown where God has created [[Eve]] and is introducing her to [[Adam]]. In the third 'section', the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] offers Adam and Eve a fruit from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], and Adam is reaching out to take it. At the bottom of the panel, an angel expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, thus marking the Fall of Man, and the two become ashamed of their nakedness. The right panel depicts the consequences of Adam and Eve's choice, in which a vision of hell is shown. A burning building can be seen in the background, and in the foreground, there appear to be several demons constructing a fortress or castle. To the lower left, a man is being directed towards a castle by two mutated animals. Just in front of the portcullis is a man riding a cow, being pierced by a sword or spear. At the bottom right, a man is running while being attacked by demonic creatures, while to the lower left a man is being devoured by a large human-legged fish.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''preceptor''' (Turkic-Persian Ataaleeq) is a teacher responsible to uphold a certain law or tradition, a ''[[precept]]''.

==Christian military orders==
A preceptor was historically in charge of a preceptory, the headquarters of certain orders of monastic knights, such as the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Knights Templar]], within a given geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Zsolt Hunyadi, József Laszlovszky, ''The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity'' (Budapest, 2001), pp. 235, 270&lt;/ref&gt; The preceptor had supreme control of his brethren and was only answerable to the [[Grand Master (order)|grand master]] of his particular order. A preceptory's main focus would be its church and accommodation for the brethren.

Examples include the Hospitaller [[Torphichen Preceptory]] in [[West Lothian]], [[Scotland]]; [[West Peckham Preceptory]] in [[West Peckham]], [[England]] and the Templar [[Aslackby Preceptory]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[Keele Preceptory]] in [[Staffordshire]] and [[Temple, Midlothian]].

==Freemasonry==
Within modern-day [[Freemasonry]] the preceptor is the head of a lodge of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Edward Waite, ''A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry'', Volume 1 (New York: Cosimo, 2007), p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lodges operate within a geographical area and provide training in the performance of the order's ritual for members of the order.  The preceptor is an elected position and is usually a Freemason who has spent several years as a director of ceremonies in his local lodge and is considered an expert in the ritual of the order.

In English Freemasonry, the Preceptor of the lodge is usually appointed by the Master. His main responsibility is to prompt those masons who have forgotten their words. Some lodges, and some preceptors, take his theoretical status as a teacher more seriously than others.

==Music==
Musically, the title preceptor usually refers to a monk responsible for making music in a [[monastery]]. He trained the monks in the traditions of plainchant for daily services and prayers.

==Education==
Some North American universities have a special student position called preceptor. Preceptors are student volunteers who assist the staff professor and teaching assistants of a large lecture class by helping design certain lessons and holding his or her own office hours and review sessions. In some cases, volunteers are required to take an outside class focused on leadership development, where the final grade is determined by both the lecture professor and leadership development teacher. Thus, the preceptor earns credit for his or her preceptorship. It is considered a good leadership experience and reflects well on the student in his or her transcript. Preceptor can also refer to a paid student grader.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

At some universities, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]], "preceptors" are not students at all but faculty members teaching courses in [[writing]], [[music]], [[mathematics]], [[languages]], and the [[life sciences]]. In some departments they are not tenured faculty but rather non-ladder faculty (generally PhDs) who help administer and run the course, especially with the larger ones. Harvard preceptors, who teach introductory writing, have included ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' staff writer [[George Packer]], novelist [[Tom Perrotta]], former ''[[The Boston Globe|Globe]]'' music critic [[Richard Dyer]] and poet [[Dan Chiasson]].{{cn|date=February 2016}} At [[Columbia University]], on the other hand, "preceptors" are senior graduate students who, along with senior faculty, teach courses on "Literature Humanities" and "Contemporary Civilization". The title is also used to refer to [[teaching assistant]]s at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], who are typically [[graduate student]]s.

At [[Elon University School of Law]], a preceptor is an attorney who mentors two or three first-year law students.

==Health==
In [[medical education|medicine]], [[allied health]], midwifery, paramedicine, pharmacy and [[nursing]] education, a preceptor is a skilled practitioner or faculty member who supervises students in a clinical setting to allow practical experience with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Myrick, Olive Yonge, ''Nursing Preceptorship: Connecting Practice and Education'' (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mercer |first1=C |title=Family medicine faces shortage of doctors willing to teach. |journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; journal de l'Association medicale canadienne |date=28 May 2018 |volume=190 |issue=21 |pages=E666 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-5604 |pmid=29807944 |pmc=5973894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri Rousseau - Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''In a Tropical Forest Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo'', 1908-1909, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

[[File:Pusharo.jpg|thumb|Detail of Pusharo petroglyphs]]
The '''Petroglyphs of Pusharo''' constitute a unique and extensive ancient rock art site in southeast [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]], a [[jungle]]d expanse that still contains unexplored and little known areas, and for which an official government permit is required for entry.

==Discovery==
It appears that a rubber tapper on an Indian raid in 1909 may have been the first non-native to encounter the petroglyphs, with the next visit having been made by a Dominican missionary, Vicente Cenitagoya, in 1921.  A smattering of adventurers began to arrive at the site in the 1950s, and in 1969 the site was visited by the Peruvian physician/explorer Dr. [[Carlos Neuenschwander Landa]] (who would return in later years accompanied by Peruvian explorer, Sr. Santiago Yábar). In 1970 another peripatetic Dominican, Padre Adolfo Torrealba, reached the site, followed by Japanese explorer Yoshiharo Sekino, and the French-Peruvian explorers Herbert and Nicole Cartagena in 1978.  Two years later came the Peruvian archaeologist [[Federico Kauffmann Doig]]. In 1991 the party of North American explorer [[Gregory Deyermenjian]], including Peruvian explorer Paulino Mamani and the previously mentioned Santiago Yábar, arrived at Pusharo.  The site has since been visited and studied by rock art scholar Rainer Hostnig.

In 2008, it was the subject of a documentary-trek filmed for the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Extreme Dreams With Ben Fogle|Extreme Dreams]]'' presented by [[Ben Fogle]].

==Description==
The site is made up of an array of deeply incised rock carvings that cover up to a height of 9 feet, a perpendicular rock face that is over 100 feet long and 75 feet high.  Its location is on the south shore of the [[Río Palatoa]] (designated on some maps at this location as the Porotoa, and known by others as the [[Palatoa Chico]]).  The [[petroglyphs]] are thought by some researchers to be purely pan-Amazonian in origin, and of mistico-religious or shamanic significance to those Amerindians of past centuries who must have been their creators.  Others believe that there is an Incan component that is now coming to light, and that the glyphs constitute parts of a map.  Definitive word on the meaning of Pusharo's glyphs must wait until further research is conducted and completed.  The glyphs contain elements such as heart-shaped faces, some with double borders, spirals, zigzags, suns, "curlicue X's" and others that defy verbal description.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">{{Wittgenstein|Works}}
'''Remarks on Colour''' ({{lang-de|Bemerkungen über die Farben}}) was one of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s last works, written during a visit to [[Vienna]] in 1950 while dying of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/ghcc/research/global-arts/workshops/materialculture/a218.4finlay.pdf "Weaving the Rainbow: Visions of Color in World History"] by Robert Finlay, [[University of Arkansas]], at warwick.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that philosophical puzzles about colour can only be resolved through attention to the involved [[language-games]], he considers [[Goethe]]'s propositions in the ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]'', and the observations of [[Philipp Otto Runge]] in an attempt to clarify the use of language about colour.&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGinn | first1 = M. | title = Wittgenstein's ''Remarks on Colour'' | journal = [[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] | volume = 66 | issue = 258| pages = 435–453 | date=October 1991 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065104| jstor = 3751218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Goethe's theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory, rather it really isn't a theory at all. Nothing can be predicted with it. It is, rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in [[William James|James]]'s psychology. Nor is there any ''[[experimentum crucis]]'' which could decide for or against the theory. Someone who agrees with Goethe believes that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour. And nature here is not what results from experiments, but it lies in the concept of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ludwig |last1=Wittgenstein |author-link=Ludwig Wittgenstein |title=Remarks on Colour |publisher=University of California Press |editor=[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] |year=1977|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori, but something in between: phenomenology, according to Goethe. However, he took the line that 'There is no such thing as phenomenology, though there are phenomenological problems.' He was content to regard Goethe's observations as a kind of logic or geometry. Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the "Farbenlehre", e.g. "White is the lightest colour", "There cannot be a transparent white", "There cannot be a reddish green", and so on. The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein's investigation, including their relation to physics, was discussed in [[Jonathan Westphal]]'s ''Colour: a Philosophical Introduction'' (1991).

{{cquote|There seem to be propositions that have the character of experiential propositions, but whose truth is for me unassailable.. There are, in any case, errors.. which must be set apart from the rest of my judgements as temporary confusions. But aren't there transitional cases between these two. If we introduce the concept of knowing into this investigation, it will be of no help; because knowing is not a psychological state whose special characteristics explain all kinds of things. On the contrary, the special logic of the concept 'knowing' is not that of a psychological state. (Wittgenstein, pp. III.348-350)}}

Although ''Remarks on Colour'' is considered difficult on account of its fragmentation,&lt;ref name="McGinn 1991"/&gt; his last work, ''[[On Certainty]]'' (German: Über Gewissheit) is considered to be his most lucid.

{{One source|date=April 2018}}
A '''screen test''' is a method of determining the suitability of an [[actor]] or [[actress]] for performing on [[film]] or in a particular role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/screen+test|title=Definition of SCREEN TEST|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight ("cold reading"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.

==Types==
Screen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of [[costume]], [[make-up]] and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films.

International actors such as [[Bruce Lee]] were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee's case, for the role of Kato in ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', he was asked to converse about [[Chinese culture]] in [[English language|English]] to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some [[martial arts]] moves to show off his physical skills.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A '''songwriter''' is a professional that writes [[lyrics]] or [[musical compositions]] for [[song]]s. A songwriter can also be called a [[composer]], although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the [[classical music]] genre and Film Scoring. The pressure from the [[music industry]] to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people.&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt; For example, a songwriter who excels at [[Lyricist|writing lyrics]] might be paired with a songwriter with the task of creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers – songwriters directly employed by [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s.&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt; Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt;

The old-style apprenticeship approach to learning how to write songs is being supplemented by [[Bachelor of music|university degrees]] and college diplomas and "rock schools".&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt; Knowledge of modern music technology (sequencers, synthesizers, computer sound editing), songwriting elements and business skills are now often necessary requirements for a songwriter. Several music colleges offer songwriting diplomas and degrees with music business modules.&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt; Since songwriting and publishing [[royalty payment|royalties]] can be substantial sources of income, particularly if a song becomes a [[hit record]], legally, in the US, songs written after 1934 may be copied only by the authors. The legal power to grant these permissions may be bought, sold or transferred. This is governed by international [[copyrights|copyright law]].&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt;

Songwriters can be employed to write either the lyrics or the music directly for or alongside a performing artist, or they present songs to [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]], publishers, agents and managers for consideration. Song pitching can be done on a songwriter's behalf by their publisher or independently using [[tip sheet]]s like ''RowFax'', the ''[[MusicRow]]'' publication and ''[[SongQuarters]]''.&lt;ref name="emusician"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/ |title=How to pitch your songs to industry insiders. |publisher=EMusician |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724185818/http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/# |archive-date=2010-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skills associated with song-writing include entrepreneurism and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;The quaternary entrepreneur, Gian Paolo Prandstraller - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff writers==

Songwriters who sign an exclusive songwriting agreement with a publisher are called ''staff writers''. Being a staff writer effectively means that, during the term of the songwriter's contract with the publisher, all their songs are automatically published by that company and cannot be published elsewhere.&lt;ref name="emusician"/&gt;

In the Nashville country music scene, there is a strong staff writer culture where contracted writers work normal "9-to-5" hours at the publishing office and are paid a regular salary. This salary is in effect the writer's "draw", an advance on future earnings, which is paid on a monthly basis and enables them to live within a fixed budget.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Roger_Murrah_Interview.html |title=Interview with Roger Murrah |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher owns the copyright of songs written during the term of the agreement for a designated period, after which the songwriter can reclaim the copyright.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt; In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], songwriter [[Dave Berg (songwriter)|Dave Berg]] extolled the benefits of the set-up: "I was able to concentrate on writing the whole time and have always had enough money to live on."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Dave_Berg_Interview.html |title=Interview with Dave Berg |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike contracted writers, some staff writers operate as employees for their respective publishers. Under the terms of these 
[[work for hire]] agreements, the compositions created are fully owned by the publisher. Because the recapture provision of the [[United States]] [[Copyright Act of 1976]] does not apply to "works made for hire," the rights to a song created under an employment contract cannot be "recaptured" by the writer after 35 years. In Nashville, young writers are often, strongly encouraged to avoid these types of contracts.

Staff writers are common across the whole industry, but without the more office-like working arrangements favored in Nashville. All the major publishers employ writers under contract.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Obtaining a staff writer contract with a publisher can be a first step for any professional songwriting career, with some writers with a desire for greater independence outgrowing this set-up once they achieve a degree of success.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Songwriter [[Allan Eshuijs]] described his staff writer contract at [[Universal Music Publishing]] as a starter deal. His success under the arrangement eventually allowed him to found his own publishing company, so that he could "...keep as much [publishing income] as possible and say how it's going to be done."&lt;ref name="Allan Eshuijs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Allan_Eshuijs_Interview.html |title=Interview with Allan Eshuijs |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As musicians==
Songwriters are also often skilled musicians. In part, this is because the process of "working out" a song or arrangement requires a songwriter to play an instrument, typically the [[guitar]] or the [[piano]], to hear how the [[chord progression]] sounds and to hear how well a given set of chords supports a melody. In addition to selling their songs and musical concepts for other artists to sing, some songwriter-musicians create songs to perform themselves. Songwriters need to create a number of elements for a song. At minimum, a songwriter must prepare a [[lead sheet]] for a song, which consists of one or more pieces of [[music notation|sheet music]] with the melody notes and [[chord progression]] indicated on it.

The songwriter may expand upon the melody and chord progression by adding an instrumental melody (which may occur before or after the vocal melody, or alongside the vocal melody) and creating a more complex song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental solo section, verse, etc.).

==Beat-making==
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_production|title=Beat Making|publisher=''Hip Hop Production''|date=8 April 2018|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thesingersworkshop.com/writing-tracks-first|title=Writing Tracks First|publisher=''thesingersworkshop''|date=8 April 2018|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''beatmaker'' often referred to as ''co-writer'', is a songwriter that composes the [[instrumental]] musical composition known as [[backing track]]'s or beats. The Beatmakers role is very similar to a [[film music]] composer who composes background music or soundtrack recordings for film production. Tools typically used are keyboards, drum machines, software synths and [[digital audio workstation]]s. Beatmakers aren't necessarily [[record producer]]s since they generally do not work directly with an artist in a [[recording studio]]. However, a traditional 
[[Record Producer]] can be involved in the co-writing process wearing two hats as the Producer and Songwriter for writing the instrumental backing tracks for the recording Artist, there forth the Producer would receive both songwriting and production credits. This is especially true for Hip Hop Producer's in urban [[Hip hop production]] which Co-Writing is an integrated into their role as a Producer such as [[Timbaland]] or [[Pharrell Williams]] opposed to a Rock Producer that rarely Co-Writes the Music. Beatmakers sells or licenses (musical instrumental compositions) or beats to a recording artist as the Co-Writer for use in pre-production to create a "New Song". The Record Producer or Artist then takes the musical composition as the backing track to produce an entire song with vocal production, lyrics and arrangement glued together known as the '''Masters'''. Beatmakers often receive songwriting credits, writing and publishing royalties for their musical work.

==Singer-songwriters==
Many singers also write songs for themselves, and as such, they are usually referred to as [[singer-songwriter]]s.

==Co-writing==
{{tone|section|date=January 2016}}
When a song is written by more than one person, it is co-written, or written jointly or in collaboration with another author.&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition|date=2011 |accessdate=29 September 2015 | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cowriting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-writers create songs in different ways. Some co-writers use a "stream of consciousness" approach, throwing out every single line or word or rhyme that comes to them. By letting ideas flow, this generates potential lyrics and song structures more effectively than trying to writing the song by discussing options. Co-writing can help two creators with different talents and strengths to create a new song that neither could have been able to devise if they were working alone.&lt;ref name="Co-Writing"&gt;{{cite web|title= Co-Writing|date=2015 |accessdate=29 September 2015|url=http://www.taxi.com/transmitter/0903/co-writing-songs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in co-writing is to establish the division of the contribution between co-writers. In copyright law, there is no distinction of importance between the lyrics of the song or the melody of the song, therefore each writer is given ownership equally over all of the song, unless another agreement is arranged.&lt;ref name="Music Connection"&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Connection|date=2013 |accessdate=29 September 2015|url=http://www.musicconnection.com/co-writing-tips-for-songwriters/}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phantom" songwriters are those who provided small contributions to the song, such as a band member who suggests a line for a verse or a [[session musician]] who informally proposes a chord progression for a coda. Once a songwriter is acknowledged as a cowriter on the project, this is almost impossible to undo, so "phantom" songwriters are not usually given credit.

==Top-liners==
A top-liner is a songwriter who writes a song over a pre-made beat. Top-lining differs from songwriting in that the writer is not creating a song from scratch, but rather creating lyrics and melodies over an existing [[music genre]], [[tonality]], [[harmony]], [[rhythm]], and [[musical form|form]] of a song.&lt;ref name="sonic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samama|first1=Benjamin|title=What's the Difference Between a Songwriter and a Topline Writer?|url=http://blog.sonicbids.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-songwriter-and-a-topline-writer|website=sonicbids.com|publisher=Sonicbids Inc.|date=2 March 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern commercial writing, it is a common practice for the musical track to be produced first without any vocal melody or lyrics. This is partially due to the rise of portable music production equipment and digital audio workstations that are designed for the swift arrangement of electronic music, such as Ableton Live.&lt;ref name="mella"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dee|first1=Mella|title=Toplining – What it is (and Isn’t) and How to Become a Topliner|url=https://mellamusic.com/toplining/|website=Mella Music|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top-liner usually is also a singer, and will sing over the [[Album#Music_track|track]] as the [[Demo (music)|demo]] singer. If the song is for a particular artist, the top-liner may sing the demo in that artist’s style. Topliners often work in groups to co-write. Sometimes producers send out tracks to more than one top-line writer so that the producer or singer could choose the best option. Since the track is the same, melodies by different writers can sometimes be very similar. Occasionally, the producer might choose a few lines of melodic or lyrical ideas from one top-liner without properly crediting or paying them. These situations sometimes result in legal battles over ownership of the melodies or lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seabrook|first1=John|title=The Song Machine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/the-song-machine|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a way to prevent such legal battles. A songwriter can commit their "intent to make a song", which prevents any of the parties ripping the song apart. Some artists send out a legal disclaimer making clear that if their melody isn't used after doing a topline, it reverts back to them, and the track back to the track writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindvvall|first1=Helienne|title=Behind the music: Why topline melody writing creates disputes between artists and songwriters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/26/topline-melody-disputes-artists-songwriters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Diné Bahaneʼ#Spider Man, Spider Woman and Weaving|Diné Bahaneʼ]]'' creation narrative of the Navajo (recorded 1928) includes a mention of "Spider Man and Spider Woman", who introduced the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan, Aileen, ''The Diné: Origin Myths of the Navajo Indians'' (Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, "The Age of Beginning", transcribed 1928).

According to the [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[string game]]s were given to them by Grandmother Spider.&lt;ref&gt;Allan and Paulette Macfarlan (1958). ''Handbook of American Indian Games'', p.189. {{ISBN|978-0-486-24837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] tradition, Spider Old Woman appears as the equivalent of "[[Tsichtinako|Thought Woman]]" ([[Keresan languages|Keresan]] ''Tse-che-nako, Sussistanako''): while the name of "Thought Woman" was reserved for sacred ceremonies, Spider Woman would be used in the context of everyday discussion or teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"Some confusion is sometimes created concerning Tse che nako and Old Spider Woman, especially in secular discussions. [[Keres people|Kere]] holy men hesitate to mention Tse che nako's name, especially for purely secular discussions; Thought Woman's name is reserved for use only in sacred ceremonies. In secular discussions and teachings, Tse che nako is often symbolically referred to as Old Spider Woman or Spider Woman. "Purley, Anthony F. (1974). "Keres Pueblo Concepts of Deity," ''American Indian Culture and Research'', 1, no.1: 31. Quoted in: Buell, Lawrence (1996). ''The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture'', p.518-519., n.27. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674258624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Karl Taube]] in 1983 tentatively connected the South Western "Spider Woman" mytheme with the pre-Columbian [[Teotihuacan]] "[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]]" known from pictorial representations.

== Other regions==
The [[Ojibwe people]] (Chippewa) of southern Canada and northern US speak of Spider Woman, known as ''Asibikaashi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=John Pratt|title=God and dreams : is there a connection?|date=2010|publisher=Resource Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=9781606086674|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a helper of the people, and inspiring mothers (or other close female relatives) to weave protective [[dreamcatcher|spider web charms]].&lt;ref name=Densmore&gt;Densmore, Frances (1929, 1979) ''Chippewa Customs''.

In the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], the [[Coos people]] of [[Oregon, USA|Oregon]] have their version of a Spider Grandmother traditional tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo J. Frachtenberg]] (1913).

The [[Choctaw people]] of [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] tell the story of Grandmother Spider stealing fire, then after animals refused it, bringing fire to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenouspeople.net/spider.htm] "Grandmother Spider Steals the Fire" story {{verify credibility|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hazen-Hammond (1997, 1999) compiled numerous tales collected from various tribes.&lt;ref&gt;''Timelines of Native American History'' Penguin Group (USA) 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-399-52307-6}}, ''Spider Woman's Web''  (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-399-52546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Murray Mednick]] wrote seven one-act plays called ''The Coyote Cycle'' with the same four characters: [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]], Coyote [[trickster]], Spider Grandmother and Mute Girl.&lt;ref&gt;Mednick, Murray (1993). ''The Coyote Cycles'', Padua Playwright's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-9630126-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same characters come from traditional Native American stories and myths.

Boulter was educated at [[Clare College, Cambridge]] before being [[called to the Bar]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BLTR873SC|name=Boulter, Stanley Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Obituary: p. 152, ''The Annual Register: a review of public events at home and abroad, for the year 1917''. London: Longmans, Green and Co. 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 28 January 1879, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; During his legal career, he was at one point editor of the Law Reports in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  As a barrister he concentrated on commercial and financial civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 March 1883, p. 6; 18 April 1883, p. 6; 30 April 1883, p. 3; and 4 July 1883, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criminal cases as he took were generally concerned with fraud and breaches of bankruptcy laws.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''The Times'', 16 May 1884, p. 33; and 30 October 1885, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1885 onwards he was sufficiently eminent to appear before the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1885, p. 5; and 8 July 1885, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Boulter turned his energies to finance.  He was one of the founders of the [[Law Debenture Corporation]], of which he remained the chairman until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesharegallery.co.uk/1939_Law_Debenture.htm The Share Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also chairman of the Imperial Colonial Finance and Agency Corporation, and the New Investment Company.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;''The Times'', 9 January 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' called him "one of the leading representatives of the great [[Trust company|Trust Companies]]....  Nobody was better than Mr. Boulter at handling a difficult meeting of shareholders ... and restoring confidence."&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;

In politics, Boulter began as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], but disagreed with his party leader, [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]], over [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish home rule]]. Boulter stood unsuccessfully as a "[[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]]" in the general election of 1886,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 July 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and his political views came to be aligned with those of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] party, particularly on any matters affecting the integrity of the [[British empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Boulter, Stanley.  "Liberal Votes and the Boers", ''The Times'', 18 October 1900&lt;/ref&gt; In social politics he remained more liberal, advocating public assistance for working men to buy homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Municipal aided purchase of artisans' dwellings", ''[[The Observer]]'', 31 July 1894, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later years, he was a [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Family==
The son of John Boulter of [[Frimley]], Surrey, Boulter first married Edith ''née'' Anderson. There were three sons and four daughters of the marriage.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U193749 " Boulter, Stanley Carr"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 18 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Edith died in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 September 1896, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1902, he married [[Helen Carte]].  Her first husband, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], had built and operated both the [[Savoy Theatre]] and [[Savoy Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 May 1902, p. 1. The wedding took place on 25 April 1902 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].&lt;/ref&gt; Boulter used the Law Debenture Corporation to assist in raising funds for expansion of the hotel and was appointed vice-chairman of the Savoy hotel group.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Stanley Boulter", obituary, ''The Times'', 8 January 1917, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  After his wife's death in 1913, he continued as vice-chairman and assisted the new chairman, her stepson [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], with matters related to the D'Oyly Carte businesses.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1915, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulter died in London in 1917 at the age of 64.

'''Two Soldiers and a Serving Woman with a Trumpeter''''' (c. 1650–1655) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "278. Officers resting in a Stable. Two jovial officers are resting in a stable. A comely woman offers them a jug of wine. At the door stands a trumpeter blowing his trumpet. Through an open door at the back are seen people at play. 
Panel, 30 inches by 26 inches. Sales. H. A. Bauer and others, Amsterdam, September 11, 1820, No. 55 
(61 florins, Meusardt). P. J. de Marneffe, Brussels, May 22, 1830, No. 148."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/553/mode/1up entry 278 for Officers resting in a Stable] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings De Hooch made in this period:

The '''Tübingen Hoplitodromos Runner''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Tübinger Waffenläufer'', i.e. literally: ''Tübingen weapons runner'') is an antique [[statuette]] of a Greek athlete with a helmet made around 485 BC in [[Attica]]. It is exhibited in the museum of the [[University of Tübingen]]. At the end of the 19th century, the characteristic posture of the athlete led [[Friedrich Hauser]] to interpret the statuette as an armed [[hoplitodromos]] runner in the starting position, an interpretation that is undisputed today.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"&gt;Kathrin B. Zimmer: [https://www.tagblatt.de/Nachrichten/Schatz-des-Monats-Januar-Der-Waffenlaeufer-ist-ein-altbekanntes-Tuebinger-Highlight-271841.html ''Schatz des Monats Januar: Der Waffenläufer ist ein altbekanntes Tübinger Highlight - Kleiner Athlet als Meisterwerk.''] Tagblatt, 5. January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Description ==

The small statuette is made from solid tin bronze. It represents a bearded naked man with a helmet in a forward leaning position making a small step with the left leg.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt; The athlete stands in the starting position typical for the Greeks, with the left leg stepping slightly forward and the right arm being stretched horizontally forward with open hand.&lt;ref name="Kulturgut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturgut.info/mufue/m47/pics.html |title=Kulturgut |dead-url= |access-date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole in his left fist clearly indicates that he originally held an object.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt;  Both feet stand on the ground, as if the runner is waiting for the sign to start the race, with his bearded face being raised expectantly. He bent his knees and tensed his inclined and well-muscled torso for the start. The chest is turned towards his left arm, on which he probably wore a round shield.&lt;ref&gt;Carol C. Mattusch: [https://books.google.de/books?id=90N6G-y0TCgC&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=Hg-30kuujp&amp;dq=t%C3%BCbingen%20weapons%20runner&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=t%C3%BCbingen%20weapons%20runner&amp;f=false ''Greek Bronze Statuary: From the Beginnings Through the Fifth Century B.C.''] Cornell University Press, 1988, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette is missing its once separately worked shield.&lt;ref name="Kulturgut"/&gt; The helmet bush is also lost by now, but ran originally forwards and backwards and initially hung down far to the back. By means of two round pins on the soles of the feet, the figure is firmly connected with its flat bronze base plate.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt;

His nakedness characterizes the man depicted as an athlete. However, it does not correspond to reality, because in the race over 2 stadiums (350 meters) in addition to the shield and the helmet they had to wear a heavy [[muscle cuirass]] ([[body armour]]), sometimes even leg splints. The hoplitodromos was used for the physical training of the heavily armed warriors. At the same time, it was a combat tactic: Thus the united Greek army had initiated the decisive defeat of the Persians at the Battle of Marathon 490 BC with its attack on the run.&lt;ref name="Kulturgut"/&gt;

== History ==

A winner of a [[hoplitodromos]] competition might have commissioned the bronze figure around 485 BC and then donated it to the [[Acropolis]] of [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="Kulturgut"/&gt; The statuette might have been used as a votive by a victorious athlete in the sanctuary, where it was probably placed at a well visible location with an inscription, so that every passer-by was informed about the name and performance of the victorious athlete.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt;

[[Carl Sigmund Tux]] (1715-1798), a governmental officer, had inherited the statue from his father, and donated his collection to the University of Tübingen, when he died without heirs on 29 January 1798. The statue had initially an inconspicuous existence in Tübingen, until its value was recognised by the Munich court councilor [[Friedrich Thiersch]]. He recognized in 1827 the similarity of the 163 mm high bronze statue with the nearly life-size marble [[Temple of Aphaea#Pedimental sculptures|pedimental sculptures]] of the [[Temple of Aphaea]] on [[Aegina]], which had arrived at that time in Munich, supplemented and reconstructed by the sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] in Rome. It became thus apparent that the statue had to be supplemented with a shield.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt; 

The statue was originally kept by the University Library of Tübingen, which moved to the castle in 1831. In 1833 it was given its own pedestal with a glass hood in the northeast tower of the castle. On the detour via various accommodations of the collection of classical antiquities in the Pfleghof and in Wilhelmstraße 9, the bronze statuette found its way back to the castle in 1997/98, to the same tower room that it had left over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Kulturgut"/&gt;

As shown by x-rays, the statuette manufactured as a solid casting by the [[lost wax process]]. Three samples were taken in 1886 for a material analysis from the attached bottom plate and analyzed by the Tübingen chemist [[Lothar Mayer]]. The alloy is composed of 88 % copper, 11 % tin and 0.4 % iron. Only recently, modern techniques could also provide information about the material composition of the statuette itself: Investigations of the surface by means of spatially resolved μ-X-ray fluorescence and μ-X-ray diffractometry clearly show a slightly different alloy of the figure and the base plate and indicate that these have probably been assembled just in modern times.&lt;ref name="Zimmer"/&gt;
