'''Ageing''' or '''aging''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Dropped "e"|spelling differences]]) is the process of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, [[Vegetative reproduction#Natural vegetative propagation|perennial plants]] and some simple animals are potentially [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing ([[Senescence#Cellular senescence|cellular senescence]]) or to the population of a species ([[population ageing]]).

In humans, ageing represents the accumulation of changes in a human being over time,&lt;ref name="Bowen 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000079125 |title=Living and Dying for Sex |year=2004 |last1=Bowen |first1=Richard L. |last2=Atwood |first2=Craig S. |journal=Gerontology |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=265–90 |pmid=15331856}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing [[Human body|physical]], [[psychological]], and social changes. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world events and wisdom may expand. Ageing is among the greatest known [[risk factor]]s for most human diseases:&lt;ref name="Dillin2014"/&gt; of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die from age-related causes.

The causes of ageing are uncertain; current theories are assigned to the damage concept, whereby the accumulation of damage (such as [[DNA oxidation]]) may cause biological systems to fail, or to the programmed ageing concept, whereby internal processes (such as [[DNA methylation]]) may cause ageing. Programmed ageing should not be confused with programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

The discovery, in 1934, that [[calorie restriction]] can extend lifespan by 50% in rats has motivated research into delaying and preventing ageing.

== Ageing versus immortality ==
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Immortal ''Hydra'', a relative of the jellyfish]]
Human beings and members of other species, especially animals, necessarily experience ageing and mortality. Fungi, too, can age.&lt;ref name="Mortimer 1959"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mortimer RK, Johnston JR| title = Life Span of Individual Yeast Cells | journal = Nature | volume = 183 | issue = 4677| pages = 1751–1752 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.1038/1831751a0 | pmid = 13666896 | pmc = | bibcode = 1959Natur.183.1751M | hdl = 2027/mdp.39015078535278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, many species can be considered [[biological immortality|immortal]]: for example, [[bacteria]] fission to produce daughter cells, [[strawberry]] plants grow runners to produce clones of themselves, and animals in the genus ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' have a regenerative ability by which they avoid dying of old age.

Early life forms on Earth, starting at least 3.7 billion years ago,&lt;ref name="Nutman 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nutman AP, Bennett VC, Friend CR, Van Kranendonk MJ, Chivas AR| title = Rapid emergence of life shown by discovery of 3,700-million-year-old microbial structures | journal = Nature | volume =  537| issue = 7621| pages = 535–538| year = 2016 | doi = 10.1038/nature19355 | pmid = 27580034 | pmc = | bibcode = 2016Natur.537..535N | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/smhpapers/4157 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; were single-celled organisms. Such organisms (prokaryotes, protozoans, algae) multiply by fissioning into daughter cells; thus do not age and are innately immortal.&lt;ref name=Rose1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Rose MR|title=Evolutionary Biology of Aging|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1991|isbn=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge1993"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Partridge L, Barton NH| title = Optimality, mutation and the evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 362 | issue = 6418| pages = 305–311| year = 1993 | doi =  10.1038/362305a0| pmid = 8455716 | pmc = | bibcode = 1993Natur.362..305P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual organism could henceforth pass on some of its genetic material to produce new individuals and could itself [[Evolution of ageing#Disposable soma theory|become disposable]] with respect to the survival of its species.&lt;ref name="Williams1957"/&gt; This classic biological idea has however been perturbed recently by the discovery that the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]'' may split into distinguishable daughter cells, which opens the theoretical possibility of "age classes" among bacteria.&lt;ref name="Stewart2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stewart EJ, Madden R, Paul G, Taddei F | title = Aging and death in an organism that reproduces by morphologically symmetric division | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e45| year = 2005 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030045 | pmid = 15685293 | pmc = 546039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within humans and other mortal species, there are cells with the potential for immortality: cancer cells which have lost the ability to die when maintained in a cell culture such as the [[HeLa]] cell line,&lt;ref name="PereiraSmith1992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pereira-Smith OM, Ning Y| title = Molecular genetic studies of cellular senescence | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 27 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 519–22 | year = 1992 | doi = | pmid = 1426085 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and specific [[stem cell]]s such as [[germ cell]]s (producing [[egg cell|ova]] and [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]).&lt;ref name="Forster 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster P, Hohoff C, Dunkelmann B, Schürenkamp M, Pfeiffer H, Neuhuber F, Brinkmann B | title = Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers | journal = Proc R Soc B | volume = 282 | issue = 1803 | pages = 1–6 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 | pmid = 25694621 | pmc = 4345458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In artificial [[cloning]], adult cells can be rejuvenated to embryonic status and then used to grow a new tissue or animal without ageing.&lt;ref name="Wakayama 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wakayama S, Kohda T, Obokata H, Tokoro M, Li C, Terashita Y, Mizutani E, Nguyen VT, Kishigami S, Ishino F, Wakayama T | title = Successful serial recloning in the mouse over multiple generations | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–297 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.005 | pmid = 23472871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal human cells however die after about 50 cell divisions in laboratory culture (the [[Hayflick Limit]], discovered by [[Leonard Hayflick]] in 1961).&lt;ref name="PereiraSmith1992"/&gt;

At present, researchers are only just beginning to understand the biological basis of ageing even in relatively simple and short-lived organisms such as yeast.&lt;ref name="Janssens 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Janssens GE, Meinema AC, González J, Wolters JC, Schmidt A, Guryev V, Bischoff R, Wit EC, Veenhoff LM, Heinemann M| title = Protein biogenesis machinery is a driver of replicative aging in yeast | journal = eLife | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = e08527 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.08527 | pmid = 26422514 | pmc = 4718733 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less still is known of mammalian ageing, in part due to the much longer lives of even small mammals such as the mouse (around 3 years).

The factors proposed to influence biological ageing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mitochondrial Theory of Aging and Other Aging Theories | publisher = 1Vigor | url = http://www.1vigor.com/science/mitochondrial-theory/ | accessdate = 4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fall into two main categories, ''programmed'' and ''damage-related''. Programmed factors follow a biological timetable, perhaps one that might be a continuation of the one that regulates childhood growth and development. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair and defence responses. Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.&lt;ref name="KunlinJin2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= |title=Modern Biological Theories of Aging.|year=2010 |last1=Jin|first1=Kunlin|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=72–74 |pmid=21132086|pmc=2995895 |journal=Aging Dis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a detailed review, Lopez-Otin and colleagues (2013), who discuss ageing through the lens of the damage theory, propose nine metabolic "hallmarks" of ageing in various organisms but especially mammals:&lt;ref name="Lopez-Otin2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Lopez-Otin|first1=C|last2= Blasco|first2=MA|last3= Partridge|first3=L|last4= Serrano|first4=M|last5= Kroemer|first5=G|year=2013|title=The hallmarks of aging.|url=|journal=Cell|volume=153|issue=6|pages=1194–1217|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039|pmc=3836174|pmid=23746838}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*genomic instability (mutations accumulated in nuclear DNA, in mtDNA, and in the nuclear lamina)
*telomere attrition (the authors note that artificial telomerase confers non-cancerous immortality to otherwise mortal cells)
*epigenetic alterations (including DNA methylation patterns, post-translational modification of histones, and chromatin remodelling)
*loss of [[proteostasis]] (protein folding and proteolysis)
*deregulated nutrient sensing (relating to the [[Insulin-like growth factor 1#Aging|Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling pathway]], which is the most conserved ageing-controlling pathway in evolution and among its targets are the [[FOXO|FOXO3]]/[[Sirtuin]] transcription factors and the mTOR complexes, probably responsive to [[caloric restriction]])
*mitochondrial dysfunction (the authors point out however that a causal link between ageing and increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species is no longer supported by recent research) 
*cellular senescence (accumulation of no longer dividing cells in certain tissues, a process induced especially by p16INK4a/Rb and p19ARF/p53 to stop cancerous cells from proliferating)
*stem cell exhaustion (in the authors' view caused by damage factors such as those listed above)
*altered intercellular communication (encompassing especially inflammation but possibly also other intercellular interactions)

There are three main metabolic pathways which can influence the rate of ageing, discussed below:
* the [[FOXO3]]/[[Sirtuin]] pathway, probably responsive to [[caloric restriction]]
* the [[Insulin-like growth factor 1#Aging|Growth hormone/Insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling pathway]]
* the activity levels of the [[electron transport chain]] in mitochondria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Biology of Aging|last1 = Guarente|last2 =  Partridge|last3 =  Wallace|first1 = Leonard P.|first2 =Linda|first3=Douglas C.|publisher = Cold Spring Harbor|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-87969-824-9|location = New York|pages = 347–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in plants) in chloroplasts.

It is likely that most of these pathways affect ageing separately, because targeting them simultaneously leads to additive increases in lifespan.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor RC, Dillin A | title=Aging as an event of proteostasis collapse. | journal=Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol | year= 2011 | volume= 3 | issue= 5 | pages=  a004440| pmid=21441594 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a004440 | pmc=3101847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmed factors===
The rate of ageing varies substantially across different species, and this, to a large extent, is genetically based. For example, numerous [[perennial plant]]s ranging from strawberries and potatoes to [[Willow#Cultivation|willow trees]] typically produce clones of themselves by [[vegetative reproduction]] and are thus potentially immortal, while [[annual plants]] such as wheat and watermelons die each year and reproduce by sexual reproduction. In 2008 it was discovered that inactivation of only two genes in the annual plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' leads to its conversion into a potentially immortal perennial plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18997783|year=2008|last1=Melzer|first1=S|last2=Lens|first2=F|last3=Gennen|first3=J|last4=Vanneste|first4=S|last5=Rohde|first5=A|last6=Beeckman|first6=T|title=Flowering-time genes modulate meristem determinacy and growth form in Arabidopsis thaliana|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1489–92|doi=10.1038/ng.253|journal=Nature Genetics|url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/record/429531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest animals known so far are 15,000-year-old Antarctic [[sponge]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC2017-OldestLivingThing&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Chesterton|first1=Marnie|title=The oldest living thing on Earth|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40224991|accessdate=16 September 2017|date=12 June 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can reproduce both sexually and clonally.

* [[Caloric restriction]] leads to longer lifespans in various species, an effect that is unclear,&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; but probably mediated by the nutrient-sensing function of the [[mTOR]] pathway.&lt;ref name="Fontana2010"/&gt;
* [[mTOR]], a protein that inhibits [[autophagy]], has been linked to ageing through the [[insulin]] signalling pathway. mTOR functions through nutrient and growth cues leading scientists to believe that dietary restriction and mTOR are related in terms of longevity.  When organisms restrict their diet, mTOR activity is reduced, which allows an increased level of autophagy. This recycles old or damaged cell parts, which increases longevity and decreases the chances of being obese. This is thought to prevent spikes of [[glucose]] concentration in the blood, leading to reduced insulin signalling. This has been linked to less mTOR activation as well.  Therefore, longevity has been connected to caloric restriction and insulin sensitivity inhibiting mTOR, which in turns allows autophagy to occur more frequently.  It may be that mTOR inhibition and autophagy reduce the effects of [[reactive oxygen species]] on the body, which damage DNA and other organic material, so longevity would be increased.&lt;ref name="Johnson et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature11861 |title=MTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease |year=2013 |last1=Johnson |first1=Simon C. |last2=Rabinovitch |first2=Peter S. |last3=Kaeberlein |first3=Matt |journal=Nature |volume=493 |issue=7432 |pages=338–45 |pmid=23325216 |pmc=3687363|bibcode=2013Natur.493..338J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In support  of this contention are observations that several purported anti-aging remedies including rapamycin, metformin, berberine, 2-deoxyglucose, vitamin D3, aspirin and resveratrol were shown to suppress mTOR signaling and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of oxidative DNA damage induced by endogenous oxidants.&lt;ref&gt;Halicka HD1, Zhao H, Li J, Lee YS, Hsieh TC, Wu JM, Darzynkiewicz Z.

* A decreased [[Insulin-like growth factor 1#Aging|Growth hormone/Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 signalling pathway]] has been associated with increased life span in various organisms including fruit flies, nematodes and mice. The precise mechanism by which decreased GH/IGF-1 signalling increases longevity is unknown, but various mouse strains with decreased GH and/or IGF-1 induced signalling share a similar phenotype which includes increased insulin sensitivity, enhanced stress resistance and protection from carcinogenesis. The studied mouse strains with decreased GH signalling showed between 20% and 68% increased longevity, and mouse strains with decreased IGF-1 induced signalling revealed a 19 to 33% increase in life span when compared to control mice.&lt;ref name="Junnila2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrendo.2013.67 |title=The GH/IGF-1 axis in ageing and longevity |year=2013 |last1=Junnila |first1=RK |last2=List |first2=EO |last3=Berryman |first3=DE|last4=Murrey|first4=JW |last5=Kopchick |first5=JJ |journal=Nat Rev Endocrinol |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=366–76 |pmid=23591370 |pmc=4074016 |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Evolution of aging|Evolutionary theories of ageing]]: Many have argued that life span, like other [[phenotypes]], is [[natural selection|selected]]. Traits that benefit early survival and reproduction will be [[natural selection|selected]] for even if they contribute to an earlier death. Such a genetic effect is called the [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|antagonistic pleiotropy]] effect when referring to a gene (pleiotropy signifying the gene has a double function – enabling reproduction at a young age but costing the organism life expectancy in old age) and is called the [[Evolution of aging|disposable soma]] effect when referring to an entire genetic programme (the organism diverting limited resources from maintenance to reproduction).&lt;ref name="Williams1957"/&gt; The biological mechanisms which regulate lifespan evolved several hundred million years ago.&lt;ref name="Reis2009" /&gt;

** The [[reproductive-cell cycle theory]] argues that ageing is regulated specifically by reproductive hormones that act in an antagonistic [[pleiotropic]] manner via cell cycle signalling, promoting growth and development early in life to achieve reproduction, but becoming dysregulated later in life, driving senescence (dyosis) in a futile attempt to maintain reproductive ability.&lt;ref name="Bowen 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20851172"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.007 |title=The reproductive-cell cycle theory of aging: An update |year=2011 |last1=Atwood |first1=Craig S. |last2=Bowen |first2=Richard L. |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=46 |issue=2–3 |pages=100–7 |pmid=20851172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endocrine dyscrasia that follows the loss of follicles with menopause, and the loss of Leydig and Sertoli cells during andropause, drive aberrant cell cycle signalling that leads to cell death and dysfunction, tissue dysfunction (disease) and ultimately death. Moreover, the hormones that regulate reproduction also regulate cellular metabolism, explaining the increases in fat deposition during pregnancy through to the deposition of centralised adiposity with the dysregulation of the HPG axis following menopause and during andropause (Atwood and Bowen, 2006). This theory, which introduced a new definition of ageing, has facilitated the conceptualisation of why and how ageing occurs at the evolutionary, physiological and molecular levels.&lt;ref name="Bowen 2004"/&gt;
* Autoimmunity: The idea that ageing results from an increase in [[autoantibodies]] that attack the body's tissues. A number of diseases associated with ageing, such as [[atrophic gastritis]] and [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], are probably autoimmune in this way. However, while inflammation is very much evident in old mammals, even completely [[Severe combined immunodeficiency#SCID in animals|immunodeficient]] mice raised in [[Specific-pathogen-free|pathogen-free]] laboratory conditions still experience senescence.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* The cellular balance between energy generation and consumption (energy homeostasis) requires tight regulation during ageing.

DNA damage causes the cells to stop dividing or induces [[apoptosis]], often [[Stem cell theory of aging|affecting stem cell pools]] and hence hindering regeneration. However, lifelong studies of mice suggest that most mutations happen during embryonic and childhood development, when cells divide often, as each cell division is a chance for errors in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L.

* [[Genetic instability]]: In heart muscle cells, dogs annually lose approximately 3.3% of the DNA in their heart muscle cells while humans lose approximately 0.6% of their heart muscle DNA each year.  These numbers are close to the ratio of the maximum longevities of the two species (120 years vs. 20 years, a 6/1 ratio).  The comparative percentage is also similar between the dog and human for yearly DNA loss in the brain and lymphocytes.  As stated by lead author, [[Bernard L. Strehler]], "...&amp;nbsp;genetic damage (particularly gene loss) is almost certainly (or probably the) central cause of ageing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bernard L. |last1=Strehler  |title=Genetic instability as the primary cause of human aging |journal=Experimental Gerontology |year=1986 |volume=21 |issue=4–5 |pages=283–319 |doi=10.1016/0531-5565(86)90038-0|pmid=3545872  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Accumulation of waste: 
**A buildup of waste products in cells presumably interferes with metabolism. For example, a waste product called [[lipofuscin]] is formed by a complex reaction in cells that binds fat to proteins. This waste accumulates in the cells as small granules, which increase in size as a person ages.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrilov, L. A.; Gavrilova, N. S.

**The hallmark of ageing yeast cells appears to be overproduction of certain proteins.&lt;ref name="Janssens 2015"/&gt;
**[[Autophagy]] induction can enhance clearance of toxic intracellular waste associated with neurodegenerative diseases and has been comprehensively demonstrated to improve lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, rodents and primates.

*Studies of mtDNA mutator mice have shown that increased levels of somatic mtDNA mutations directly can cause a variety of ageing phenotypes.

Notwithstanding the similarly low calorie intake, the diet composition differed between the two studies (notably a high [[sucrose]] content in the Wisconsin study), and the monkeys have different origins (India, China), initially suggesting that genetics and dietary composition, not merely a decrease in calories, are factors in longevity.&lt;ref name="Junnila2013"/&gt; However, in a comparative analysis in 2014, the Wisconsin researchers found that the allegedly non-starved NIA control monkeys in fact are moderately underweight when compared with other monkey populations, and argued this was due to the NIA's apportioned feeding protocol in contrast to Wisconsin's truly unrestricted ''ad libitum'' feeding protocol.&lt;ref name=Colman2014&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Colman RJ|author2=Beasley TM|author3=Kemnitz JW|author4=Johnson SC|author5=Weindruch R|author6=Anderson RM|title=Caloric restriction reduces age-related and all-cause mortality in rhesus monkeys|journal=Nature Communications|date=Apr 1, 2014|volume=5|page=3557|doi=10.1038/ncomms4557|pmid=24691430|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140401/ncomms4557/full/ncomms4557.html|accessdate=30 April 2014|pmc=3988801|bibcode = 2014NatCo...5E3557C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude that moderate calorie restriction rather than extreme calorie restriction is sufficient to produce the observed health and longevity benefits in the studied rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;"There may be little advantage of moderate CR over modest CR—this would be an extremely important discovery and one that merits further investigation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''How and Why We Age'', Hayflick says that caloric restriction may not be effective in humans, citing data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging which shows that being thin does not favour longevity.{{Request quotation|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref name="Hayflick 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1=Hayflick| first1=Leonard.| title=How and why we age| year=1994 | publisher=Ballantine Books| location=New York| isbn=978-0-345-33918-8| oclc=29908633| page=261  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it is sometimes claimed that moderate ''obesity'' in later life may improve survival, but newer research has identified confounding factors such as weight loss due to terminal disease. Once these factors are accounted for, the optimal body weight above age 65 corresponds to a leaner [[body mass index]] of 23 to 27.&lt;ref name=Bowman2016&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bowman K|author2=Delgado J|author3=Henley WE|author4=Masoli JA|author5=Kos K|author6=Brayne C|author7=Thokala P|author8=Lafortune L|author9=Kuchel GA|author10=Ble A|author11=Melzer D|author12=Ageing Well Programme of the NIHR School for Public Health Research, England|title=Obesity in Older People With and Without Conditions Associated With Weight Loss: Follow-up of 955,000 Primary Care Patients|journal=J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci|date=Aug 4, 2016|volume=72|issue=2|pages=203–209|doi=10.1093/gerona/glw147|pmid=27492450|url=|pmc=5233914|bibcode = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer geneticist [[Ronald A. DePinho]] and his colleagues published research in mice where [[telomerase]] activity was first genetically removed. Then, after the mice had prematurely aged, they restored telomerase activity by reactivating the telomerase gene. As a result, the mice were rejuvenated: Shrivelled testes grew back to normal and the animals regained their fertility. Other organs, such as the spleen, liver, intestines and brain, recuperated from their degenerated state. "[The finding] offers the possibility that normal human ageing could be slowed by reawakening the enzyme in cells where it has stopped working" says Ronald DePinho. However, activating telomerase in humans could potentially encourage the growth of tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2010.635 |title=Telomerase reverses ageing process |year=2010 |last1=Callaway |first1=Ewen |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The Bartke2011 reference has a lot of information on specific mutations which could be discussed here.--&gt;
Most known genetic interventions in ''C. elegans'' increase lifespan by 1.5 to 2.5-fold. {{as of|2009}}, the record for lifespan extension in C. ''elegans'' is a single-gene mutation which increases adult survival by tenfold.&lt;ref name="Reis2009"/&gt; The strong conservation of some of the mechanisms of ageing discovered in model organisms imply that they may be useful in the enhancement of human survival. However, the benefits may not be proportional; longevity gains are typically greater in ''C. elegans'' than fruit flies, and greater in fruit flies than in mammals. One explanation for this is that mammals, being much longer-lived, already have many traits which promote lifespan.&lt;ref name="Reis2009"/&gt;

Different cultures express age in different ways. The age of an adult human is commonly measured in whole years since the day of birth. Arbitrary divisions set to mark periods of life may include: [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] (via [[Infant|infancy]], [[childhood]], [[preadolescence]], [[adolescence]]), [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|early adulthood]], [[Middle age|middle adulthood]], and [[Senior citizen|late adulthood]]. More casual terms may include "teenagers," "[[Tween (demographic)|tweens]]," "twentysomething", "thirtysomething", etc. as well as "denarian", "vicenarian", "tricenarian", "quadragenarian", etc.

Most legal systems define a specific age for when an individual is allowed or obliged to do particular activities. These age specifications include [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[marriageable age]], [[age of candidacy]], and [[mandatory retirement age]]. Admission to a movie for instance, may depend on age according to a [[motion picture rating system]]. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old. Each nation, government and non-governmental organisation has different ways of classifying age. In other words, [[Chronology|chronological]] ageing may be distinguished from "social ageing" (cultural age-expectations of how people should act as they grow older) and "biological ageing" (an organism's physical state as it ages).&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nallétamby (2010) ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology''. SAGE Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-4462-0428-3}}. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a UNFPA report about ageing in the 21st century, it highlighted the need to "Develop a new rights-based culture of ageing and a change of mindset and societal attitudes towards ageing and older persons, from welfare recipients to active, contributing members of society."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt; UNFPA said that this "requires, among others, working towards the development of international human rights instruments and their translation into national laws and regulations and affirmative measures that challenge age discrimination and recognise older people as autonomous subjects."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt;  Older people's music participation contributes to the maintenance of interpersonal relationships and promoting successful ageing.&lt;ref&gt;LO, W.

Ageing and Society, 35(8), 1614-1634. doi:10.1017/S0144686X14000439&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, older persons can make contributions to society including caregiving and volunteering. For example, "A study of Bolivian migrants who [had] moved to Spain found that 69% left their children at home, usually with grandparents. In rural China, grandparents care for 38% of children aged under five whose parents have gone to work in cities."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt;

Population ageing is the increase in the number and proportion of older people in society. Population ageing has three possible causes: migration, longer [[life expectancy]] (decreased death rate) and decreased birth rate. Ageing has a significant impact on society. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the [[age of majority]]), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights.&lt;ref name="Vincent 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00084.x |title=Understanding generations: Political economy and culture in an ageing society |year=2005 |last1=Vincent |first1=John A. |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=579–99 |pmid=16309437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, one of the most significant population trends is ageing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/population-ageing-and-development-0 |title=Population Ageing and Development |year=2002 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, over 11% of the world's current population are people aged 60 and older and the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) estimates that by 2050 that number will rise to approximately 22%.&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/ageing-twenty-first-century |title=Ageing in the Twenty-First Century |year=2012 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageing has occurred due to development which has enabled better nutrition, sanitation, health care, education and economic well-being. Consequently, fertility rates have continued to decline and life expectancy have risen. Life expectancy at birth is over 80 now in 33 countries. Ageing is a "global phenomenon," that is occurring fastest in developing countries, including those with large youth populations, and poses social and economic challenges to the work which can be overcome with "the right set of policies to equip individuals, families and societies to address these challenges and to reap its benefits."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/ageing|title=Ageing - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|date=|work=unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As life expectancy rises and [[birth rates]] decline in developed countries, the [[median]] age rises accordingly. According to the [[United Nations]], this process is taking place in nearly every country in the world.&lt;ref name="devrep05"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR05_complete.pdf|
title=UN Human Development Report 2005|format=PDF|accessdate=7 October 2010|publisher=United Nations Development Programme |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527203423/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr05_complete.pdf |archivedate = 27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rising median age can have significant social and economic implications, as the workforce gets progressively older and the number of old workers and retirees grows relative to the number of young workers. Older people generally incur more health-related costs than do younger people in the workplace and can also cost more in worker's compensation and pension liabilities.&lt;ref name="aging-workforce"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chosewood|first=L. Casey|title=Safer and Healthier at Any Age: Strategies for an Aging Workforce|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/agingworkforce/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most developed countries an older workforce is somewhat inevitable. In the United States for instance, the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that one in four American workers will be 55 or older by 2020.&lt;ref name = aging-workforce/&gt;

Among the most urgent concerns of older persons worldwide is income security. This poses challenges for governments with ageing populations to ensure investments in pension systems continues in order to provide economic independence and reduce poverty in old age. These challenges vary for developing and developed countries. UNFPA stated that, "Sustainability of these systems is of particular concern, particularly in developed countries, while social protection and old-age pension coverage remain a challenge for developing countries, where a large proportion of the labour force is found in the informal sector."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt;

The global economic crisis has increased financial pressure to ensure economic security and access to health care in old age. In order to elevate this pressure "social protection floors must be implemented in order to guarantee income security and access to essential health and social services for all older persons and provide a safety net that contributes to the postponement of disability and prevention of impoverishment in old age."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt;

It has been argued that population ageing has undermined economic development.&lt;ref name="Basakha 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basakha M |author2=Yavari K |author3=Sadeghi H |author4=Naseri A. |title=Population Aging And Iran's Non-Oil Economic Growth|journal= Payavard Salamat |year=2015|volume= 9 |issue=2|pages= 131–146|url=http://payavard.tums.ac.ir/browse.php?a_code=A-10-1-113&amp;sid=1&amp;slc_lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence suggests that pensions, while making a difference to the well-being of older persons, also benefit entire families especially in times of crisis when there may be a shortage or loss of employment within households. A study by the Australian Government in 2003 estimated that "women between the ages of 65 and 74 years contribute A$16 billion per year in unpaid caregiving and voluntary work. Similarly, men in the same age group contributed A$10 billion per year."&lt;ref name="Ageing in the Twenty-First Century"/&gt;

Due to increasing share of the elderly in the population, health care expenditures will continue to grow relative to the economy in coming decades. This has been considered as a negative phenomenon and effective strategies like labour productivity enhancement should be considered to deal with negative consequences of ageing.&lt;ref name="Basakha 2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Basakha M, Yavari K, Sadeghi H, Naseri A |title=Ageing and Macroeconomics; Healthcare cost disease as a threat to Iranian ageing society |journal=Journal of Research in Health Sciences |year=2014 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=152–6 |url=http://jrhs.umsha.ac.ir/index.php/JRHS/article/view/1109/pdf|pmid=24728752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
In the field of sociology and mental health, ageing is seen in five different views: ageing as [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]], ageing as decline, ageing as a life-cycle event, ageing as generation, and ageing as survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheid|first1=Teresa L.|last2=Brown|first2=Tony N.|title=A Handbook for the Study of Mental Health|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive correlates with ageing often include economics, employment, marriage, children, education, and sense of control, as well as many others, being acknowledged that resources and reserves can influence ageing differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[social science of aging|social science of ageing]] includes disengagement theory, activity theory, selectivity theory, and continuity theory. [[Retirement]], a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Panek, Paul E. |author2=Hayslip, Bert |title=Adult development and aging|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|year=1989|isbn=978-0-06-045012-0|oclc=}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of ageing and for instance a bio-techno-social definition of ageing has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Wejbrandt (2014) Defining aging in cyborgs: A bio-techno-social definition of aging, Journal of Aging Studies, Volume 31, Pages 104–109&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a current debate as to whether or not the pursuit of [[longevity]] and the postponement of senescence are cost-effective health care goals given finite health care resources. Because of the accumulated infirmities of old age, bioethicist [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], opines that the pursuit of longevity via the [[compression of morbidity]] hypothesis is a "fantasy" and that human life is not worth living after age 75; longevity then should not be a goal of health care policy.&lt;ref name=Emmanuel&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Emmanuel EJ|title=Why I hope to die at 75: An argument that society and families – and you – will be better off if nature takes its course swiftly and promptly|journal=The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/|accessdate=7 April 2015|date=October 2014 Issue}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion has been contested by neurosurgeon and medical ethicist [[Miguel Faria]], who states that life can be worthwhile during old age, and that longevity should be pursued in association with the attainment of quality of life.&lt;ref name="Faria 75"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria MA|title=Bioethics and why I hope to live beyond age 75 attaining wisdom!: A rebuttal to Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel′s 75 age limit.|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint_articles/bioethics-and-why-i-hope-to-live-beyond-age-75-attaining-wisdom-a-rebuttal-to-dr-ezekiel-emanuels-75-age-limit/|publisher=Surg Neurol Int 2015;6:35|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria claims that postponement of senescence as well as happiness and wisdom can be attained in old age in a large proportion of those who lead healthy lifestyles and remain intellectually active.&lt;ref name="Faria longevity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria MA|title=Longevity and compression of morbidity from a neuroscience perspective: Do we have a duty to die by a certain age?|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint_articles/longevity-and-compression-of-morbidity-from-a-neuroscience-perspective-do-we-have-a-duty-to-die-by-a-certain-age/|publisher=Surg Neurol Int 2015;6:49|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care demand ===

With age inevitable biological changes occur that increase the risk of illness and disability. UNFPA states that,&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

"A life-cycle approach to health care – one that starts early, continues through the reproductive years and lasts into old age – is essential for the physical and emotional well-being of older persons, and, indeed, all people. Public policies and programmes should additionally address the needs of older impoverished people who cannot afford health care."

Many societies in Western Europe and Japan have ageing populations. While the effects on society are complex, there is a concern about the impact on health care demand. The large number of suggestions in the literature for specific interventions to cope with the expected increase in demand for long-term care in ageing societies can be organised under four headings: improve system performance; redesign service delivery; support informal caregivers; and shift demographic parameters.&lt;ref name=Saltman2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2190/AUL1-4LAM-4VNB-3YH0 |title=The Impact of Aging on Long-Term Care in Europe and Some Potential Policy Responses |year=2006 |last1=Chawla |first1=Mukesh |last2=Dubois |first2=Hans F. W. |last3=Chawla |first3=Richard B. |journal=International Journal of Health Services |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=719–46 |pmid=17175843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the annual growth in national health spending is not mainly due to increasing demand from ageing populations, but rather has been driven by rising incomes, costly new medical technology, a shortage of health care workers and informational asymmetries between providers and patients.&lt;ref name=Rheinhardt2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.6.27 |title=Does the Aging of the Population Really Drive the Demand for Health Care? |year=2003 |last1=Reinhardt |first1=U. E. |journal=Health Affairs |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=27–39 |pmid=14649430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of health problems become more prevalent as people get older. These include mental health problems as well as physical health problems, especially [[dementia]].

It has been estimated that population ageing only explains 0.2 percentage points of the annual growth rate in medical spending of 4.3% since 1970. In addition, certain reforms to the Medicare system in the United States decreased elderly spending on home health care by 12.5% per year between 1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name="Meara2004."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.4.176 |title=Trends in Medical Spending by Age, 1963–2000 |year=2004 |last1=Meara |first1=E. |last2=White |first2=C. |last3=Cutler |first3=D.

===Self-perception of ageing===
Positive [[Self-rated health|self-perception of health]] has been correlated with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly.&lt;ref name=Idler2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/43.3.372 |title=Discussion: Gender Differences in Self-Rated Health, in Mortality, and in the Relationship Between the Two |year=2003 |last1=Idler |first1=E.

===Successful ageing===
{{main|Successful ageing}}
The concept of ''successful ageing'' can be traced back to the 1950s and was popularised in the 1980s. Traditional definitions of successful ageing have emphasised absence of physical and cognitive disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511665684.003 |chapter=Psychological perspectives on successful aging: The model of selective optimization with compensation |title=Successful Aging |year=1990 |last1=Baltes |first1=Paul B. |last2=Baltes |first2=Margret M. |editor1-last=Baltes |editor1-first=Paul B. |editor2-last=Baltes |editor2-first=Margret M. |isbn=978-0-511-66568-4 |pages=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 1987 article, Rowe and Kahn characterised successful ageing as involving three components: a) freedom from disease and disability, b) high cognitive and physical functioning, and c) social and productive engagement.&lt;ref name="Human aging: Usual and successful"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.3299702 |title=Human aging: Usual and successful |year=1987 |last1=Rowe |first1=J. |last2=Kahn |first2=R. |journal=Science |volume=237 |issue=4811 |pages=143–9 |pmid=3299702|bibcode = 1987Sci...237..143R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
The ancient Greek dramatist [[Euripides]] (5th century BC) describes the multiply-headed mythological monster [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] as having a regenerative capacity which makes it immortal, which is the historical background to the name of the biological genus [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]. The [[Book of Job]] (c. 6th century BC) describes human lifespan as inherently limited and makes a comparison with the innate immortality that a felled tree may have when undergoing vegetative regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Job 14:5-7 ''A man’s days are numbered. You know the number of his months. He cannot live longer than the time You have set. So now look away from him that he may rest, until he has lived the time set for him like a man paid to work. For there is hope for a tree, when it is cut down, that it will grow again, and that its branches will not stop growing''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''anterior fornix erogenous zone''' (also known as the '''AFE zone''', '''AFE''', '''A-spot''', '''epicenter''', '''deep spot''' or '''second  [[G-spot]]''') is reportedly a female [[erogenous zone]] that when stimulated can lead to rapid [[vaginal lubrication]] and [[arousal]], sometimes without any other form of stimulation, with continued stimulation resulting in an intense [[orgasm]].

==Discovery==

===Early research===
The AFE zone concept is sometimes attributed to [[Malaysia]]n sex scientist Dr. Chua Chee Ann in 1989. In his research with [[women|female]] subjects suffering from [[vaginal dryness]] [https://www.confidentlovers.com/what-is-the-a-spot/], he found that stimulation of an area deep in the [[vagina]] on the [[anterior]] wall resulted in rapid lubrication and arousal. He did not make his discovery public until thirteen years after it was made.  However this location was described as an erogenous spot much earlier by [[Marie Stopes]] in her 1924 book "Contraception" &lt;ref&gt; * Stopes, Marie: Contraception (birth control), its theory, history and practice. London. John Bale, Sons &amp; Danielsson, limited, 1924.  p. 162.  Stopes locates the spot as "at the end of the vagina and near the cervix" and writes "These tissues are among the most sensitive of the woman and it is not good that they should be needlessly covered." (as they are by the [[Diaphragm (birth control) | diaphragm]] )&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-spot stimulation technique===
Dr. Chua Chee Ann has promoted his A-spot stimulation technique in books and at seminars as the most effective means of stimulating the AFE zone. The technique involves applying pressure to the area, making a scooping motion, and stimulating other parts of the vagina. He claims that if the technique is practiced for at least 10 minutes a day, it will make vaginal lubrication and orgasms regularly attainable, even without [[foreplay]].

==Location==

===Confusion===
The AFE zone is reported to be located at or near the [[Vaginal fornix|deepest point]] on the anterior wall of the [[vagina]], above the [[cervix]], where the anterior wall of the vagina starts to curve upward (the entrance to the [[vaginal fornix|anterior fornix]]), but some websites and news articles have described it as being on the posterior wall of the vagina, roughly opposite of the G-spot. Dr. Chua Chee Ann stated in an interview that this is completely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspot-pioneer.com/pdf/DrChuaInterviewScript.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that this area may be a different erogenous zone altogether.

===Connection to known female anatomy===
Some believe that the AFE zone is the anterior fornix itself, but it is thought by some sex experts to be a degenerated female [[prostate]] (a theory that has been applied to the G-spot and the [[Skene's gland]]) or the area where the vaginal nerves connect, which is thought to be near it. Speculation is that it is the [[vesicouterine pouch]], due to its proximity to the supposed location of the AFE zone and the supposed erogenous qualities of the [[rectouterine pouch]].

==Mechanism==

===Lubrication===
According to Dr. Chua Chee Ann, the AFE zone redirects female [[female ejaculation|ejaculatory fluid]], which is expelled from the Skene's gland during G-spot orgasms, and turns it into [[vaginal lubrication]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspot-pioneer.com/pdf/DrChua-Aspot-Pioneer.com.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Because stimulating the AFE zone causes this mechanism and creates an erotic sensation simultaneously, full arousal occurs very quickly.

===Orgasm===
The orgasms that result from stimulation of the AFE zone are thought to be distinct from the orgasms that result from stimulation of the [[clitoris]], but some women who have experienced them say that they are similar in sensation to orgasms achieved by G-spot stimulation, while others say that they are more "intense".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Avoided burden''' is an approach used in [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA), especially in the context of allocating environmental burden in the presence of [[recycling]] or [[reuse]]. When determining the overall [[environmental impact]] of a product, the product is given "credit" for the potential recycled material included. For instance, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles may be given environmental credit for the PET they contain, as this material will eventually be recycled back into further PET products.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Anna|title=LCA allocation methods in open-loop recycling: incentivizing recycled material sourcing and creation of recyclable products|url=http://www.lcacenter.org/LCAX/presentations-final/212.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This credit is termed "avoided burden" because it refers to the impact of virgin material production that is avoided by the use of recycled material.

==Material displacement==
The extent to which recycled material displaces production of virgin material of a similar or different type is the subject of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blomberg|author2=Hellmer|title=Short-run demand and supply elasticities in the West European market for secondary aluminium|journal=Resources Policy|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case studies, practitioners typically utilize [[heuristic]], arbitrary rules, such as assigning 100%, 50%, or 0% displacement of virgin material by recycled material.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyer1&gt;{{cite web|last=Geyer |first=Roland |title=Life Cycle Inventory Analysis |url=http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709231634/https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accurate information on the displacement rates of various materials is largely unknown. This information is important to LCA practitioners, as it can often tip the balance between two compared alternative products or materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Calculation==
Although the calculation of avoided burden is not without some degree of subjectivity, it is usually calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=geyer1 /&gt; 
:''Avoided Burden = (Material Recycling Rate) × ([[Life cycle assessment#Life cycle inventory|Functional Unit]]) × [(Impact of Virgin Production) − (Impact of Recycling)]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7671">'''Certified Backyard Wildlife Habitat''' is a program of the [[National Wildlife Federation]] that encourages homeowners in the United States to manage their [[gardens]] and yards as a [[wildlife garden]], with the goal of maintaining healthy and diverse animal [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s.  The program began in 1973.  By 1998, it had impacted more than 21,000 yards and, as of 2006, has certified over 60,000 'backyards'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danforth, Peter |year=2005 |title=An Evaluation of the National Wildlife Federation's Schoolyard Habitat Program in the Houston Independent School District |format=PDF |work=An Evaluation of the National Wildlife Federation's Schoolyard Habitat Program in the Houston Independent School District |url=http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/0032637E-007EA7AB.9/Danforth%20schoolyard%20habitat%202005.pdf |accessdate=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080613/http://www.peecworks.org/PEEC/PEEC_Research/0032637E-007EA7AB.9/Danforth%20schoolyard%20habitat%202005.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joyce, Stephanie |year=2000 |title=Why the Grass Isn't Always Greener |work=Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 106, Number 8, August 1998 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1998/106-8/focus.html |accessdate=2006-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013181443/http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1998/106-8/focus.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=National Wildlife Federation | year=2006 | title=Get Started!

==Certification==
To be a certified Backyard Wildlife Habitat, a garden or yard, or any outdoor space from a balcony up to a multi-acre tract of land, must offer food, water, shelter, and a place for raising young to [[beneficial insect]]s or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Lerner, Joel M. | title=Creating a Backyard Haven for Fauna | work=Washington Post, Saturday, January 7, 2006 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/06/AR2006010600767.html?nav=rss_realestate/own | accessdate=2006-05-25 | date=2006-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time the Federation has introduced variants or expansions of the program for schoolyards and for communities.

In order for a backyard to be certified as a Backyard Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation, the space must do all of the following: provide food, water, cover, a place to raise young, and be maintained in a way that has a positive effect o n the health of the soil, air, water, and habitat for native wildlife.  More specifically, the presence of native forbs, shrubs, and trees is necessary to provide food.  Water can be supplied by natural features such as a streams, ponds, or wetlands, or by human-made features such as bird baths.  Native vegetation can also provide cover and places for wildlife to raise their young, as can brush piles or dead trees.  With all of these features in place, it is crucial that the land be cared for thoughtfully and as naturally as possible.  Avoid the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reduce the area that turf grass occupies, utilize mulch obtained from sustainable forestry practices, and minimize water use in order to maintain the integrity of the soil, air, and water in and outside of the habitat.

== Effectiveness and success ==
Prior to 2004 there was no scientific study as to whether backyard habitats actually help butterflies.  A study published in 2004 of the effect on ''[[Pipevine swallowtail|Battus philenor]]'' in the San Francisco area found that gardens where the host plants were more than 40 years old, the gardens were as good as natural sites, where the host plants were less than eight years old the species was unlikely to visit, and in between the butterflies laid eggs but these had an inferior survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Levy, Jacqueline M.  |author2=Connor, Edward F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2000 | title=Are gardens effective in butterfly conservation? A case study with the pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor| work=Are gardens effective in butterfly conservation? A case study with the pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor | url=http://www.springerlink.com/(1o5epsfisxgwih554yrkk3j5)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,9;journal,7,36;linkingpublicationresults,1:100177,1 | accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no scientific study has been done that has studied Certified Wildlife Habitats, as defined above, specifically in terms of increased native biodiversity, extensive investigation has been made into the biodiversity benefits of using native plants in suburban and urban native landscapes in general.  An article published in Conservation Biology addresses the need to enhance the habitat value of suburban and urban spaces, which have been identified as a primary cause of decline in many threatened or endangered species, and promotes these areas as having potential for social and educational value as well.  The author asserts that using a more balanced approach to [[conservation biology]] that addresses more densely populated areas, rather than one that focuses mainly on relatively undisturbed areas, can help to mitigate effects of human land use (Miller, 2002).

==Native plants use==
One study that was published in Conservation Biology reported that [[native plant]]s supported more [[species]] of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]] than [[introduced species|introduced plants]] (Tallamy, 2009).  Another study, which studied species richness and diversity of small [[mammal]]s, recommended planting native trees along [[riparian zone]] stream corridors in order to promote more diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks after finding populations resembling natural conditions in parks managed for passive recreation as compared to those containing manicured habitats surrounded by human-modified landscapes (Mahan, 2005).  A second study compared properties landscaped with entirely [[native plant]]s with those containing a mix of native and non-native plants.  Results showed that the native properties supported significantly higher species richness and diversity of caterpillars and birds, as well as greater numbers of breeding pairs and biomass of native species (Burghardt, 2008).

'''Biblical minimalism''', also known as the '''Copenhagen School''' because two of its most prominent figures taught at [[Copenhagen University]], was a movement or trend in [[biblical scholarship]] that began in the 1990s with two main claims: 
# that the Bible cannot be considered reliable evidence for what had happened in ancient Israel; and  
# that "Israel" itself is a problematic subject for historical study.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA33#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20main%20claims&amp;f=false 33]}}

Minimalism was not a unified movement, but rather a label that came to be applied to several scholars at different universities who held similar views, chiefly [[Niels Peter Lemche]] and [[Thomas L. Thompson]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], [[Philip R. Davies]], and [[Keith Whitelam]]. Minimalism gave rise to intense debate during the 1990s—the term "minimalists" was in fact a derogatory one given by its opponents, who were consequently dubbed "maximalists", but in fact neither side accepted either label. 

The so-called Maximalists, or [[Biblical archaeology school#William F. Albright and the Biblical Archaeology school|neo-Albrightians]], were composed of two quite distinct groups, the first represented by the archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] and the influential publication ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', the second by biblical scholar [[Iain Provan]] and Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].{{sfn|Banks|2006|p=185}} Although these debates were in some cases heated, most scholars occupied the middle ground evaluating the arguments of both schools critically. 

Since the 1990s, while some of the minimalist arguments have been challenged or rejected, others have been refined and adopted into the mainstream of biblical scholarship.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}

==Background: academic study of the Bible in the 20th century==
By the opening of the 20th century the stories of the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], [[Noah's ark]], and the [[Tower of Babel]]—in short, chapters 1 to 11 of the [[Book of Genesis]]—had become subject to greater scrutiny by scholars, and the starting point for biblical history was regarded as the stories of Abraham, Isaac, and the other [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew patriarchs]]. Then in the 1970s, largely through the publication of two books, [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' it became widely accepted that the remaining chapters of Genesis were equally non-historical. At the same time, archaeology and comparative sociology convinced most scholars in the field that there was equally little historical basis to the biblical stories of [[the Exodus]] and the Israelite conquest of Canaan.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=18-20}}

By the 1980s, the Bible's stories of the Patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt and Conquest of Canaan were no longer considered historical, but biblical histories continued to use the Bible as a primary source and to take the form of narrative records of political events arranged in chronological order, with the major role played by (largely Judean) kings and other high-status individuals. At the same time, new tools and approaches were being brought to bear on scholars' knowledge of the past of ancient Canaan, notably new archaeological methods and approaches (for example, this was the age of surface surveys, used to map population changes which are invisible in the biblical narrative), and the social sciences (an important work in this vein was Robert Coote and Keith Whitlam's ''The Emergence of Early Israel in Historical Perspective'', which used sociological data to argue, in contradiction to the biblical picture, that it was kingship that formed Israel, and not the other way round). 

Then in the 1990s a school of thought emerged from the background of the 1970s and 1980s which held that the entire enterprise of studying ancient Israel and its history was seriously flawed by an over-reliance on the biblical text, which was too problematic (meaning untrustworthy) to be used even selectively as a source for Israel's past, and that Israel itself was in any case itself a problematic subject. This movement came to be known as biblical minimalism.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=27-33}}

==Biblical minimalism==
The scholars that have come to be called "minimalists" are not a unified group, and in fact deny that they form a group or "school": Philip Davies points out that while he argues that the bulk of the Bible can be dated to the Persian period (the 5th century BCE), Niels Peter Lemche prefers the Hellenistic period (3rd to 2nd centuries BCE), while Whitelam has not given any opinion at all. Similarly, while Lemche holds that the [[Tel Dan stele]] (an inscription from the mid-9th century BCE which seems to mention the name of [[David]]) is probably a forgery, Davies and Whitelam do not. In short, the minimalists do not agree on much more than that the Bible is a doubtful source of information about ancient Israel.{{sfn|Davies|n.d.|}}

===Bible as a historical source document===
The first of the minimalists' two central claims is based on the premise that history-writing is never objective, but involves the selection of data and the construction of a narrative using preconceived ideas of the meaning of the past&amp;mdash;the fact that history is thus never neutral or objective raises questions about the accuracy of any historical account.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=33}} The minimalists cautioned that the literary form of the biblical history books is so apparent and the authors' intentions so obvious that scholars should be extremely cautious in taking them at face value. Even if the Bible does preserve some accurate information, researchers lack the means to sift that information from the inventions with which it may have been mixed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=34-35}} 

The minimalists did not claim that the Bible is useless as a historical source; rather, they suggest that its proper use is in understanding the period in which it was written, a period which some of them place in the Persian period (5th–4th centuries BCE) and others in the Hellenistic period (3rd–2nd centuries).{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=35}}

===Historicity of the nation of Israel===
The second claim is that "Israel" itself is a difficult idea to define in terms of historiography. There is, firstly, the idealised Israel which the Bible authors created&amp;mdash;"biblical Israel". In the words of Niels Peter Lemche: 
{{quote|''The Israelite nation as explained by the biblical writers has little in the way of a historical background. It is a highly ideological construct created by ancient scholars of Jewish tradition in order to legitimize their own religious community and its religio-political claims on land and religious exclusivity.''| {{Harvnb|Lemche|1998|pp=165–66}} }}
Modern scholars have taken aspects of biblical Israel and married them with data from archaeological and non-biblical sources to create their own version of a past Israel&amp;mdash;"Ancient Israel". Neither bears much relationship to the kingdom destroyed by Assyria in about 722 BCE&amp;mdash;"historical Israel". The real subjects for history-writing in the modern period are either this historical Israel or else the biblical Israel, the first a historical reality and the second an intellectual creation of the biblical authors. Linked with this was the observation that modern biblical scholars had concentrated their attentions exclusively on [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and their religious history, while ignoring the fact that these had been only a fairly insignificant part of a wider whole.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36}}

==Important works==
*''In Search of Ancient Israel'' (Philip R. Davies, 1992){{sfn|Davies|1995|p=}}
Davies' book "popularised the scholarly conversation and crystallised the import of the emerging scholarly positions" regarding the history of Israel between the 10th and 6th centuries—in other words, it summarised current research and thinking rather than proposing anything original. It was, nevertheless, a watershed work in that it drew together the new interpretations that were emerging from archaeology: the study of texts, sociology and anthropology. Davies argued that scholars needed to distinguish between the three meanings of the word Israel: the historical ancient kingdom of that name (historical Israel); the idealised Israel of the biblical authors writing in the Persian era and seeking to unify the post-exilic Jerusalem community by creating a common past (biblical Israel); and the Israel that had been created by modern scholars over the past century or so by blending together the first two (which he termed ancient Israel, in recognition of the widespread use of this phrase in scholarly histories). "Ancient Israel", he argued, was especially problematic: biblical scholars ran the risk of placing far too much confidence in their reconstructions through relying too heavily on "biblical Israel", the Bible's highly ideological version of a society that had already ceased to exist when the bulk of the biblical books reached their final form.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=36, 291-292}}

*''The Invention of Ancient Israel'' (Keith Whitelam, 1996){{sfn|Whitelam|1996|p=}}
Subtitled "The Silencing of Palestinian History", Whitelam criticised his peers for their concentration on Israel and Judah to the exclusion of the many other peoples and kingdoms that had existed in Iron Age Palestine. Palestinian history for the period from 13th century BCE to the 2nd century CE had been ignored, and scholars had concentrated instead on political, social, and above all religious developments in the small entity of Israel. This, he argued, supported the contemporary claim to the land of Palestine by the descendants of Israel, while keeping biblical studies in the realm of religion rather than history.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=37}}

*''The Israelites in History and Tradition'' (Niels Peter Lemche, 1998){{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=}}

*''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' ([[Thomas L. Thompson]], 1999){{sfn|Thompson|1999|p=}}
The subtitle of the US edition of ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past|The Mythic Past]]'' was "Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel", a phrase almost guaranteed to cause controversy in America. The European title, ''[[The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past]]'', was perhaps more descriptive of its actual theme: the need to treat the Bible as literature rather than as history—"The Bible's language is not a historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction." This was Thompson's attempt to set the minimalist position before a wider public; it became the cause of a rejoinder by William Dever, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', which in turn led to a bitter public dispute between the two.

==Reception and influence==
The ideas of the minimalists generated considerable controversy during the 1990s and the early part of the 21st century. Some conservative scholars reacted defensively, attempting to show that the details of the Bible were in fact consistent with having been written by contemporaries (against the minimalist claim that they were largely the work of the Persian or Hellenistic periods). A notable work in this camp was Kenneth Kitchen's ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Taking a different approach, ''[[A Biblical History of Israel]]'', by [[Iain Provan]], [[V. Philips Long]], and [[Tremper Longman III]], argued that criterion of distrust set by the minimalists (the Bible should be regarded as unreliable unless directly confirmed by external sources) was unreasonable, and that it should be regarded as reliable unless directly falsified. Avi Hurvitz compared biblical Hebrew with the Hebrew from ancient inscriptions and found it consistent with the period before the Persian period, thus questioning the key minimalist contention that the biblical books were written several centuries after the events they describe.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=38}} [[Takamitsu Muraoka]] also argues against the hypothesis that the entire Hebrew Bible was composed in the Persian period, associated with some minimalists like Davies, countering that there are specifically late Biblical Hebrew features, like some rare plene spellings, that are contained in books dated to the Persian era by minimalists as well, but unusual or absent elsewhere.{{sfn|Muraoka|2006|p=9, n. 2}}

In the scholarly mainstream a growing number see significant contradictions between the Bible's version of history and reality. Some who continue to take the Bible for their framework see it as having less reliability as the level of detail increases. In consequence, the study of Israel's past has now moved beyond the minimalist/maximalist debate. Historians of ancient Israel have adapted their methodologies by relying less on the Bible and more on sociological models and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39, 291}} Scholars such as [[Lester L. Grabbe]] (''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?'', 2007), [[Victor H. Matthews]] (''Studying the Ancient Israelites: A Guide to Sources and Methods'', 2007), and Hans Barstad (''History and the Hebrew Bible'', 2008) simply put the evidence before the reader and explain the issues, rather than attempt to write histories; others such as K.L. Knoll (''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity'', 2001) attempt to include Israel in a broader treatment of Syria-Palestine/Canaan. This is not to say that the ideas of the minimalists are completely adopted in modern study of ancient Israel: Mario Liverani, for example (''Israel's History and the History of Israel'', 2005), accepts that the biblical sources are from the Persian period, but believes that the minimalists have not truly understood that context nor recognised the importance of the ancient sources used by the authors. Thus positions that do not fit either a minimalist or a maximalist position are now being expressed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=39}}

'''Brown waste''' is any [[biodegradable waste]] that is predominantly [[Carbon#Compounds|carbon]] based. The term includes such items as grass cuttings, dry leaves, twigs, hay, paper, sawdust, corn cobs, cardboard, pine needles or cones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostguide.com/ How to Make Compost, a Composting Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon is necessary to [[composting]], which uses a combination of [[green waste]] and brown waste to promote the microbial processes involved in the decomposition process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/organics/Homecompost/ California Integrated Waste Management Board - Home Composting]&lt;/ref&gt; The composting of brown waste [[sustainably]] returns the carbon to the [[carbon cycle]].

In the [[demolition|controlled demolition]] industry, '''building implosion''' is the strategic placing of [[explosive material]] and timing of its detonation so that a structure collapses on itself in a matter of seconds, minimizing the physical damage to its immediate surroundings.  Despite its terminology, building implosion also includes the controlled demolition of other structures, such as [[bridge]]s, [[Chimney|smokestacks]], [[tower]]s, and [[tunnel]]s.

Building implosion (which reduces to seconds a process which could take months or years to achieve by other methods) typically occurs in urban areas and often involves large landmark structures.

The actual use of the term "implosion" to refer to the destruction of a building is a [[misnomer]]. This had been stated of the destruction of [[1515 Tower]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. "What happens is, you use explosive materials in critical structural connections to allow gravity to bring it down."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/taking-down-1515-tower-no-implosion-not-quite-223838.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Radio Network House implosion.ogv|thumb|left|upright|Implosion of Radio Network House, damaged by the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], in the [[Christchurch Central City]]]]
{{Rquote|right|The term "implosion" was coined by my grandmother back in, I guess, the '60s. It's a more descriptive way to explain what we do than "explosion". There ''are'' {{sic}} a series of small explosions, but the building itself isn't erupting outward. It's actually being pulled in on top of itself. What we're really doing is removing specific support columns within the structure and then cajoling the building in one direction or another, or straight down.|[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html Stacy Loizeaux]|[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]], December 1996}}

The term ''building implosion'' can be misleading to [[laymen]]: The technique is not a true [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] phenomenon. A true implosion usually involves a difference between internal (lower) and external (higher) pressure, or inward and outward forces, that is so large that the structure collapses inward into itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In contrast, building implosion techniques do not rely on the difference between internal and external pressure to collapse a structure. Instead, the goal is to induce a [[progressive collapse]] by weakening or removing critical supports, therefore the building can no longer withstand gravity loads and will fail under its own weight{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Numerous small explosives, strategically placed within the structure, are used to catalyze the collapse. [[Nitroglycerin]], [[dynamite]], or other explosives are used to shatter reinforced concrete supports.  [[Shaped charge|Linear shaped charges]] are used to sever steel supports.  These explosives are progressively detonated on supports throughout the structure. Then, explosives on the lower floors initiate the controlled collapse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

A simple structure like a chimney can be prepared for demolition in less than a day. Larger or more complex structures can take up to six months of preparation to remove internal walls and wrap columns with fabric and fencing before firing the explosives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

As part of the [[demolition]] industry, the history of building implosion is tied to the development of [[Explosive material|explosives]] technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One of the earliest documented attempts at building implosion was the 1773 razing of Holy Trinity Cathedral in [[Waterford]], [[Ireland]] with 150 pounds of [[gunpowder]], a huge amount of explosives at the time. The use of [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low velocity explosive]] produced a deafening explosion that instantly reduced the building to rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Dick Grogan | title = Pillars of the church may save the nave | page = 2 | publisher = The Irish Times, City Edition; Home News Section; From the South-East | date = 1997-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th Century saw the erection of&amp;nbsp;— and ultimately the need to demolish&amp;nbsp;— the first [[skyscraper]]s, which had more complicated structures, allowing greater heights.  This led to other considerations in the explosive demolition of buildings, such as worker and spectator safety and limiting collateral damage. Benefiting from the availability of [[dynamite]], a high-velocity explosive based on a stabilized form of [[nitroglycerine]], and borrowing from techniques used in rock-blasting, such as staggered detonation of several small charges, building demolition edged toward efficient building implosion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Following [[World War II]], European demolition experts, faced with huge reconstruction projects in dense urban areas, gathered practical knowledge and experience for bringing down large structures without harming adjacent properties.&lt;ref name=HEDA&gt;
{{cite conference | author = Brent Blanchard | title = A History of Explosive Demolition in America | booktitle = Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique | pages = 27–44 |date=February 2002 | issn = 0732-619X | publisher = International Society of Explosives Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the emergence of a demolition industry that grew and matured during the latter half of the twentieth century.  At the same time, the development of more efficient high-velocity explosives, such as [[RDX]], and non-electrical firing systems combined to make this a period of time in which the building implosion technique was extensively used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Meanwhile, public interest in the spectacle of controlled building explosion also grew.  The October 1994 demolition of the Sears Merchandise Center in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] drew a cheering crowd of 50,000, as well as protesters, bands, and street vendors hawking building implosion memorabilia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}   Evolution in the mastery of controlled demolition led to the world record&lt;ref name="HEDA" /&gt; demolition of the [[Seattle Kingdome]] on March 26, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Controlled Demolition, Inc. | title = Seattle Kingdome demolition | url  = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/sites/default/files/kingdome.mpg | accessdate = 2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Royal Canberra Hospital implosion]] in Canberra, Australia experienced disaster. The main building did not fully disintegrate and had to be manually demolished. Far worse, the explosion was not contained on the site and large pieces of debris were projected towards spectators 500 metres away, in a location considered safe for viewing. A twelve-year-old girl was killed instantly, and nine others were injured. Large fragments of masonry and metal were found 650 metres from the demolition site.&lt;ref name="Coronersintro"&gt;{{cite web | last = Madden (ACT Coroner) | first = Shane G. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1999 | url = http://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/dec/bender/Sect01.htm | archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090609035707/http://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/dec/bender/Sect01.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-06-09 | title = General Chronology and Overview | work = The Bender Coronial Decision | publisher = ACT Magistrates Court and Tribunals (Coroner's Court) | accessdate = 2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 1998, the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition]] became the tallest, and the largest, building ever imploded.

On December 13, 2009, an unfinished 31-story condominium tower, known as the [[Ocean Tower]], was imploded in [[South Padre Island, Texas]]. Construction on the new tower had begun in 2006, but it had been sinking unevenly during construction, halted in 2008, and could not be saved.  It is believed to be one of the tallest reinforced concrete structures ever imploded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5b3_1261953820 LiveLeak.com - Tallest reinforced concrete structure ever imploded] [[liveleak.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/rubble-106263-family-span.html Ocean Tower implodes into pile of rubble] - [[The Brownsville Herald]], December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building implosion has been successfully used at Department of Energy sites such as the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina and the Hanford Site in Washington. The SRS 185-3K or "K" Area Cooling Tower, built in 1992 to cool the water from the K Reactor, was no longer needed when the Cold War ended and was safely demolished by explosive demolition on May 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/21-EFCOG%20Best%20Practice%20003_185-3K%20Cooling%20Tower%20Demolition%20-%20Final.pdf The Use of Explosives to Demolish the 185-3K Cooling Tower ](D&amp;D KM-IT Best Practice)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hanford Site Buildings 337, 337B, and the 309 Exhaust Stack, built in the early 1970s  and vacated in the mid-2000s due to deteriorating physical condition, were safely razed by explosive demolition on October 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/18-FINAL_337%20Building%20Explosion%20Demolition_BP.pdf Explosive Demolition of Buildings 337, 337B and the 309 Stack at the Hanford’s 300 Area ](D&amp;D KM-IT Best Practice)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17322">{{About|the competition equations|the predator-prey equations|Lotka–Volterra equations}}

The '''competitive Lotka–Volterra equations''' are a simple model of the [[population dynamics]] of species competing for some common resource.  They can be further [[Generalized Lotka–Volterra equation|generalised]] to include trophic interactions.

==Overview==
The form is similar to the [[Lotka–Volterra equations]] for predation in that the equation for each species has one term for self-interaction and one term for the interaction with other species.  In the equations for predation, the base population model is [[exponential function|exponential]].  For the competition equations, the [[Logistic function#Logistic differential equation|logistic equation]] is the basis.

The logistic population model, when used by [[ecology|ecologists]] often takes the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;{dx \over dt} = rx\left(1-{x \over K}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''x'' is the size of the population at a given time, ''r'' is inherent per-capita growth rate, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]].

===Two species===
Given two populations, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with logistic dynamics, the Lotka–Volterra formulation adds an additional term to account for the species' interactions.  Thus the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;{dx_1 \over dt} = r_1x_1\left(1-\left({x_1+\alpha_{12}x_2 \over K_1}\right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{dx_2 \over dt} = r_2x_2\left(1-\left({x_2+\alpha_{21}x_1 \over K_2}\right) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 2 has on the population of species 1 and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 1 has on the population of species 2.  These values do not have to be equal.  Because this is the competitive version of the model, all interactions must be harmful (competition) and therefore all ''α''-values are positive.  Also, note that each species can have its own growth rate and carrying capacity. A complete classification of this dynamics, even for all sign patterns of above coefficients, is available,&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Bomze|I. Bomze]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: a two-dimensional classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 48, 201–211 (1983); [[Immanuel Bomze|I. Bomze]], Lotka–Volterra equation and replicator dynamics: new issues in classification. ''Biological Cybernetics'' 72, 447–453 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; which is based upon equivalence to the 3-type [[replicator equation]].

===''N'' species===
This model can be generalized to any number of species competing against each other.  One can think of the populations and growth rates as [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] and the interaction ''α'''s as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  Then the equation for any species ''i'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_i}{dt} = r_i x_i \left(1- \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}x_j}{K_i} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

or, if the carrying capacity is pulled into the interaction matrix (this doesn't actually change the equations, only how the interaction matrix is defined),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_i}{dt} = r_i x_i \left( 1 - \sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}x_j \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the total number of interacting species.  For simplicity all self-interacting terms ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt; are often set to 1.

===Possible dynamics===
The definition of a competitive Lotka-Volterra system assumes that all values in the interaction matrix are positive or 0 (''α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 0 for all ''i,j'').  If it is also assumed that the population of any species will increase in the absence of competition unless the population is already at the carrying capacity (''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 for all ''i''), then some definite statements can be made about the behavior of the system.

# The populations of all species will be bounded between 0 and 1 at all times (0 ≤ ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ 1, for all ''i'') as long as the populations started out positive.
# Smale&lt;ref&gt;S. Smale, J. Math. Biol. '''3''', 5., 1976&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Lotka-Volterra systems that meet the above conditions and have five or more species (''N'' ≥ 5) can exhibit any [[Asymptote|asymptotic]] behavior, including a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a [[limit cycle]], an [[Torus|''n''-torus]], or [[Chaotic attractor|attractors]].
# Hirsch&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. '''16''', 423., 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, Nonlinearity '''1''', 51., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Hirsch, SIAM J. Math. Anal. '''21''', 1225., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; proved that all of the dynamics of the attractor occur on a [[manifold]] of dimension ''N''-1.  This essentially says that the attractor cannot have [[dimension]] greater than ''N''-1.  This is important because a limit cycle cannot exist in fewer than two dimensions, an ''n''-torus cannot exist in less than ''n'' dimensions, and chaos cannot occur in less than three dimensions.  So, Hirsch proved that competitive Lotka–Volterra systems cannot exhibit a limit cycle for ''N'' &lt; 3, or any [[torus]] or chaos for ''N'' &lt; 4.  This is still in agreement with Smale that any dynamics can occur for ''N'' ≥ 5.
#*More specifically, Hirsch showed there is an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] set ''C'' that is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the (''N''-1)-dimensional [[simplex]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{N-1} = \left \{ x_i : x_i \ge 0, \sum x_i = 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and is a global attractor of every point excluding the origin.  This carrying simplex contains all of the asymptotic dynamics of the system.
# To create a stable ecosystem the α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; matrix must have all positive eigenvalues.  For large N systems Lotka-Volterra models are either unstable or have low connectivity.  Kondoh&lt;ref&gt;Kondoh M Science 299, 1388 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ackland and Gallagher&lt;ref&gt;Ackland GJ and Gallagher ID Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 158701 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; have independently shown that large, stable Lotka-Volterra systems arise if the elements of  α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. the features of the species) can evolve in accordance with natural selection.

==4-dimensional example==
[[Image:4D competitive LV color.png|thumb|right|350px|The competitive Lotka–Volterra system plotted in [[phase space]] with the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; value represented by the color.]]

A simple 4-Dimensional example of a competitive Lotka–Volterra system has been characterized by Vano ''et al.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vano, J.A., Wildenberg, J.C., Anderson, M.B., Noel, J.K., Sprott, J.C. Chaos in low-dimensional
Lotka--Volterra models of competition. Nonlinearity, 19, 2391--
2404&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the growth rates and interaction matrix have been set to

:&lt;math&gt;r = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0.72 \\ 1.53 \\ 1.27 \end{bmatrix} \quad \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} 1  &amp; 1.09 &amp; 1.52 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.44 &amp; 1.36 \\ 2.33 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.47 \\ 1.21 &amp; 0.51 &amp; 0.35 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;K_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. This system is chaotic and has a largest [[Lyapunov exponent]] of 0.0203.  From the theorems by Hirsch, it is one of the lowest-dimensional chaotic competitive Lotka–Volterra systems.  The Kaplan–Yorke dimension, a measure of the dimensionality of the attractor, is 2.074.  This value is not a whole number, indicative of the [[fractal]] structure inherent in a [[strange attractor]].  The coexisting [[equilibrium point]], the point at which all derivatives are equal to zero but that is not the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], can be found by [[Invertible matrix|inverting]] the interaction matrix and [[Matrix multiplication|multiplying]] by the unit [[column vector]], and is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = \left ( \alpha \right )^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.3013 \\ 0.4586 \\ 0.1307 \\ 0.3557 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there are always 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; equilibrium points, but all others have at least one species' population equal to zero.

The [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] of the system at this point are 0.0414±0.1903''i'', -0.3342, and -1.0319.  This point is unstable due to the positive value of the real part of the [[Complex number|complex]] eigenvalue pair.  If the real part were negative, this point would be stable and the orbit would attract asymptotically.  The transition between these two states, where the real part of the complex eigenvalue pair is equal to zero, is called a [[Hopf bifurcation]].

A detailed study of the parameter dependence of the dynamics was performed by Roques and Chekroun in.&lt;ref name="L.Roques 2011"&gt;L.Roques, and M.D. Chekroun (2011): Probing chaos and biodiversity in a simple competition model, Ecological Complexity, 8 (1), 98--104.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The authors observed that interaction and growth parameters leading respectively to extinction of three species, or coexistence of two, three or four species, are for the most part arranged in large regions with clear boundaries. As predicted by the theory, chaos was also found; taking place however over much smaller islands of the parameter space which makes difficult the identification of their location by a random search algorithm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These regions where chaos occurs are, in the three cases analyzed  in,&lt;ref name="L.Roques 2011"/&gt; situated at the interface between a non-chaotic four species region and a region where extinction occurs. This implies a high sensitivity of biodiversity with respect to parameter variations in the chaotic regions. Additionally, in regions where extinction occurs which are adjacent to chaotic regions, the computation of local Lyapunov exponents &lt;ref&gt;Nese, J.M., 1989. Quantifying local predictability in phase space. Physica D 35,237--250.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that a possible cause of extinction is the overly strong fluctuations in species abundances induced by local chaos.

==Spatial arrangements==
[[Image:Competitive LV Spatial Bee Example.JPG|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of spatial structure in nature. The strength of the interaction between bee colonies is a function of their proximity. Colonies ''A'' and ''B'' interact, as do colonies ''B'' and ''C''. ''A'' and ''C'' do not interact directly, but affect each other through colony ''B''.]]

===Background===
There are many situations where the strength of species' interactions depends on the physical distance of separation.  Imagine bee colonies in a field.  They will compete for food strongly with the colonies located near to them, weakly with further colonies, and not at all with colonies that are far away.  This doesn't mean, however, that those far colonies can be ignored.  There is a [[Transitive relation|transitive]] effect that permeates through the system.  If colony ''A'' interacts with colony ''B'', and ''B'' with ''C'', then ''C'' affects ''A'' through ''B''.  Therefore, if the competitive Lotka–Volterra equations are to be used for modeling such a system, they must incorporate this spatial structure.

===Matrix organization===
One possible way to incorporate this spatial structure is to modify the nature of the Lotka–Volterra equations to something like a 
[[reaction-diffusion system]].  It is much easier, however, to keep the format of the equations the same and instead modify the interaction matrix.  For simplicity, consider a five species example where all of the species are aligned on a circle, and each interacts only with the two neighbors on either side with strength ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.  Thus, species 3 interacts only with species 2 and 4, species 1 interacts only with species 2 and 5, etc.  The interaction matrix will now be

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} \\ \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

If each species is identical in its interactions with neighboring species, then each row of the matrix is just a [[permutation]] of the first row.  A simple, but non-realistic, example of this type of system has been characterized by Sprott ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Sprott, J.C., Wildenberg, J.C., Azizi, Y. A simple spatiotemporal chaotic Lotka–Volterra model. Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals '''26''', 1035., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The coexisting [[equilibrium point]] for these systems has a very simple form given by the [[Inverse element|inverse]] of the sum of the row

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}_i = \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_{ij}} = \frac{1}{\alpha_{-1} + 1 + \alpha_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lyapunov functions===
A [[Lyapunov function]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the system ''f'' = ''f''(''x'') whose existence in a system demonstrates [[Lyapunov stability|stability]].  It is often useful to imagine a Lyapunov function as the energy of the system.  If the derivative of the function is equal to zero for some [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] not including the [[equilibrium point]], then that orbit is a stable [[attractor]], but it must be either a limit cycle or ''n''-torus - but not a [[strange attractor]] (this is because the largest [[Lyapunov exponent]] of a limit cycle and ''n''-torus are zero while that of a strange attractor is positive).  If the derivative is less than zero everywhere except the equilibrium point, then the equilibrium point is a stable fixed point attractor.  When searching a [[dynamical system]] for non-fixed point attractors, the existence of a Lyapunov function can help eliminate regions of parameter space where these dynamics are impossible.

The spatial system introduced above has a Lyapunov function that has been explored by Wildenberg ''et al.''&lt;ref name = Wildenberg&gt;Wildenberg, J.C., Vano, J.A., Sprott, J.C. Complex spatiotemporal dynamics in Lotka–Volterra ring systems. Ecological Complexity '''3''', 140. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  If all species are identical in their spatial interactions, then the interaction matrix is [[circulant matrix|circulant]].  The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix are given by&lt;ref&gt;Hofbauer, J., [[Karl Sigmund|Sigmund, K.]], 1988. The Theory of Evolution and Dynamical Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_k = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} c_j\gamma^{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' = 0&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = e^{i2\pi/N}&lt;/math&gt; the ''N''th [[root of unity]].  Here ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''j''th value in the first row of the circulant matrix.

The Lyapunov function exists if the real part of the eigenvalues are positive (Re(''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 for ''k'' = 0,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''N''/2).  Consider the system where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'', ''α''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b'', ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'', and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''.  The Lyapunov function exists if

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\lambda_k) = \operatorname{Re} \left ( 1+\alpha_{-2}e^{i2 \pi k(N-2)/N}+\alpha_{-1}e^{i2 \pi k(N-1)/N}+\alpha_1e^{i2 \pi k/N}+\alpha_2e^{i4 \pi k/N} \right )&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= 1+(\alpha_{-2}+\alpha_2)\cos \left ( \frac{i4 \pi k}{N} \right ) + (\alpha_{-1}+\alpha_1)\cos \left ( \frac{i2 \pi k}{N} \right ) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for k = 0,&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;,''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.  Now, instead of having to integrate the system over thousands of time steps to see if any dynamics other than a fixed point attractor exist, one need only determine if the Lyapunov function exists (note: the absence of the Lyapunov function doesn't guarantee a limit cycle, torus, or chaos).

Example: Let ''α''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.451, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5, and ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.237.  If ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5 then all eigenvalues are negative and the only attractor is a fixed point.  If ''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.852 then the real part of one of the complex eigenvalue pair becomes positive and there is a strange attractor.  The disappearance of this Lyapunov function coincides with a [[Hopf bifurcation]].

===Line systems and eigenvalues===
[[Image:Competitive LV Spatial Eigenvalues.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The eigenvalues of a circle, short line, and long line plotted in the complex plane]]

It is also possible to arrange the species into a line.&lt;ref name=Wildenberg/&gt;  The interaction matrix for this system is very similar to that of a circle except the interaction terms in the lower left and upper right of the matrix are deleted (those that describe the interactions between species 1 and ''N'', etc.).

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 &amp; \alpha_1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \alpha_{-1} &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This change eliminates the Lyapunov function described above for the system on a circle, but most likely there are other Lyapunov functions that have not been discovered.

The eigenvalues of the circle system plotted in the [[complex plane]] form a [[trefoil]] shape.  The eigenvalues from a short line form a sideways Y, but those of a long line begin to resemble the trefoil shape of the circle.  This could be due to the fact that a long line is indistinguishable from a circle to those species far from the ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">The theory of convergence-divergence zones &lt;ref&gt; Kaspar Meyer, Antonio Damasio, Convergence and divergence in a neural architecture for recognition and memory, Trends in Neurosciences Vol.32 No.7, (2009) 376-382&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Damasio, Time-locked multiregional retroactivation: A systems-level proposal for the neural substrates of recall and recognition, Cognition, 33 (1989) 25-62&lt;/ref&gt;was proposed by [[Antonio Damasio]], in 1989, to explain the neural mechanisms of recollection. It also helps to explain other forms of [[consciousness]]: creative [[imagination]], [[thought]], the formation of beliefs and motivations ...

It is based on two key assumptions: imagination is a simulation of [[perception]], brain registrations of memories are self-excitatory neural networks (neurons can activate each other). 

== Definition ==
A '''convergence-divergence zone''' (CDZ) is a neural network which receives convergent projections from the sites whose activity is to be recorded, and which returns divergent projections to the same sites. When an experiment is recorded, the signals that converge on the CDZ excite their neurons which strengthen their mutual connections (according to the [[Hebbian theory]]) and thus form a self-excitatory network. The excitation of this network is then enough to reproduce the combination of initially received signals. In a self-excitatory network the excitation of a part spreads to all the others, just like a memory fragment awakens an entire recorded experience. A CDZ is thus the place of recording and reproduction of memories. It is both a detector and a signal producer (forms of neuronal activation). This is the basic neural mechanism that explains memories and other forms of imagination.

== Arborescences of CDZ ==
In addition to convergent-divergent paths, a CDZ may be connected to the rest of the brain in every imaginable way, by input signals that activate or inhibit it, and output signals with which it influences the rest of the system. In particular CDZs may be organized into a system and form an arborescence. A CDZ may recruit converging input channels from many other CDZs. It can thus make a synthesis of detection and production capabilities of all the CDZs thus recruited.

To make a model of the CDZ system, we distinguish in the nervous system a peripheral part and a central one, with a gradual progression from the periphery to the center. The periphery includes all sources of perception: the feeling of the outside and inside, emotions and actions. The periphery, thus understood, includes all cortical sensory, emotional and motor areas, and all intracerebral nuclei that contribute to their functioning.

The CDZ system is organized in a hierarchical fashion, from the periphery to the center. The most peripheral CDZs have convergent paths directly from the periphery. We approach the center going up the arborescence of CDZs. One can think of roots that plunge into the earth, the periphery, and converge to the base of the trunk, the center. But in the brain, there are a large number of centers. The most central CDZs have converging projections from other CDZs, and are not recruited by a more central CDZ. The memory of an episode of our life is preserved in such central CDZs. When we relive the perceptions, emotions and actions of a past experience, the excitation of this central CDZs activates all subordinated CDZs and the peripheral areas. It thereby reconstructs the previously lived experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">A '''critical system''' is a system which must be highly reliable and retain this [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] as they evolve without incurring prohibitive costs.&lt;ref name=lorcan&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Mike | last1 = Hinchey | first2 = Lorcan | last2 = Coyle | url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/2085/2010_Hinchey,M.pdf?sequence=2 | title = Evolving Critical Systems: a Research Agenda for Computer-Based Systems | pages = 430-435| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four types of critical systems: [[safety critical]], [[mission critical]], [[business critical]] and [[security critical]].&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

==General description==

For such systems, trusted methods and techniques must be used for development. Consequently, critical systems are usually developed using well-tested techniques rather than newer techniques that have not been subject to extensive practical experience. Developers of critical systems are naturally conservative, preferring to use older techniques whose strengths and weaknesses are understood, rather than new techniques which may appear to be better, but whose long-term problems are unknown.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

Expensive software engineering techniques that are not cost-effective for non-critical systems may sometimes be used for critical systems development. For example, [[Formal methods|formal mathematical methods]] of software development have been successfully used for safety and security critical systems. One reason why these formal methods are used is that it helps reduce the amount of testing required. For critical systems, the costs of [[Verification and validation|verification]] and validation are usually very high—more than 50% of the total system development costs.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;

==Classification==

A critical system is distinguished by the consequences associated with system or function failure. Likewise, critical systems are further distinguished between fail-operational and fail safe systems, according to the tolerance they must exhibit to failures:&lt;ref name=marco&gt;{{cite book|first1=Marco|last1=Bozzano|first2=Adolfo|last2=Villafiorita|title=Design and Safety Assessment of Critical Systemss|location=Austin, Texas|year=2010|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Design-and-Safety-Assessment-of-Critical-Systems/Bozzano-Villafiorita/p/book/9781439803318|pages=298|isbn=9781439803318|publisher=Auerbach Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fail-operational — typically required to operate not only in nominal conditions (expected), but also in degraded situations when some parts are not working properly. For example, airplanes are fail-operational because they must be able to fly even if some components fail.
* Fail-safe — must safely shut down in case of single or multiple failures. Trains are fail-safe systems because stopping a train is typically sufficient to put into safe state.

===Safety critical===
{{main|Life-critical system}}
''Safety critical'' systems deal with scenarios that may lead to loss of life, serious personal injury, or damage to the natural environment. Examples of safety-critical systems are a control system for a chemical manufacturing plant, aircraft, the controller of an unmanned train metro system, a controller of a nuclear plant, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Critical vs. Business Critical: HUH?|url=http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/03/mission-critical-vs-business-critical-applications-huh|website=Activestate ActiveBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Mission critical===
{{main|Mission critical}}
''Mission critical'' systems are made to avoid inability to complete the overall system, project objectives or one of the goals for which the system was designed. Examples of mission-critical systems are a navigational system for a spacecraft, software controlling a [[baggage handling system]] of an airport, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Business critical===
''Business critical'' systems are programmed to avoid significant tangible or intangible economic costs; e.g., loss of business or damage to reputation. This is often due to the interruption of service caused by the system being unusable. Examples of a business-critical systems are the customer accounting system in a bank, stock-trading system, [[ERP system]] of a company, Internet search engine, etc.&lt;ref name=s2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;&lt;ref name=marco /&gt;

===Security critical===
''Security critical'' systems deal with the loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss.&lt;ref name=lorcan /&gt;

'''Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' or '''Old Croatian Art''' is [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]] [[Art of Croatia|of Croats]] from their arrival at [[Balkans]] till the end of the 11th century when begins the dominance of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style in art; that was the time of Croatian rulers ([[Dukes of Croatia|Croatian dukes]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]]).

==Historical background==
{{main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Dolazak Hrvata Celestin Medović.JPG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Celestin Medović]], ''[[Arrival of Croats]]'', before 1920, [[Croatian History Institute]], [[Zagreb]].]]
[[Croats]] have moved from northern Europe, together with other Slavs and Avars, to the area of former Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they live til the present day. There they founded several [[principality|principalities]]: [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] in the north around the river [[Sava]], and [[Dalmatian Croatia]] along the western and southern [[Adriatic]] coast. Together they were known as [[White Croatia]], while to the east there were [[medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia]] which were at times collectively called [[Red Croatia]].

Croats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn’t know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Art of Early Medieval Croatia at culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt; Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century.

[[File:Branimir.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with the inscription of [[duke Branimir]]’s name from year 880.]]
First Croatian ruler that was recognized by the [[pope]] was [[duke Branimir]], who was called by pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] ''dux Chroatorum'' in his letter in 879.
First king of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] from the [[House of Trpimirović]] was crowned around year 925 as ''rex Chroatorum'' and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country  which peaked during the reign of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058-1074).

During the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Biograd na Moru]] and [[Knin]]. Other bigger cities were [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Krk]], [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized.

After the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimirović in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the [[Hungarian Kingdom|Hungarian]] king [[Coloman]] as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and [[Hungary]], stated by the deal ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta Conventa]]'' from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style.

==Old Croatian architecture==

[[File:Zadar Sankt Donat 04.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of St. Donatus]] from the 9th century in Zadar]]
During 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms.

[[File:Crkva sv. trojice.jpg|thumb|150px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of Three Saints]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (9th-11th century)]]
From this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near [[Omiš]] and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s, [[apse]]s and [[dome]]s, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Radovan Ivančević from Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller churches are called “churches of free shapes”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art (Hr)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omiš) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing ([[Church of Saint Cross]] in Nin).&lt;ref name="culturenet1"&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Church of St. Mihailo.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The Church of St. Michael in [[Ston]] from 1080, a foundation of [[Duklja|Doclea]] king [[Mihailo Voislav]].]] --&gt;
[[File:Crikva sveti Dunat 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Church of St. Donatus on the island of [[Krk]].]]
The most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. [[Church of St. Three]] in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in Ošlje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is ''[[Church of St. Donatus]]'' in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne’s ''[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]'' that can be compared with its size and beauty.

Large churches often have one or three naves, like ''[[St. Saviour, Cetina]]'' from the 9th century which has rounded [[buttress]]es and a [[bell tower]] above the western portal ([[westwork]]).

In the 10th century Croatian queen [[Jelena of Zadar]], the wife of king [[Mihajlo Krešimir II]], built in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] two churches: [[Church of St. Stephen of the Island]] which was used as a royal mausoleum, and [[Church of Our Lady of the Island]], one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown [[basilica]]. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a [[narthex]]&lt;ref&gt;In its ruins was found famous sepulchral tablet of queen Jelena († 976) in which was stated that she was "widow of king Michael, mother of Stephan the king". http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089&lt;/ref&gt; which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave.

In the 11th century, next to older “Church on the Hill” in Solin, [[Crown church of St. Peter and Moses]] (better known as “[[Hollow church]]“) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian [[Dmitar Zvonimir]].

In northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in [[Sisak]], the capital of [[Ljudevit Posavski]]. When the bishopric was founded in [[Zagreb]] (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence.

==Sculptural ornaments==

[[File:10cent pleter Drzislav.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with inscription of king [[Stjepan Držislav]] from the 10th century.]][[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|mini|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Baška tablet]], the most famous glagolitic monument written with transversal type of glagolitic script from the 11th century.]]

Pre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke [[Trpimir]] (''PRO DVCE TREPIMERO''), from around year 850, while on the inscription of [[duke Branimir]] from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: ''CRVATORVM''. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes [[Muncimir of Croatia]], [[Držislav]] and [[Svetislav]], all the way to [[king Zvonimir]] from the end of the 11th century.
That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in [[Croatian language]], written in [[Glagolitic script]] ([[Baška tablet]]).

Double literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as [[Plomin tablet]] (Istria) and [[Valun tablet]] ([[Cres]], 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast.&lt;ref name="culturenet1"/&gt;

[[File:Reljef splitska krstionica.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Baptistery with figure of Croatian king from the 11th century; now in the [[Split Cathedral]].]][[File:Plomin tablet 1.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[Plomin tablet]]]]
Altar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call [[Croatian interlace]]. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in [[Lobor]] and one in [[Ilok]].&lt;ref&gt;Radovan Ivančević, ''Umjetnost razdoblja život I.'', Profil, Zagreb, 2001, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of [[king Zvonimir]] in Solin with the figure of ''(Croatian) king'' on the throne with [[Franks|Frankish crown]], beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral.

In church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near [[Knin]] the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Soldo: History of Church in Croatia, Zagreb-Frankfurt/M., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Romanesque painting in Croatia==

Croatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimirović dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above [[Kaštel Sućurac]]) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting.

[[File:Fresco of Mihailo Vojislavljević, njegos.org.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of [[Mihailo I of Duklja]], the first recognized ruler of Duklja on a fresco in the ''Church of St. Michael'' in ''[[Ston]]''.]]
The only preserved paintings are found in the [[church of St. Michael near Ston]] from the 11th century . They were ordered by [[Duklja|Doclea]]n ruler [[Mihailo Vojislav]], and were a work of local artist who with rough form and primitive materials achieved strong and suggestive expression in portrayed characters. The figure of a king that holds a model of a church has the same crown as the king depicted in the relief in Split baptistery. His portrait is also remarkable, it shows bony person with high eyebrows and wrinkled forehead, while his long hair and beard are already partly gray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately significant number of church [[codex|codices]] were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s of high quality and technique. The oldest one is [[Split Breviary]] that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre-Carolingian era. In [[Zagreb]] there is a [[Liber psalmorum]] which was illuminated in [[Benedictine]] style by [[prior]] Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015–1030). In [[Vatican City|Vatican]] there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]] and [[Dubrovnik]] but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.

'''Ecological land classification''' is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes.

==Concept==
The expression "ecological land classification" as understood in this article, is approximate with the biogeographical and ecological regionalisations in a scientific context (see [[biogeography#biogeographic units|biogeographic units]]).

However, its actual usage is more approximate with a tool used for [[land management]], in the context of [[environmental resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.R. 1981. ''Ecological land classification terrestrial subsystem: a basic inventory system for planning and management on the Mark Twain National Forest''. USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region. 56 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AOGkpcqyS44C].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, J. C., Bestelmeyer, B. T., McClaran, M. P., Robinett, D., Briske, D. D., Wu, X. B., &amp; Fernández-Giménez, M. E. (2016). Can ecological land classification increase the utility of vegetation monitoring data?. ''Ecological Indicators'' 69: 657-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Wicken, E. B. 1986. ''Terrestrial ecozones of Canada. Environment Canada''. Ecological Land Classification Series No. 19. Lands Directorate, Ottawa. 26 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define [[ecological unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LUEPS/Publication/264779.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosim.ca/ELCWebApp/ecological_land_classification/ELC_eTool.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Many different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Part of the list proposed below is inspired by [[Miklos Udvardy]] ''classification of the Biographical Provinces in the World'' which was prepared by Unesco's Man and the Biosphere program, published in 1975 and updated in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udvardy, M. D. F. (1975). ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world''. IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18. Morges, Switzerland: IUCN, [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/udvardy.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcap-sk.org/docs/6_skecositeguide/Ecoregions_and_Ecosites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Biogeography]] - Biogeographical provinces take into account both flora and fauna.
*[[Phytogeography]] - from Greek words phyto = [[plant]] and [[geography]] meaning also distribution, concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant species]].
*[[Botany]] - botanists have identified [[floristic province]]s based on [[flora]]-[[plant community|plant communities]]
*[[Zoology]] - zoologists have identified zoogeographic provinces based on [[fauna]]l communities.
*[[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] - approximating ecosystem capacity and potentials.
*[[Geology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)]] - the physical matter and energy that constitute the Earth.

=== Approaches to classifications===

American geographer [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]] defines a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of {{convert|10|km2|0}} in area), through meso-ecosystems ([[landscape ecology|landscape mosaics]], in the order of {{convert|1000|km2|-2}}) to macro-ecosystems ([[ecoregions]], in the order of {{convert|100000|km2|-4}}).&lt;ref name="BaileyCh2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=25-28|chapter=Chapter 2}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: ''[[Holism|gestalt]]'' ("a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts"), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like [[geology]], [[landform]]s and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; [[Cluster analysis|multivariate clustering]] of site attributes; [[digital image processing]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data grouping areas based on their appearance or other [[Multispectral image|spectral]] properties; or by a "controlling factors method" where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation [[physiognomy]] or the [[species distribution|distribution]] of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems.&lt;ref name="BaileyCh3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=29–40|chapter=Chapter 3}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast with Bailey's methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist [[Ariel Lugo]] and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on [[georeference]]d, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A.

[[Image:analytic.svg|thumb|300px|right|A signal in blue and the magnitude of its [[analytic signal]] in red, showing the envelope effect]]

An '''envelope detector''' is an electronic circuit that takes a (relatively) high-frequency amplitude modulated  signal as input and provides an output which is the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the original signal.

==Circuit operation==
The [[capacitor]] in the circuit above stores charge on the rising edge and releases it slowly through the [[resistor]] when the input signal amplitude falls. The diode in series [[Rectifier|rectifies]] the incoming signal, allowing current flow only when the positive input terminal is at a higher potential than the negative input terminal.

==General considerations ==
Most practical envelope detectors use either half-wave or full-wave [[Rectifier|rectification]] of the signal to convert the [[Alternating current|AC]] audio input into a pulsed [[Direct current|DC]] signal. [[Electronic filter|Filtering]] is then used to smooth the final result. This filtering is rarely perfect and some "ripple" is likely to remain on the envelope follower output, particularly for low frequency inputs such as notes from a bass instrument. Reducing the filter cutoff frequency gives a smoother output, but decreases the high frequency response. Therefore, practical designs must reach a compromise.

== Definition of the envelope ==
Any [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[frequency modulation|FM]] signal &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the following form
: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = R(t) \cos ( \omega t + \varphi(t) ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of AM, φ(''t'') (the phase component of the signal) is constant and can be ignored. In AM, the [[carrier frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is also constant. Thus, all the information in the AM signal is in ''R''(''t''). ''R''(''t'') is called the '''envelope''' of the signal. Hence an AM signal is given by the function
: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = (C + m(t)) \cos(\omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''m''(''t'') representing the original audio frequency message, ''C'' the carrier amplitude and ''R''(''t'') equal to ''C'' + ''m''(''t''). So, if the envelope of the AM signal can be extracted, the original message can be recovered.

In the case of FM, the transmitted &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; has a [[constant envelope]] ''R''(''t'') = R and can be ignored.
However, many FM receivers measure the envelope anyway for [[received signal strength indication]].

== Diode detector ==
The simplest form of envelope detector is the '''[[diode detector]]''' which is shown above. A diode detector is simply a [[diode]] between the input and output of a circuit, connected to a resistor and capacitor in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit should approximate a voltage-shifted version of the original ([[baseband]]) signal. A simple filter can then be applied to filter out the DC component.

== Precision detector ==
An envelope detector can also be constructed to use a '''[[precision rectifier]]''' feeding into a [[low-pass filter]].

== Drawbacks ==
The envelope detector has several drawbacks:
* The input to the detector must be [[band-pass filter]]ed around the desired signal, or else the detector will simultaneously demodulate several signals. The filtering can be done with a tunable filter or, more practically, a [[superheterodyne receiver]]
* It is more susceptible to noise than a [[product detector]]
* If the signal is [[overmodulation|overmodulated]], distortion will occur
Most of these drawbacks are relatively minor and are usually acceptable tradeoffs for the simplicity and low cost of using an envelope detector.

== Demodulation of signals ==
An envelope detector can be used to [[demodulate]] a previously modulated signal by removing all high frequency components of the signal. The capacitor and resistor form a low-pass filter to filter out the carrier frequency. Such a device is often used to demodulate AM radio signals because the envelope of the modulated signal is equivalent to the [[baseband]] signal.

== Audio ==
{{also|Noise gate#Trance gating}}
An envelope detector is sometimes referred to as an '''envelope follower''' in [[music]]al environments. It is still used to detect the [[amplitude]] variations of an incoming signal to produce a control signal that resembles those variations. However, in this case the input signal is made up of audible frequencies.

Envelope detectors are often a component of other circuits, such as a [[Audio level compression|compressor]] or an [[auto-wah]] or envelope-followed filter. In these circuits, the envelope follower is part of what is known as the "[[Side chain (sound)|side chain]]", a circuit which describes some characteristic of the input, in this case its volume.

Both [[Dynamic range compression|expanders]] and [[Audio level compression|compressors]] use the envelope's output voltage to control the gain of an amplifier. Auto-wah uses the voltage to control the [[cutoff frequency]] of a filter. The [[voltage-controlled filter]] of an [[analog synthesizer]] is a similar circuit.

Modern envelope followers can be implemented: 
# directly as [[electronic hardware]],
# or as software using either a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) or
# on a general purpose CPU.

The '''Fair Trade Certified Mark''' is a [[fair trade certification]] mark used in Canada and in the United States. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that disadvantaged producers in the developing world are getting a better deal. The Fair Trade Certified Mark is the North American equivalent of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 

For a product to carry either Certification Marks, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]] to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[Fairtrade Canada]] (formerly "TransFair USA" and "TransFair Canada," respectively) licensees can use the Fair Trade Certified Mark on their products, however a gradual phase-out of this mark began in Canada in 2011.

The Canadian Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair Canada]] on the Canadian market in 1997.

The American Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair USA]] on the American market in 1998.

In 2010, Canada began actively promoting both the Fair Trade Certified Mark and the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] as part of a transition process towards the latter, which became the primary Fairtrade Certification Mark in 2011.

In 2012 a variation of the US Fair Trade certification mark was adopted with the benefit of being registered globally as a trade mark. The mark is designed to pop better on the shelf through a far simpler design and the use of color. The one basket with outstretched hands indicates sharing and a "give and take" between producers and purchases. The green signals the environmental strength of Fair Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/sites/all/files/wysiwyg/filemanager/label/Fair-Trade-USA-FAQ-newcertificationmark.pdf|title=Certification Mark: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fair Trade USA|date=|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria''' ([[Linz]], 14 June 1529 &amp;ndash; 24 January 1595, [[Innsbruck]]) was ruler of [[Further Austria]] including [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. The son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he was married to [[Philippine Welser]] in his first marriage. In his second marriage to [[Anna Juliana Gonzaga]], he was the father of [[Anna of Tyrol]], the would-be [[Holy Roman Empress]].

==Life account==
[[Image:William Scrots 002.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke Ferdinand at a young age]][[File:New-reformierte-Landts-Ordnung-der-fürstlichen-Grafschafft-Tyrol-1573 MG 0965.tif|thumb|Engraving of Ferdinand, published in ''New Reformierte Landts-Ordnung Der Fürstlichen Graffschafft Tyrol Wie Die Auss Lands-Fürstlichem Befelch, Im 1603'']]
Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]]. He was a younger brother of Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of [[Bohemia]] in 1547. He also led the campaign against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in [[Hungary]] in 1556.

In 1557 he was secretly married to Philippine [[Welser]], daughter of a patrician from [[Augsburg]], with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name "of Austria" but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of [[Habsburg]] became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a [[morganatic marriage]]. The sons born of this marriage received the title [[Margrave of Burgau]], after the [[Margraviate of Burgau]], an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of ''Fürst zu Burgau''.

After his father's death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] and other [[Further Austria]]n possessions under his father's will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in [[Prague]] until 1567 according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II.

In his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic [[counter-reformation]] would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making [[Castle Ambras|Ambras Castle Innsbruck]] the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle Innsbruck represents an unrivalled cultural monument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The collection was started during Ferdinand's time in Bohemia and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incurred a high level of debt. Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. 

After the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married [[Anna Caterina Gonzaga]], a daughter of [[William I, Duke of Mantua]], in 1582.

Archduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tirol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became [[Anna of Tyrol|Holy Roman Empress Anna]], consort of [[Emperor Mathias]], who received his Further Austrian inheritance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7329">Automatic '''fish counters''' are automatic devices for measuring the number of fish passing along a particular river in a particular period of time. Usually one particular species is of interest.

One important species studied by fish counters are [[Atlantic salmon]]. This species is of interest owing to its ecologically vulnerable status and [[Fish migration|anadromous]] lifestyles.

== Methods of operation ==

Fish counters can be divided into three principal types: resistive counters, optical counters, and hydroacoustic counters.

=== Resistive counters ===

A resistive counter is associated with an in-river structure, an example constituting a Crump weir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunt.de/networks/gunt/sites/s1/mmcontent/produktbilder/07016033/Datenblatt/07016033%202.pdf Crump weir]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[resistivity]] of a fish is lower than that of water. So, as fish cross this barrier, they pass embedded [[electrodes]], and the difference in resistivity disturbs the field established in the vicinity of the electrodes, altering inter-electrode resistance. With three electrodes these disturbances can then be measured by a [[Wheatstone bridge]], or other means, to detect the size and direction of travel of the fish.

Fish counters of this type are used widely in [[Scotland]] to census populations of Atlantic salmon, where comparison with closed circuit television shows around a 97% detection rate.

=== Optical counters ===

An [http://vaki.is/Products/RiverwatcherFishCounter/ optical counter] is also associated with an in-river structure. However, rather than pass electrodes, in an optical counter the fish interrupt some of a number of vertically arranged beams of light. The pattern of beam-breaks can be used to determine the size, profile, and direction of motion of the fish.

Infrared light is used for minimizing the disturbance of the fish as they will not see the light when passing through the counter. When a fish swims through the net of light beams, the resulting silhouette image is used for counting as well as estimating the size of each fish. Each individual image is memorized in the control unit so that the counting can be verified afterwards.

Some systems such as the [http://riverwatcher.is/ Riverwatcher] use the infrared scanner to trigger a digital camera to capture between 1 and 5 photos or a short video clip of each fish. The computer then automatically links the images to other information contained in the database for that individual fish such as size, passing hour, speed, silhouette image, temperature etc.

The camera is installed in a special tunnel that contains both the camera and lights providing constant light, and same distance from the camera for the fish. That way, it is possible to get good images of the fish regardless of time of day.

The performance of optical counters has been determined by studies, under various conditions, to be greater than 90%. Optical counters can also distinguish the size of fish more accurately than other counter types and so are particularly useful where a mixture of species inhabit a river (for example rivers where salmon mix with [[sea trout]]).

The key disadvantage of optical counters is the small penetration of the beams through the water, restricting their use to narrow river features or in-river structures, an example being fish ladders.

=== Hydroacoustic counters ===
Hydroacoustic counters operate using the principles of [[sonar]]. A fish is insonified by a sound source and reflections from the fish are detected by an underwater microphone. The reflection occurs because of the sudden change in impedance to sound waves within the fish, particularly at the [[swimbladder]] (90% of the reflection).

Hydroacoustic counters do not require in-river structures, but require skilled installation and operators. Without skilled installation at ideal sites hydroacoustic counters can be inaccurate. Studies typically indicate detection rates of 50% to 80%, though one study found detection rates as low as 3%. Careful planning and pre-siting study must be used to determine effectiveness.

The lack of a requirement for any in-river structure makes the counters an attractive proposition.  Generally used for short-term or seasonal studies, some situations require a long-term count which is accurate in absolute terms, not only in relative change (for example, no hydroacoustic sensors are routinely used in the detection of Scottish Atlantic salmon).  In these instances resistivity or optical sensors tend to be preferred.  Such methods usually require significant habitat modification, such as construction of a [[Fishing weir|weir]] to funnel the fish through the counter.

Recent advances in automated hydroacoustic monitoring systems has allowed continuous monitoring for periods exceeding 18 months.  These systems include intelligent monitoring and real-time data processing, ensuring proper operation and publication of status and results (e.g. fish counts) on a routine basis.

== Siting counters  ==

=== In river structures ===
Resistivity and (particularly) optical fish counters require in-river structures to direct the fish through the detection aperture of the counter. [[Fish ladder]]s and Borland fish passes are effective structures for this purpose and occasionally a natural restriction within the river may be used for a similar purpose. However, for most counters a custom in-river structure will be required. One of the most effective such structures is the Crump weir, a triangular profile weir designed to ensure rapid planar flow over the detector.

=== Siting within the river system ===
A species of anadromous fish, such as the Atlantic salmon, may return to a particular breeding ground throughout its life. This means that within the larger rivers a number of quite distinct populations may cross a counter together, in aggregate. A population which uses a particular tributary may collapse whilst the overall numbers are not clearly affected. Issues with the management of that particular tributary and population therefore go unnoticed. Counters should be placed to count individual populations, rather than the species in aggregate, in order that population collapses and recoveries can be detected.

== Alternative methods ==
The results of automatic fish counters can be supplemented, confirmed, or replaced by a number of alternative techniques, varying in accuracy, cost, complexity, and skew effects.

In [[drama]], a '''frame''' is a situation or position of importance given to a person, and '''distance''' relates to how engaged the frame makes the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematography|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/cinematography.htm|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
*A [[news reporter|reporter]] would be furthest away from the action as they would be a [[wikt:spectator|spectator]], reporting on events.
*A [[soldier]] or [[policeman]] would be in the action, and is actually within the [[drama]], being closest.

[[Dorothy Heathcote]] created the idea of frames and distance. These concepts can be applied to thinking about a [[target group]] and how willing they would be to interact with the drama. A younger child is more likely to want to become part of the action, while a [[teenager]] is more likely to want to observe and comment on the action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2941">A '''gender expression''' is a person's behavior, mannerisms, interests, and appearance that are associated with [[gender]] in a particular cultural context, specifically with the categories of [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]]. This also includes [[gender role]]s. These categories rely on [[stereotype]]s about gender.
==Defining gender expression==

Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes]|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist|date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

In men and boys, typical gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]]. In girls, atypical expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In (especially queer) women, atypical and typical expression are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]]. A type of expression that is perceived as neither typically feminine or masculine can be described as gender-neutral or undifferentiated.

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating gender expression==

The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] was designed to evaluate gender expression objectively (within a White American cultural context).

The '''High Flux Australian Reactor''' ('''HIFAR''') was Australia's first [[nuclear reactor]]. It was built at the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] (later [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|ANSTO]]) Research Establishment at {{NSWcity|Lucas Heights}}, [[Sydney]]. The reactor was in operation between 1958 and 2007, when it was superseded by the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]], also in Lucas Heights.

==Background and operation==
Based on the [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO reactor]] at [[Harwell]] in the UK, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by [[heavy water]] ([[deuterium oxide|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]), and the fuel was [[enriched uranium]]. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. Like DIDO, its original purpose was nuclear materials testing, using its high neutron flux to give materials intended for use in [[nuclear power reactor]]s their entire expected lifetime neutron exposure in a relatively short period.

HIFAR was used for research, particularly [[neutron diffraction]] experiments, production of neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon, and for production of medical and industrial [[radioisotope]]s.

HIFAR went critical at 11:15 pm local time on 26 January 1958,&lt;ref name="hifar_background"&gt;{{cite press release|author=|title=HIFAR Media Backgrounder|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/6449/HIFAR_Media_Backgrounder.pdf|format=PDF|work=|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first run at full power of {{convert|10|MW}} (thermal) in 1960. The initial fuel was highly enriched uranium, but over the years the enrichment level of new fuel was steadily reduced, in line with international trends designed to reduce the danger of diversion of research reactor fuel for weapons programs. HIFAR completed conversion to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU) in 2006.
Of the six DIDO class reactors built including DIDO itself, HIFAR was the last to cease operation.  Permanent decommissioning of HIFAR commenced on 30 January 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Science Minister turns off nuclear reactor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1836243.htm|work=ABC online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be completed by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505144252/http://www2.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|title=Australia's first reactor|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archivedate=5 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian Democracy sidebar |expanded=all}}
[[Jacques Maritain]], the French Catholic philosopher and author of over 60 books, advocated what he called "Integral Christian Humanism". He argued that [[secular]] forms of [[humanism]] were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person.

Once the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] dimension of [[human]] nature is rejected, Maritain has argued that we no longer have an integral, but merely partial, humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in Integral Humanism he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways [[Christianity]] could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. [[Maritain]]'s political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic]] movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

The term "'''interspecies family'''" refers to a group consisting of at least two members of different species who deeply care for each other. Examples include a human and their dog, a couple and their cats, a dog and a cat, or even a mule and a sheep. The emphasis is on love and that the members of the group care for and treat each other like a family.  For instance, "interspecies family" may describe a group composed of a dog and a person who refers to their dog as their child, best friend, or other phrase that connotes a stronger bond than just a "pet", a term which implies a sense of property and ownership.

Most often this is used to discuss non-human interspecies families, typically where a mother of one species will foster a youngling from a different species. With the more recent growth of the fields of [[anthrozoology]] and [[animal studies]], this is being used more frequently to refer especially to bonds between human and non-human animals. 
 
== History and use ==

=== Anthropomorphism ===
Some of the earliest instances of the interspecies family involve the use of [[anthropomorphism]], such as in the children's book ''[[Stuart Little]]'' in which a mouse is a member of a human family. This is a fairly common idea which led to some of the first uses of "interspecies family" in media targeted towards children.

=== Non-human animal relationships ===
There is also a popular trend in books and internet sites that involves capturing photographs and stories of interspecies non-human animal families.  These heartwarming cases promote the idea that animals can look past such differences. However, in these cases they are more often referred to as "interspecies adoptions", "interspecies pairings", and "interspecies friendships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nobel|first=Oliver|title=Interspecies Animal Friendships Will Warm Your Heart (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/30/interspecies-animal-friendships_n_1556674.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human and non-human animal relationships ===
Just recently, the term has been used to describe non-fiction situations involving human and non-human animal relationships. In 2011 a dissertation was written by Avigdor Edminster entitled ''"'This Dog Means Life': Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edminster|first=Avigdor|title="This Dog Means Life": Making Interspecies Relations at an Assistance Dog Agency|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107791/1/Edminster_umn_0130E_11975.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt;   in which "Interspecies families" is used frequently.  There have been other instances since then, but they have been strictly within academic works.

In the fall of 2013, The National Museum of Animals &amp; Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Animals and Society|url=http://www.museumofanimals.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created the exhibit entitled {{'}}''My Dog Is My Home: The Experience of Human-Animal Homelessness''{{'}}. The exhibit explores the experience of being homeless with an animal, and specifically the needs that are unmet because of homeless services' failure to recognize the legitimacy of the human-animal bond and their status as an "interspecies family". The exhibit helped popularize the phrase "interspecies family" among its animal protection audience as well as among social service providers. Part of the museum's mission is to promote this idea of inter-species families and make the general public more aware of the strong bonds that can be shared between human and non-human animals.

'''Klark Teknik''' is a company that designs and develops professional [[signal processing]] and [[audio equipment]]. Located in [[Kidderminster]], Worcestershire, UK, the company was founded in 1974 by brothers Terence and Phillip Clarke. It developed a number of new types of equipment in the audio field, winning a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise]] in 1986. It is now owned by [[Music Group (company)|Music Group]].

==History==
===Precursors===
In 1971, the brothers were running a company known as “Klark Equipment”, producing garage forecourt equipment: vending style [[vacuum cleaner]]s, [[space heater]]s and other similar products.

Phillip was the [[entrepreneur]] having previously run a clothing business in Australia.  Terry was the engineer: he had worked for [[Decca Records|Decca]] and was also an active local musician. With this background, the company soon branched into professional audio, at first upgrading and customising Decca multi-track tape recorders and later producing a very high quality ¼ inch 2-track tape machine of their own, the SM2. This tape machine was sold to the [[BBC]] and independent broadcasting companies under the brand name “Teknik”.

Terry also started to develop signal processing hardware including compressor/limiters and small [[graphic equaliser]]s. These were produced in very low quantities and sold to (mostly local) recording studios to complement the relatively simple [[audio mixing]] console of the day. The graphic equalisers developed during 1973 onwards were called Teknik 7S and 9S, with seven and nine bands respectively, plus a stereo 11+11S with eleven bands of EQ.

===Klark Teknik===
In 1974 the brand name “Klark Teknik” came into being. 1976 saw the first KT product produced in real volume, the DN27 (later DN27A and previously DN27S). Approximately 6500 units shipped between 1977 and 1985.

In 1980 the company moved to its current purpose built premises at Walter Nash Road, Kidderminster. Up until this point the business had been run out of an old [[Nissen hut]] in a back corner of the Summerfield MOD solid fuel rocket motor factory with only 15 employees.

Klark Teknik PLC was formed in 1985. In the following year Klark Teknik acquired the Hounslow based studio mixing company DDA and subsequently moved the manufacturing to Kidderminster.  The company further diversified by developing active studio monitors under the brand “Klark Acoustic”, winning a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award]] for export. It also launched the DN772, a seven second [[profanity delay]] with innovative time re-setting technology without pitch shifting artefacts, which featured in the BBC programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''.

===Subsequent mergers===
Klark Teknik purchased [[Midas Consoles|Midas Audio Systems Ltd]] in 1987.  In 1992, the Clarke brothers sold Klark Teknik Group to Mark IV Audio. Terry Clarke went on to set up MC2 Audio Ltd with co-founder Ian McCarthy in 1994, producing high quality power amplifiers for the commercial market.

Mark IV Audio sold both their holdings of [[Electro-Voice|EVI Audio]] (owners of Klark Teknik) and Telex Communications to venture capitalists Greenwich Street Partners in 1998, merging them into a single corporation called [[Telex Communications]]. On September 1, 2006, Greenwich sold Telex Communications to the [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch group]].

In December 2009, Midas and Klark Teknik were acquired by [[Music Group (company)|Music Group]], a holding company chaired by Uli Behringer, which also owns other audio companies such as [[Behringer]] and Bugera as well as Electronic Manufacturing Services company [[Eurotec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.music-group.com/brands.html |title=MUSIC Group - www.music-group.com |work=music-group.com |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://pro-music-news.com/html/01/e91208be.htm |title=Behringer's Music Group acquires Midas and Klark Teknik |work=pro-music-news.com |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurar''' (كورار, ''kūrār'')) is a type of [[Islamic embroidery|Arabic embroidery]] of weaving gold, silver and silk threads to create ribbons used to decorate clothing.

Each ribbon is made by a group of at least 3 women, the width of ribbon depending on the number of weavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.gov.bh/en/theevents/FestivalsandAnnualActivities/HeritageFestival/HeritageFestival2014/Craftsmen/Name,11190,en.html#.WtRtU_qsa01 |title=Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities - Kingdom of Bahrain {{!}} Craftsmen |last=MOC |website=culture.gov.bh |language=en |access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After preparing threads, a group of women (2 to 8), sitting in one row, weave threads through their fingers and crossing arms  with next women. One woman, sitting opposite, collects threads and tightens them with a special needle, creating the ribbon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atharna.com/journal/kurar-embroidery|title=Kurar Embroidery|website=www.atharna.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the whole length has been made, the ribbon is smoothed and polished with special "stones" and finally sewn to the rim of a dress. It takes about three days's work to make one length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary art is vanishing and kurar ribbons are being replaced by industrial-made decorations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''[[Laboratory]] rotations''' are typically a part of first year graduate school (Ph.D.-oriented) in American universities, especially in the research-oriented areas like [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] where an incoming student is expected to work in 4 to 6 different laboratories (each is called a "rotation") for durations of about 6 to 8 weeks, before making a final decision regarding which group he or she wishes to join.&lt;ref Name="Barker"&gt;{{cite book

Laboratory rotations are uncommon in the British university system, where a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidate is accepted into a laboratory soon after joining, and that is partly responsible for shorter duration needed for graduating.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Learning''' is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, [[knowledge]], [[behavior]]s, [[skill]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, or [[preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour] 6E, Hachette UK, {{ISBN|9781444164367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some [[machine learning|machines]]; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Learning and Memory. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 31-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner | origyear=2009| year=2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including [[educational psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[experimental psychology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]], or [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]] or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|title=What behavior can we expect of octopuses? - The Cephalopod Page|author=|date=|website=www.thecephalopodpage.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135515/http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|1380861|Learned helplessness}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for human behavioral learning [[prenatal]]ly, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and [[memory]] to occur very early on in [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sandman | first1 = Wadhwa | last2 = Hetrick | first2 = Porto | last3 = Peeke | year = 1997 | title = Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1040 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1997.tb01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. [[Lev Vygotsky]] agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.

=== Non-associative learning ===
''Non-associative learning'' refers to "a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus. Changes due to such factors as [[sensory adaptation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or injury do not qualify as non-associative learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191805/http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-associative learning can be divided into [[habituation]] and [[sensitization]].

==== Habituation ====
{{Main|Habituation}}
''Habituation'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=9781317762805|location=London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''&lt;ref name="gagliano2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63–72 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sensitization ====
{{Main|Sensitization}}
''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences - From Molecule to Behavior: a university textbook|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=9783642107689|location=Heidelberg|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful. The pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Active learning ===
{{main|Active learning}}

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|[[Experiential learning]] is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|title=Hierarchy of Skills|first=|last=Igor Kokcharov, Ph.D, PMP|date=22 May 2015|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217164955/http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Active learning'' occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[(Bransford, 2000, pg.15-20)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active learning is a key characteristic of [[student-centered learning]]. Conversely, [[passive learning]] and [[direct instruction]] are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or [[traditional education]]).

The [[research]] works on the human learning process as a [[complex adaptive system]] developed by [[Peter Belohlavek]] showed that it is the concept that the individual has that drives the accommodation process to assimilate new knowledge in the [[long-term memory]], defining learning as an intrinsically freedom-oriented and active process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[student-centered learning]] approach, the unicist reflection driven learning installs adaptive knowledge objects in the mind of the learner based on a cyclic process of: “action-reflection-action” to foster an [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3161708|title= Unicist Reflection Driven Learning for Superior Education|last= Belohlavek|first=Peter|date=2018-04-12|website= |publisher=SSRN|access-date= 2018-09-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associative learning ===
''Associative learning'' is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery Series: Introduction to Psychology|last=Plotnik|first=Rod|last2=Kouyomdijan|first2=Haig|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111347024|location=Belmont, CA|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
In ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.

==== Classical conditioning ====
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
The typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="bitterman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J. Comp. Psychol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 107–119 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.97.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Vyazovskiy|first2=Vladyslav V.|last3=Borbély|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Grimonprez|first4=Mavra|last5=Depczynski|first5=Martial|date=2016-12-02|title=Learning by Association in Plants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38427|doi=10.1038/srep38427|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5133544|pmid=27910933|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623143237/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is [[John B. Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "[[Little Albert]]", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====
{{Main|Observational learning}}
''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"&gt;Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of play:
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
# role play occurs starting at the age of 3
# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# construction play involves experimentation and building
# movement play aka physical play&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"/&gt;

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url = | journal = Educational &amp; Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===
{{Main|Enculturation}}
''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.&lt;ref name="Paradise1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being "acomedido".&lt;ref name=Lopez2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Angelica|last2=Najafi|first2=Behnosh|last3=Rogoff|first3=Barbara|last4=Mejia-Arauz|first4=Rebeca|title=Collaboration and helping as cultural practices|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic learning ===
''Episodic learning'' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, W. S. (2006). Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into [[episodic memory]], which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. &amp; Gage, N. M. (2007). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience. London: Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling: ICCM - 2004|last=Lovett|first=Marsha|last2=Schunn|first2=Christian|last3=Lebiere|first3=Christian|last4=Munro|first4=Paul|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0805854268|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; or - as some describe - a timeless organization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: Critical Concepts, Volume 1|last=Chrisley|first=Ronald|last2=Begeer|first2=Sander|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0415193320|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person remembers the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience: A Beginner's Guide|last=Gage|first=Nicole|last2=Baars|first2=Bernard|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128038130|location=London|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Multimedia learning ===
{{Main|Multimedia learning}}
''Multimedia learning'' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information {{Harv|Mayer|2001}}. This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===
{{Main|Electronic learning}}
''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[minimally invasive education]].

Moore (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* learner–instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and
* learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22-38). London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===
{{Main|Rote learning}}
''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.

=== Meaningful learning ===
{{See also|Deeper Learning}}
''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal learning ===
{{Main|Informal learning}}
''Informal learning'' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.

=== Formal learning ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html " Informal Learning in the Workplace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonformal learning ===
{{Main|Nonformal learning}}
''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "[[muscle memory]]" and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning,
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=marketing_papers | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J.

''[[Extra Credits]]'' writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for "tangential learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rath,|date=2015-01-22|title=Game Criticism as Tangential Learning Facilitator: The Case of Critical Intel|url=http://gamescriticism.org/articles/rath-2-1/|journal=Journal of Games Criticism|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozelius ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozelius et al|first=|date=|title=Motivating Factors and Tangential Learning for Knowledge Acquisition in Educational Games|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1154724.pdf|journal=The Electronic Journal of E-Learning|volume= 15| issue = 4 2017|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' games are presented as an example - by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Carlos|date=|year=2014|title=Kiwaka {{!}} Kiwaka Story (by LANDKA®)|url=http://www.lifeplay.es/volumen3/Analisis/067_070_RAMIREZ_MORENO_Analisis.pdf|journal=LifePlay|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case study about the mobile game {{Wikidata entity link| Q55416666}}.

=== Dialogic learning ===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
''Dialogic learning'' is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In ''incidental teaching'' learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say “train.” Once the student says “train,” he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|pages=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains ==
[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]
[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:
* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when "... cued, primed, and guided..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–25 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3. Learning and Transfer. How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition|year=2000|publisher=The National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426234827/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|archivedate=2013-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Transfer of Learning|journal=International Encyclopedia of Education|year=1992|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Agnes L.|title=The Bearing of the New Psychology upon the Teaching of Mathematics|journal=Teacher's College Record|year=1916|volume=17|pages=344–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz, Daniel L., John D. Bransford, and David Sears|title=Efficiency and innovation in transfer: Transfer of learning from a modern multidisciplinary perspective|year=2005|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the "level of attention", "attitudes", "method of attack" (or method for tackling a problem), a "search for new points of view", "a careful testing of hypothesis" and "generalization" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.&lt;ref name="Perkins" /&gt;

== Factors affecting learning ==

=== External factors ===
# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=ESSENTIALS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 5, 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn= 9788120330559|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J.C|title=Essentials Of Educational Psychology|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn= 9788125922926|page=596|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Physical environment'': The design, quality, and setting of a [[learning space]], such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a [[learning environment]]. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

=== Internal factors ===
There are several internal factors that affect learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=SK|title=ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120320383|page=536|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=H.R|title=Elements Of Educational Psychology|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn= 9788125000297|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are
# ''Goals or purposes'': Each and everyone has a goal. A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.
# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.
# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.
# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks "n" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.
# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589–598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V. A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235–246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the issue of supplying water to a very large population, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed hydraulic systems for multiple applications: public water supply, power using water mills, [[hydraulic mining]], fish tanks, irrigation, fire fighting, and of course [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] (Stein 2004). Scientists such as [[Ctesibius]] and [[Archimedes]] produced the first inventions involving hydraulic power (Oleson 1984). 

==Specific technology==
The most prevalent hydraulic pump used in maritime situations in [[ancient Rome]] was the [[bilge pump]], which functioned to siphon collected water out of a ship’s hull (Oleson 1984). The bilge pump was an improvement on the first hydraulic pumps used in antiquity: force pumps. Invented around the early 3rd century BCE, the most primitive design of a force pump consisted of a piston pushing water out of a tube, constructed by soldering individual bronze elements (Stein 246). 

Written accounts from Phil of Byzantium (late 3rd century BCE), Vitruvius (c. 25 BCE), and Hero of Alexandria (c. CE 50) confirm archaeological evidence for the original simple design, and both Hero and Vitruvius specify that the pump was typically made of bronze (Stein 2004). Somewhere along the way a new design arose that involved cutting apertures into an individual wood block and then rendering the block pressure-proof with tightly fitting plugs and plates (Stein 2004). 

Although cheaper and easier to manufacture, assemble, and repair, the wooden pumps manufactured from then on would most likely not have been durable enough for maritime use, which is why we usually find lead pipes associated with bilge pumps, bilge wells, and hydraulic devices of other function about ships. The amphora shipwreck discovered at Grado in Gorizia, Italy, which dates to around 200 CE, and contained what archaeologists hypothesized to be a ‘hydraulics’ system to change the water in live fish tanks, since other evidence indicates the ship’s involvement in the processed fish trade (Beltrame and Gaddi 2005).  

This hypothesis has been disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal axis of the hull found on the wreck suggest the existence of a bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish tank transport, entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well in the middle of the ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.

'''Medical resident work hours''' refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by [[medical intern]]s and residents during their [[medical residency]].

As per ACGME residents are allowed to work a max of 80hours a week. so typically residents will work 40-80  hours a week depends on speciality and rotation within the speciality ,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week.&lt;ref name=HRG&gt;[http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201116/http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.&lt;ref name="dishonesty" /&gt;

Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Defoe, Deidre M., et al. "Long Hours and Little Sleep: Work Schedules of Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology." ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'', vol. 97, no. 6, June 2001, pp. 1015–18. ''ScienceDirect'', doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01363-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 3604 first- and second-year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=DeWitt C.|last2=Daugherty|first2=Steven R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue in Residency Training: Results of a National Survey of First- and Second-Year Residents|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/27/2/217/2708402|journal=Sleep|volume=27|issue=2|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/sleep/27.2.217|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of high workloads ==
Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse.

Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US [[National Resident Matching Program#Controversy and lawsuits|have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to]], meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision.&lt;ref name="HRG"/&gt;  This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges|accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts]], thus reducing the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for residents, despite the work for much larger numbers of residents being available.

In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.

There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive.

The medical culture has also been blamed. "Generation-bashing", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork.&lt;ref name=schultz/&gt; A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt; A higher "entry barrier", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired.

There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods.

The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt;

==Effects on health==

===Effects of sleep deprivation on residents===
The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust.

Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;See Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991); {{cite journal | author = Bøggild Henrik, Knutsson Anders | year = 1999 | title = Shift Work, Risk Factors, and Cardiovascular Disease | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Health | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 85–99 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.410}}; and Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), "Shiftwork and Health," special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Yo-El S|last2=Ooms|first2=Sharon J|last3=Sutphen|first3=Courtney|last4=Macauley|first4=Shannon L.|last5=Zangrilli|first5=Margaret A.|last6=Jerome|first6=Gina|last7=Fagan|first7=Anne M.|last8=Mignot|first8=Emmanuel|last9=Zempel|first9=John M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2104/3933862|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=8|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1093/brain/awx148|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauppinen |first=Timo |year=2001 |title=The 24-Hour Society and Industrial Relations Strategies |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=European Industrial Relations Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |year=2003 |title=Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients===
The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s and affect [[Sleep deprivation#On attention and working memory|attention and working memory]]. Chronically sleep-deprived people also tend to strongly underestimate their degree of impairment.&lt;ref name="SleepDepPVT"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year= 2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469|last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, hand-eye coordination decreased to a level equal to the performance observed at a blood alcohol concentration of roughly 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Drew|last2=Reid|first2=Kathryn|date=July 1997|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/40775|journal=Nature|volume=388|issue=6639|pages=235–235|doi=10.1038/40775|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of 959 physicians, staying awake for a continuous 24 to 30 hours decreased physicians' overall performance by nearly 1 standard deviation and clinical performance by more than 1.5 standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philibert|first=Ingrid|date=2005-11-01|title=Sleep Loss and Performance in Residents and Nonphysicians: A Meta-Analytic Examination|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/28/11/1392/2707966|journal=Sleep|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1392–1402|doi=10.1093/sleep/28.11.1392|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. "Night float" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1| issn = 1949-8357| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 349–363| last1 = Bolster| first1 = Lauren| last2 = Rourke| first2 = Liam| title = The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review| journal = Journal of Graduate Medical Education| date = 2015| pmid = 26457139| pmc = 4597944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0014013031000085671| issn = 0014-0139| volume = 46| issue = 7| pages = 653–663| last1 = CAVALLO| first1 = ANITA| last2 = RIS| first2 = M.

Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Coggins R, Rosekind MR, Buccino KR. Relationship of day versus night sleep to physician performance and mood. Ann Emerg Med 1994;24:928-934.&lt;/ref&gt; First year medical residents given an EKG arrhythmia-detection task performed significantly worse while sleep-deprived than when well-rested.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman RC, Bigger JT, Kornfeld DS. The intern and sleep loss. N Eng J Med 1971;285:201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Medical residents were also found to take more time and make more errors on laparoscopic procedures after one night on call.&lt;ref&gt;Taffinder NJ, McManus IC, Gul Y, et al. Effect of sleep deprivation on surgeons' dexterity on laparoscopy simulator. Lancet 1998;352:1191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grantcharov TP, Bardram L, Funch-Jensen P, et al. Laparoscopic performance after one night on call in a surgical department: prospective study. BMJ 2001;323:1222-1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors [[blind experiment|blinded]] to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study.&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some new doctors are working 30-hour shifts at hospitals around the U.S. |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 28, 2015 |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib19Nov2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Northwestern-led study of medical residents working 28-hour shifts decried |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 19, 2015 |last=Russell |first=John |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-northwestern-long-hours-1119-biz-20151119-story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duty hour restrictions ==
===Effects of duty hour restrictions===
Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Residents Work Long Hours Despite Rules| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2016-05-06| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/12/04/166477987/medical-residents-work-long-hours-despite-rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|problems]]. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed.

Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs.

===Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US===
The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the [[ACGME]] allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff.

One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Najma|last2=Devitt|first2=Katharine S.|last3=Keshet|first3=Itay|last4=Spicer|first4=Jonathan|last5=Imrie|first5=Kevin|last6=Feldman|first6=Liane|last7=Cools-Lartigue|first7=Jonathan|last8=Kayssi|first8=Ahmed|last9=Lipsman|first9=Nir|date=2014-06-01|title=A systematic review of the effects of resident duty hour restrictions in surgery: impact on resident wellness, training, and patient outcomes|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=259|issue=6|pages=1041–1053|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000595|issn=1528-1140|pmc=4047317|pmid=24662409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolster|first=Lauren|last2=Rourke|first2=Liam|date=2015-09-01|title=The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=7|issue=3|pages=349–363|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1|issn=1949-8357|pmc=4597944|pmid=26457139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Wang|first6=Yanli|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=975–983|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.975|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 reform===
One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Canamucio|first6=Anne|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among patients in VA hospitals in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=984–992|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.984|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Kanaka D.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jayanta|date=2007-07-17|title=Changes in hospital mortality associated with residency work-hour regulations|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=2|pages=73–80|issn=1539-3704|pmid=17548403|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 reform===
When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Srijan|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry R.|last3=Didwania|first3=Aashish K.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Ann C.|last5=Amarnath|first5=Sudha|last6=Kolars|first6=Joseph C.|last7=Dalack|first7=Gregory W.|last8=Nichols|first8=Breck|last9=Guille|first9=Constance|date=2013-04-22|title=Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=8|pages=657–662; discussion 663|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.351|issn=2168-6114|pmc=4016974|pmid=23529201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Anindita|last3=Friedman|first3=William A.|date=2011-12-01|title=Results of a national neurosurgery resident survey on duty hour regulations|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1162–1170|doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182245989|issn=1524-4040|pmid=21606883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choby|first=Beth|last2=Passmore|first2=Cindy|date=2007-06-01|title=Faculty perceptions of the ACGME resident duty hour regulations in family medicine|journal=Family Medicine|volume=39|issue=6|pages=392–398|issn=0742-3225|pmid=17549647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Megha|last2=Drolet|first2=Brian C.|last3=Tammaro|first3=Dominick|last4=Fischer|first4=Staci A.|date=2014-10-01|title=Resident duty hours: a survey of internal medicine program directors|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1349–1354|doi=10.1007/s11606-014-2912-z|issn=1525-1497|pmc=4175662|pmid=24913004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|Problems with duty hour restrictions]].

=== Problems with duty hour restrictions ===
It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours&lt;ref name=dishonesty&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Charles L.|date=2013-12-01|title=Are Duty Hour Regulations Promoting a Culture of Dishonesty Among Resident Physicians?|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=5|issue=4|pages=553–555|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-13-00220.1|issn=1949-8349|pmc=3886449|pmid=24454999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even punished if they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.169| issn = 2168-6262| volume = 148| issue = 5| pages = 427–433| last1 = Drolet| first1 = Brian C.| last2 = Sangisetty| first2 = Suma| last3 = Tracy| first3 = Thomas F.| last4 = Cioffi| first4 = William G.| title = Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations| journal = JAMA Surgery| date =2013| pmid = 23677406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, these studies – particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jena|first=Anupam B.|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2013-09-01|title=Duty hour reform in a shifting medical landscape|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1238–1240|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2439-8|issn=1525-1497|pmc=3744286|pmid=23568191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty Hours, Quality of Care, and Patient Safety: General Surgery Resident Perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1072-7515|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Stuart H.|last2=Miller|first2=Robert H.|last3=Weng|first3=Cindy|last4=Gurgel|first4=Richard K.|date=2014-10-01|title=The effect of duty hour regulation on resident surgical case volume in otolaryngology|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume=151|issue=4|pages=599–605|doi=10.1177/0194599814546111|issn=1097-6817|pmid=25135524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hundert|first=Samuel A.|last2=White|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Reilly|first3=Dominic F.|date=2015-08-01|title=Number of General Medicine Hospital Admissions Performed by Internal Medicine Residents Before and After the 2011 Duty-Hour Regulations|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=108|issue=8|pages=476–481|doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000323|issn=1541-8243|pmid=26280773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision-making and medical errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed methods of reducing workloads ==
The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilkey/&gt;

Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 ''[[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/AnnualReports/PY2012/Healthcare%20Labor%20Shortages%20and%20Potential%20Solutions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment.

===Regulations===

====EU regulation====
Junior doctors in the [[European Union]] fall under the [[European Working Time Directive]], which specifies:

* 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
* 11 hours continuous rest per day 
* one day off each week, or two days off each [[fortnight]] 
* 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours

However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours.  Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bma.org.uk/support-at-work/ewtd/ewtd-juniors&lt;/ref&gt;

====American regulation====
The issue is politically controversial in the [[United States]], where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's [[medical residency]]. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/dh-ComparisonTable2003v2011.pdf Regulation changes]&lt;/ref&gt; regulations from the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours for first, second, and third year residents.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2003rulesJAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert I, Friedmann P, Williams WT |title=New requirements for resident duty hours |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=9 |pages=1112–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12204081 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.9.1112|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011rulesNEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas J.

What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts.  While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report [https://archive.is/20121211093643/http://www.iom.edu/residenthours ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''.] While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1).  The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours.  The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance.   The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, David A., et al. "Resident Duty Hours and Medical Education Policy — Raising the Evidence Bar." ''New England Journal of Medicine'', vol. 376, no. 18, May 2017, pp. 1704–06. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM'', doi:10.1056/NEJMp1703690.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bilimoria KY, Chung JW, Hedges LV, et al. National cluster-randomized trial of duty-hour flexibility in surgical training. N Engl J Med 2016;374:713-727&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at primary outcomes of 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Starting July 1, 2017, the ACGME raised the maximum number of consecutive hours a first year resident can work from 16 hours to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/blog/acgme-duty-hours-not-the-only-big-change-in-requirements/|title=ACGME Duty Hours Have Changed. What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the survey of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These residents cited "additional experience" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by "opportunity to see rare cases" (46.5%) and "continuity with patients" (31.8%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====Towards an 80-hour work week=====
The [[Libby Zion Law|Libby Zion case]], in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Nachiket|date=2014-12-30|title=Learning lessons: the Libby Zion case revisited|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=64|issue=25|pages=2802–2804|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.007|issn=1558-3597|pmid=25541134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=2006-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there."&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medial Residents' Working Hours |url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/healthcare/articles.cfm?ID=6666 |publisher=Public Citizen, Health Research Group |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="ACGMEDutyHours"/&gt;

The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require:
# An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
# A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
# A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
# No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
# One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
# In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.&lt;ref&gt;"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs."  2006.  Page 45 of 154.  [http://www.osteopathic.org/pdf/sir_postdoctrainproced.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call.
#The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours.
#The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period.
#Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.
#All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity.
#Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts.
#The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved.
#The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period.

Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection.&lt;ref name=Wilkey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert Neil|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum-Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CF8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3D2b8NT76sEuLZ0QGn8cTZBQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy.  Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce.  Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.).  Additionally, a one-size-fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties.

==Coping mechanisms== 
Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R.|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T.|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty hours, quality of care, and patient safety: general surgery resident perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77; discussion 77–79|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1879-1190|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions.

Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

A '''modular vehicle''' is one in which substantial components of the vehicle are interchangeable. This modularity is intended to make repairs and maintenance easier, or to allow the vehicle to be reconfigured to suit different functions.

Another application of modular vehicle design is to enable the exchange of batteries in an electric vehicle.

In a modular electric vehicle, the power system, wheels and suspension can be contained in a single module or chassis. When the batteries need recharging, the vehicle's body is lifted off and placed onto a fresh power module. By using this ''Modular Vehicle'' system, the vehicle's batteries do not have to be removed or reinstalled, and their connections remain intact.

==History of the modern modular vehicle==
[[File:Ridek3 modular electric vehicle.jpg|thumb|The Ridek III body and chassis can be separated to change body styles or to put the same body on a chassis with fully charged batteries.]]
The world's first road-licensed quick-change modular electric vehicle, based on a patent awarded to Dr Gordon E Dower in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Dower, Gordon E, 2000, US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-6059058.html "Modular vehicle construction and transportation system"]&lt;/ref&gt; was shown at the [[World Electric Vehicle Association]] 2003 Electric Vehicle Symposium EVS-20 in Long Beach, California, USA. 

Dower described the vehicle's two parts as its motorized deck, shortened to ''Modek'', and its "containing module" or ''Ridon''. When attached to each other, the vehicle thus formed was dubbed the ''Ridek''. Mechanical connections between the modules for braking and steering automatically engage when the body is lowered on to the chassis.
 
In 2004, General Motors attempted to patent a modular vehicle called ''Autonomy''&lt;ref&gt;Patent application 10/966,548, filed 10/15/2004, assigned General Motors, lead inventor Adrian B Chernoff&lt;/ref&gt; but the attempt was unsuccessful because Dower’s patent already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Patent 10/966/548,denied 2/23/2006, Attorney docket no: GP -3015791/GM0268PUS-1&lt;/ref&gt; 

A team at GM did, however, continue to work on Autonomy, which was intended to be powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. They unveiled a non-drivable version of their modular vehicle in January 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;King, Ralph, [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/10/01/349458/index.htm "GM's Race to the Future - the inside story of how the world's biggest automaker came to see the hydrogen car as its salvation - and took the lead in the engineering challenge of the century"], ''Business 2.0'' Magazine, Oct 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; GM unveiled a drivable prototype, called [[General Motors Hy-wire|Hy-wire]] at the Paris Auto Show in September, 2002.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; The name referred to the Hydrogen fuel and the "drive-by-wire" system that electronically connected the vehicle modules for steering, braking and controlling the 4 wheel motors. Hy-wire did not go into production.

==Flexibility==

Modular vehicles make it possible to use different types of bodies, e.g. sedan, sports car or pickup truck, on one standardized chassis.&lt;ref&gt;Chernoff, Adrian B et al, 2003 US Patent: [http://patents.com/us-20030094319.html "Vehicle body interchangeability"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the modular chassis, with its batteries and motor, are relatively easy to work on, since there is no vehicle body to impede access.

'''Mos Teutonicus''' (Latin: ''the Germanic custom'') was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.

== Background ==

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.&lt;ref name= Keen&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 0300033605}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate.

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.&lt;ref name=Schafer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scäfer |first1=Von Dietrich |last2= |first2= |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |issue=|pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''mos Teutonicus'', meaning ‘the Germanic custom.’{{#tag:ref|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; |group=note}}

English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of ''mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |last2= |first2= |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |issue=|pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;  Embalming and ''mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to [[France]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt;

== Process ==

The process of ''mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water or wine&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; for several hours.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt; Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with [[salt]] in the same manner as animal meat.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.&lt;ref name=Schafer /&gt;

== Prohibition of the practice ==

Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.&lt;ref name=Westerhof /&gt; In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. This probably hindered the research of some anatomists as they feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies but ''[[De Sepulturis]]'' only prohibited the act of ''mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general.

'''Mycorestoration''' is the use of [[fungi]] to restore degraded environments. It is a multi-method approach to restore damaged habitats such as [[oil spill]] sites and [[logging roads]], while also restoring the health of targeted forest sites that have been compromised in development. Mycorestoration is also used to control insect populations. It generally uses a four-tier approach of [[mycofiltration]], [[mycoforestry]], [[mycoremediation]], and [[mycopesticides]]. The mycelia of a number of different gilled fungi are used in some of these applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wildlandscpr.org/biblio-notes/evaluating-use-mycorestoration-decommissioned-roads-arizona | title=Evaluating the Use of Mycorestoration on Decommissioned Roads in Arizona | publisher=Wildlands CPR | date=December 11, 2005 | accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mysticism''' is the practice of [[religious ecstasy|religious ecstasies]] (religious experiences during [[Altered state of consciousness|alternate states of consciousness]]), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word μυω, meaning "to conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} mysticism referred to the biblical liturgical, spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval [[Christianity]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} During the [[early modern period]], the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to "extraordinary experiences and states of mind".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}}

In modern times, "mysticism" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the "union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God".&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; valuing "mystical experience" as a key element of mysticism.

Broadly defined, mysticism can be found in all [[Religion#Types and demographics|religious traditions]], from [[indigenous religions]] and [[folk religions]] like shamanism, to organised religions like the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] faiths and [[Indian religions]], and modern spirituality, New Age and New Religious Movements.

Since the 1960s scholars have debated the merits of [[perennial philosophy|perennial]] and [[social constructionism|constructionist]] approaches in the scientific research of "mystical experiences".{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The perennial position is now "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} most scholars using a contextual approach, which takes the cultural and historical context into consideration.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Christian contemplation|Henosis}}

"Mysticism" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μυω}}, meaning "I conceal",{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and its derivative {{lang|grc|μυστικός}}, ''[[Wikt:μυστικός|mystikos]]'', meaning 'an initiate'. The verb {{lang|el|μυώ}} has received a quite different meaning in the Greek language, where it is still in use. The primary meanings it has are "induct" and "initiate". Secondary meanings include "introduce", "make someone aware of something", "train", "familiarize", "give first experience of something".&lt;ref group=web name="WordReference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordreference.com/gren/μυώ |title=μυώ |author=|date= |website=WordReference English-Greek Dictionary |publisher=WordReference.com |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related form of the verb {{lang|el|μυέω}} (mueó or myéō) appears in the [[New Testament]]. As explained in ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', it properly means shutting the eyes and mouth to experience mystery. Its figurative meaning is to be initiated into the "mystery revelation". The meaning derives from the initiatory rites of the pagan mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3453.htm |title=3453. mueó |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also appearing in the New Testament is the related noun {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} (mustérion or mystḗrion), the root word of the English term "mystery".  The term means "anything hidden", a mystery or secret, of which initiation is necessary. In the New Testament it reportedly takes the meaning of the counsels of God, once hidden but now revealed in the Gospel or some fact thereof, the Christian revelation generally, and/or particular truths or details of the Christian revelation.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thayer's Greek Lexicon, the  term {{lang|el|μυστήριον}} in classical Greek meant "a hidden thing", "secret". A particular meaning it took in [[Classical antiquity]] was a religious secret or religious secrets, confided only to the initiated and not to be communicated by them to ordinary mortals. In the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament the meaning it took was that of a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will. It is sometimes used for the hidden wills of humans, but is more often used for the hidden will of God. Elsewhere in the Bible it takes the meaning of  the mystic or hidden sense of things. It is used for the secrets behind sayings, names, or behind images seen in visions and dreams. The [[Vulgate]] often translates the Greek term to the Latin {{lang|la|sacramentum}} ([[sacrament]]).&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related noun {{lang|el|μύστης}}  (mustis or mystis, singular) means the initiate, the person initiated to the mysteries.&lt;ref group=web name="Strong's Concordance2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3466.htm |title=3466. mustérion |author=|date= |website=Strong's Concordance |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=April 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ana Jiménez San Cristobal in her study of [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] and [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], the singular form {{lang|el|μύστης}} and the plural form {{lang|el|μύσται}} are used in ancient Greek texts to mean the person or persons initiated to religious mysteries. These followers of mystery religions belonged to a select group, where access was only gained through an initiation. She finds that the terms were associated with the term {{lang|el|βάκχος}} ([[Dionysus|Bacchus]]), which was used for a special class of initiates of the Orphic mysteries. The terms are first found connected in the writings of [[Heraclitus]]. Such initiates are identified in texts with the persons who have been purified and have performed certain rites. A passage of the ''[[Cretans (Euripides)|Cretans]]'' by [[Euripides]] seems to explain that the {{lang|el|μύστης}} (initiate) who devotes himself to an ascetic life, renounces sexual activities, and avoids contact with the dead becomes known as {{lang|el|βάκχος}}. Such initiates were believers in the god Dionysus Bacchus who took on the name of their god and sought an identification with their deity.&lt;ref name="San Cristobal"&gt;San Cristobal (2009), p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term ''[[contemplatio]]'', c.q. ''[[theoria]]''.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} According to Johnson, "[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities."{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}}

==Definitions==
According to Peter Moore, the term "mysticism" is "problematic but indispensable."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} It is a generic term which joins together into one concept separate practices and ideas which developed separately,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} According to Dupré, "mysticism" has been defined in many ways,{{sfn|Dupré|2005}} and Merkur notes that the definition, or meaning, of the term "mysticism" has changed through the ages.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Moore further notes that the term "mysticism" has become a popular label for "anything nebulous, esoteric, occult, or supernatural."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

Parsons warns that "what might at times seem to be a straightforward phenomenon exhibiting an unambiguous commonality has become, at least within the academic study of religion, opaque and controversial on multiple levels".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Because of its Christian overtones, and the lack of similar terms in other cultures, some scholars regard the term "mysticism" to be inadequate as a useful descriptive term.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}} Other scholars regard the term to be an inauthentic fabrication,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; the "product of post-Enlightenment universalism."{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6355}}

Deriving from [[Neo-Platonism]] and [[Henosis]], mysticism is popularly known as union with God or the Absolute.{{sfn|McGinn|2005}}{{sfn|Moore|2005}} In the 13th century the term ''unio mystica'' came to be used to refer to the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; In the 19th century, under the influence of Romanticism, this "union" was interpreted as a "religious experience," which provides certainty about God or a transcendental reality.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Note that Parmenides' "way of truth" may also be translated as "way of conviction." [[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. Cook's translation "way of conviction" is rendered by other translators as "way of truth."}}

An influential proponent of this understanding was [[William James]] (1842–1910), who stated that "in mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}} William James popularized this use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'',{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences.{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Religious experiences belonged to the "personal religion,"{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} which he considered to be "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism".{{sfn|James|1982|p=30}} He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions.{{refn|group=note|William James: "This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which bring it about that the mystical classics have, as been said, neither birthday nor native land."{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=14}}}}

McGinn notes that the term ''unio mystica'', although it has Christian origins, is primarily a modern expression.{{sfn|McGinn|2005|p=6334}} McGinn argues that "presence" is more accurate than "union", since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union. He also argues that we should speak of "consciousness" of God's presence, rather than of "experience", since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about "new ways of knowing and loving based on states of awareness in which God becomes present in our inner acts."{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}

However, the idea of "union" does not work in all contexts. For example, in Advaita Vedanta, there is only one reality (Brahman) and therefore nothing other than reality to unite with it—Brahman in each person (''atman'') has always in fact been identical to Brahman all along. Dan Merkur also notes that union with God or the Absolute is a too limited definition, since there are also traditions which aim not at a sense of unity, but of [[Kenosis|nothingness]], such as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Meister Eckhart]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to Merkur, [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and Buddhism also emphasize [[Sunyata|nothingness]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Blakemore and Jennett note that "definitions of mysticism [...] are often imprecise." They further note that this kind of interpretation and definition is a recent development which has become the standard definition and understanding.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Blakemore and Jennett: "Mysticism is frequently defined as an experience of direct communion with God, or union with the Absolute, but definitions of mysticism (a relatively modern term) are often imprecise and usually rely on the presuppositions of the modern study of mysticism — namely, that mystical experiences involve a set of intense and usually individual and private psychological states [...] Furthermore, mysticism is a phenomenon said to be found in all major religious traditions.&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/mysticism.aspx#3 Colin Blakemore and Shelia Jennett (2001), ''The Oxford Companion to the Body'']&lt;/ref&gt; Blakemore and Jennett add: "[T]he common assumption that all mystical experiences, whatever their context, are the same cannot, of course, be demonstrated." They also state: "Some have placed a particular emphasis on certain altered states, such as visions, trances, levitations, locutions, raptures, and ecstasies, many of which are altered bodily states. Margery Kempe's tears and [[Teresa of Avila]]'s ecstasies are famous examples of such mystical phenomena. But many mystics have insisted that while these experiences may be a part of the mystical state, they are not the essence of mystical experience, and some, such as Origen, Meister Eckhart, and John of the Cross, have been hostile to such psycho-physical phenomena. Rather, the essence of the mystical experience is the encounter between God and the human being, the Creator and creature; this is a union which leads the human being to an ‘absorption’ or loss of individual personality. It is a movement of the heart, as the individual seeks to surrender itself to ultimate Reality; it is thus about being rather than knowing. For some mystics, such as Teresa of Avila, phenomena such as visions, locutions, raptures, and so forth are by-products of, or accessories to, the full mystical experience, which the soul may not yet be strong enough to receive. Hence these altered states are seen to occur in those at an early stage in their spiritual lives, although ultimately only those who are called to achieve full union with God will do so."&lt;ref group=web name="Oxord-body" /&gt;}}

According to Gelman, "A unitive experience involves a phenomenological de-emphasis, blurring, or eradication of multiplicity, where the cognitive significance of the experience is deemed to lie precisely in that phenomenological feature".{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gelman: "Examples are experiences of the oneness of all of nature, “union” with God, as in Christian mysticism, (see section 2.2.1), the Hindu experience that [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]] (that the self/soul is identical with the eternal, absolute being), the Buddhist unconstructed experience, and “monistic” experiences, devoid of all multiplicity."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare [[Plotinus]], who argued that ''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul," initiating an ascent of the soul by [[Abstraction#In philosophy|abstraction]] or "taking away," culminating in a [[Subitism|sudden appearance]] of ''the One''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=8}}}}

===Religious ecstasies and interpretative context===
{{Main article|Religious ecstasy|Altered state of consciousness|Cognitive science of religion|Neurotheology|Attribution (psychology)}}

Mysticism involves an explanatory context, which provides meaning for so-called mystical and visionary experiences, and related experiences like trances. According to Dan Merkur, mysticism may relate to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness, and the ideas and explanations related to them.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Merkur: "Mysticism is the practice of religious ecstasies (religious experiences during alternate states of consciousness), together with whatever ideologies, ethics, rites, myths, legends, and magic may be related to them."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}} Parsons stresses the importance of distinguishing between temporary experiences and mysticism as a process, which is embodied within a "religious matrix" of texts and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}{{refn|group=note|Parsons: "...episodic experience and mysticism as a ''process'' that, though surely punctuated by moments of visionary, unitive, and transformative encounters, is ultimately inseparable from its embodied relation to a total religious matrix: liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals, practice and the arts.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=4–5}}}} Richard Jones does the same.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 1}} Peter Moore notes that mystical experience may also happen in a spontaneous and natural way, to people who are not committed to any religious tradition. These experiences are not necessarily interpreted in a religious framework.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356}} [[Ann Taves]] asks by which processes experiences are set apart and deemed religious or mystical.{{sfn|Taves|2009}}

===Intuitive insight and enlightenment===
{{Main article|Enlightenment (spiritual)|Divine illumination|Subitism}}

Some authors emphasize that mystical experience involves intuitive understanding of the meaning of existence and of hidden truths, and the resolution of life problems. According to Larson, "mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}{{refn|group=note|Larson: "A mystical experience is an intuitive understanding and realization of the meaning of existence – an intuitive understanding and realization which is intense, integrating, self-authenticating, liberating – i.e., providing a sense of release from ordinary self-awareness – and subsequently determinative – i.e., a primary criterion – for interpreting all other experience whether cognitive, conative, or affective."{{sfn|Lidke|2005|p=144}}}} According to McClenon, mysticism is "the doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|McClenon: "The doctrine that special mental states or events allow an understanding of ultimate truths. Although it is difficult to differentiate which forms of experience allow such understandings, mental episodes supporting belief in "other kinds of reality" are often labeled mystical [...] Mysticism tends to refer to experiences supporting belief in a cosmic unity rather than the advocation of a particular religious ideology."&lt;ref group=web name="Hartford"&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Mysticism.htm James McClenon, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopedia of Religion and Society]&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to James R. Horne, mystical illumination "a central visionary experience [...] that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Horne: "[M]ystical illumination is interpreted as a central visionary experience in a psychological and behavioural process that results in the resolution of a personal or religious problem. This factual, minimal interpretation depicts mysticism as an extreme and intense form of the insight seeking process that goes in activities such as solving theoretical problems or developing new inventions.{{sfn|Horne|1996|p=9}}}}

According to Evelyn Underhill, ''illumination''  is a generic English term for the phenomenon of mysticism. The term ''illumination'' is derived from the Latin ''[[Wikt:illuminatio|illuminatio]]'', applied to Christian [[prayer]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Underhill|2008}} Comparable Asian terms are [[bodhi]], [[kensho]] and [[satori]] in [[Buddhism]], commonly translated as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], and [[vipassana]], which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world, and there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pp=181–183}}

===Spiritual life and re-formation===
{{Main article|Spirituality|Spiritual development|Self-realization|Ego death}}

Other authors point out that mysticism involves more than "mystical experience." According to Gellmann, the ultimate goal of mysticism is human transformation, not just experiencing mystical or visionary states.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|Gellman: "Typically, mystics, theistic or not, see their mystical experience as part of a larger undertaking aimed at human transformation (See, for example, Teresa of Avila, Life, Chapter 19) and not as the terminus of their efforts. Thus, in general, ‘mysticism’ would best be thought of as a constellation of distinctive practices, discourses, texts, institutions, traditions, and experiences aimed at human transformation, variously defined in different traditions."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} According to [[Evelyn Underhill]], mysticism is "the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}{{refn|group=note|Original quote in "Evelyn Underhill (1930), ''Mysticism: A Study in the Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness''.{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}{{refn|group=note|Underhill: "One of the most abused words in the English language, it has been used in different and often mutually exclusive senses by religion, poetry, and philosophy: has been claimed as an excuse for every kind of [[occultism]], for dilute [[transcendentalism]], vapid [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], religious or aesthetic sentimentality, and bad [[metaphysics]]. on the other hand, it has been freely employed as a term of contempt by those who have criticized these things. It is much to be hoped that it may be restored sooner or later to its old meaning, as the science or art of the spiritual life."{{sfn|Underhill|2012|p=xiv}}}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation which "aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the [[Torah]], in Christianity [[Christ]], in Buddhism [[Buddha]], in the [[Islam]] [[Muhammad]]."{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} Waaijman uses the word "omvorming",{{sfn|Waaijman|2000|p=460}} "to change the form". Different translations are possible: transformation, re-formation, [[Alchemy|trans-mutation]]. Waaijman points out that "spirituality" is only one term of a range of words which denote the praxis of spirituality.{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}} Some other terms are "Hasidism, contemplation, kabbala, asceticism, mysticism, perfection, devotion and piety".{{sfn|Waaijman|2002|p=315}}}} According to McGinn, personal transformation is the essential criterion to determine the authenticity of Christian mysticism.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}{{refn|group=note|McGinn: "This is why the only test that Christianity has known for determining the authenticity of a mystic and her or his message has been that of personal transformation, both on the mystic's part and—especially—on the part of those whom the mystic has affected.{{sfn|McGinn|2006}}}}

==History of the term==
===Hellenistic world===
In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to "secret" religious rituals{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} A "mystikos" was an initiate of a mystery religion.

===Early Christianity===
{{Main article|Greco-Roman mysteries|Early Christianity|Esoteric Christianity}}

In early Christianity the term "mystikos" referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The biblical dimension refers to "hidden" or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ at the Eucharist.{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}}

Until the sixth century, the Greek term ''theoria,'' meaning "contemplation" in Latin, was used for the mystical interpretation of the Bible.{{sfn|Johnson|1997|p=24}} The link between mysticism and the vision of the Divine was introduced by the early [[Church Fathers]], who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology".

''Theoria'' enabled the Fathers to perceive depths of meaning in the biblical writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inspired%20vision&amp;f=false John Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition: The Bible and Its Interpretation in the Orthodox Church''], St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Antiochene Fathers, in particular, saw in every passage of Scripture a double meaning, both literal and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6r7lQ6np94YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=breck+bible+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s4rJTJCkDs2eOpDmpLcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=double%20meaning&amp;f=false Breck, ''Scripture in Tradition''], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, ''theoria'' or contemplation came to be distinguished from intellectual life, leading to the identification of θεωρία or ''contemplatio'' with a [[contemplative prayer|form of prayer]]&lt;ref name=ODCC/&gt; distinguished from discursive meditation in both East&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CpPnSHWu5d8C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Matt%C3%A1+al-Misk%C4%ABn+%22return+of+adam%22&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Mattá al-Miskīn, ''Orthodox Prayer Life: The Interior Way'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2003] {{ISBN|0-88141-250-3}}), pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; and West.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |title=Augustin Poulain, "Contemplation", in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' 1908 |access-date=2011-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113160224/http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Contemplation |archive-date=2012-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval meaning===
{{See also|Middle Ages}}

This threefold meaning of "mystical" continued in the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} According to Dan Merkur, the term ''unio mystica'' came into use in the 13th century as a synonym for the "spiritual marriage," the ecstasy, or rapture, that was experienced when prayer was used "to contemplate both God’s omnipresence in the world and God in his essence."&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; Under the influence of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] the [[mystical theology]] came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible,{{sfn|King|2002|p=15}} and "the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names."{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6341}} Pseudo-Dionysius' [[Apophatic theology]], or "negative theology", exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity, although it was mostly a male religiosity, since women were not allowed to study.{{sfn|King|2002|p=195}} It was influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]], and very influential in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing [[Cataphatic theology]] or "positive theology". It is best known nowadays in the western world from [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[John of the Cross]].

===Early modern meaning===
{{See also|Early modern period}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 166.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25| ''The Appearance of the Holy Spirit before Saint Teresa of Ávila,'' [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]
In the sixteenth and seventeenth century ''mysticism'' came to be used as a substantive.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} This shift was linked to a new discourse,{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} in which science and religion were separated.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–18}}

[[Martin Luther|Luther]] dismissed the allegorical interpretation of the bible, and condemned Mystical theology, which he saw as more Platonic than Christian.{{sfn|King|2002|p=16}} "The mystical", as the search for the hidden meaning of texts, became secularised, and also associated with literature, as opposed to science and prose.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=16–17}}

Science was also distinguished from religion. By the middle of the 17th century, "the mystical" is increasingly applied exclusively to the religious realm, separating religion and "natural philosophy" as two distinct approaches to the discovery of the hidden meaning of the universe.{{sfn|King|2002|p=17}} The traditional hagiographies and writings of the saints became designated as "mystical", shifting from the virtues and miracles to extraordinary experiences and states of mind, thereby creating a newly coined "mystical tradition".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=17–18}} A new understanding developed of the Divine as residing within human, an essence beyond the varieties of religious expressions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}}

===Contemporary meaning===
{{See also|Western esotericism|Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Syncretism|Spirituality|New Age}}

The 19th century saw a growing emphasis on individual experience, as a defense against the growing rationalism of western society.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; The meaning of mysticism was considerably narrowed:&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/400861/mysticism Dan Merkur, ''Mysticism'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The competition between the perspectives of theology and science resulted in a compromise in which most varieties of what had traditionally been called mysticism were dismissed as merely psychological phenomena and only one variety, which aimed at union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God—and thereby the perception of its essential unity or oneness—was claimed to be genuinely mystical. The historical evidence, however, does not support such a narrow conception of mysticism.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;}}

Under the influence of [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]], which was popularised in both the west and the east by [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalists]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], mysticism has been applied to a broad spectrum of religious traditions, in which all sorts of [[esotericism]] and religious traditions and practices are joined together.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}}{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}} The term mysticism was extended to comparable phenomena in non-Christian religions,&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; where it influenced Hindu and Buddhist responses to colonialism, resulting in [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|King|2002}}{{sfn|McMahan|2010}}

In the contemporary usage "mysticism" has become an umbrella term for all sorts of non-rational world views.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3-5}} William Harmless even states that mysticism has become "a catch-all for religious weirdness".{{sfn|Harmless|2007|p=3}} Within the academic study of religion the apparent "unambiguous commonality" has become "opaque and controversial".{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} The term "mysticism" is being used in different ways in different traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=3}} Some call to attention the conflation of mysticism and linked terms, such as spirituality and esotericism, and point at the [[Différance|differences]] between various traditions.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|pp=3–4}}

==Variations of mysticism==
Based on various definitions of mysticism, namely mysticism as an experience of union or nothingness, mysticism as any kind of an altered state of consciousness which is attributed in a religious way, mysticism as "enlightenment" or insight, and mysticism as a way of transformation, "mysticism" can be found in many cultures and religious traditions, both in [[folk religion]] and [[organized religion]]. These traditions include practices to induce religious or mystical experiences, but also ethical standards and practices to enhance self-control and integrate the mystical experience into daily life.

Dan Merkur notes, though, that mystical practices are often separated from daily religious practices, and restricted to "religious specialists like monastics, priests, and other renunciates.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt;

===Shamanism===
[[File:Khagdaev1.JPG|frameless|left|upright=0.9|Shaman]]
{{Main article|Shamanism}}

According to Dan Merkur, shamanism may be regarded as a form of mysticism, in which the world of spirits is accessed through [[religious ecstasy]].&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Mysticism" /&gt; According to [[Mircea Eliade]] shamanism is a "technique of [[religious ecstasy]]."&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamanism  is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop87|Hoppál 1987]].  p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance|trance state]] during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "shamanism" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]], as well as those of the neighboring [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking peoples. The term is also used to describe similar magico-religious practices found within the [[ethnic religion]]s of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas. For instance, [[Louisiana Voodoo]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[West African Vodun]], [[Dominican Vudú]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] are related{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} folk-religions with ecstatic elements.

[[Neoshamanism]] refers to  "new"' forms of  [[shamanism]], or methods of seeking visions or  healing, typically practiced in Western countries. Neoshamanism comprises an eclectic range of beliefs and practices that involve attempts to attain altered states and communicate with a spirit world, and is associated with [[New Age]] practices.&lt;ref name="Harner1"&gt;Harner, Michael ''The Way of the Shaman.'' 1980, new edition, HarperSanFrancisco, 1990, {{ISBN|0-06-250373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equip.org/article/the-new-age-embraces-shamanism/ The New Age embaraces Shamanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Orthodox Church]] has a long tradition of ''[[theoria]]'' (intimate experience) and ''[[hesychasm|hesychia]]'' (inner stillness), in which [[contemplative prayer]] silences the mind to progress along the path of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' (deification).

''Theosis'', practical unity with and conformity to God, is obtained by engaging in [[contemplative prayer]], the first stage of ''theoria'',&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=MHV|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "Noetic prayer is the first stage of theoria."&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"/&gt;}} which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (''[[nepsis]]''). In ''theoria'', one comes to behold the "divisibly indivisible" divine operations (''[[Essence–energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|energeia]]'') of God as the "uncreated light" of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], a grace which is eternal and proceeds naturally from the blinding darkness of the incomprehensible divine essence.{{refn|group=note|[[Theophan the Recluse]]: "The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theophan the Recluse]], ''What Is prayer?''. Cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'', p.73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos: "This is what Saint Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems, proclaims over and over that, while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in "theoria" (vision of God), the saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine "therapeutic tradition.""&lt;ref name="Vlachos_difference"&gt;Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos, [http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/hierotheos_difference.aspx ''The Difference Between Orthodox Spirituality and Other Traditions'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is the main aim of [[hesychasm]], which was developed in the thought St. [[Symeon the New Theologian]], embraced by the monastic communities on [[Mount Athos]], and most notably defended by St. [[Gregory Palamas]] against the Greek [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] philosopher [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]]. According to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] critics, hesychastic practice has its roots to the introduction of a systematic practical approach to [[quietism (Christian philosophy)|quietism]] by [[Symeon the New Theologian]].{{refn|group=note|Catholic Encyclopedia: "But it was Simeon, "the new theologian" (c. 1025-c. 1092; see Krumbacher, op. cit., 152–154), a monk of Studion, the "greatest mystic of the Greek Church" (loc. cit.), who evolved the [[quietist]] theory so elaborately that he may be called the father of Hesychasm. For the union with God in contemplation (which is the highest object of our life) he required a regular system of spiritual education beginning with baptism and passing through regulated exercises of penance and asceticism under the guidance of a director. But he had not conceived the grossly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] practices of the later Hesychasts; his ideal is still enormously more philosophical than theirs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07301a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia online article Hesychasm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience,&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"&gt;[[#refdeCatanzaro1980|deCatanzaro 1980]], pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and met with strong resistance for his [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace.&lt;ref name="deCatanzaro9-10"/&gt;

=====Western Europe=====
[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil43.jpg|thumb|left|Life of [[Francis of Assisi]] by [[José Benlliure y Gil]] ]]
The [[High Middle Ages]] saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization in western Roman Catholicism, corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as [[Guigo II]], [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the [[Victorines]], all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of [[popular piety]] among the laypeople.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] saw the clash between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] [[school of thought|schools of thought]], which was also a conflict between two different [[mystical theology|mystical theologies]]: on the one hand that of [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzmán]] and on the other that of [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Angela of Foligno]]. This period also saw such individuals as [[John of Ruysbroeck]], [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Catherine of Genoa]], the [[Devotio Moderna]], and such books as the ''[[Theologia Germanica]]'', ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''.

Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered around geographic regions: the [[Beguines]], such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] and [[Hadewijch]] (among others); the [[German mysticism|Rhineland mystics]] [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]] and [[Henry Suso]]; and the English mystics [[Richard Rolle]], [[Walter Hilton]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The [[Spanish mystics]] included [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]] and [[Ignatius Loyola]].

The later post-[[reformation]] period also saw the writings of [[layperson|lay]] visionaries such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[William Blake]], and the foundation of mystical movements such as the [[Quaker]]s. Catholic mysticism continued into the modern period with such figures as [[Padre Pio]] and [[Thomas Merton]].

The [[philokalia]], an ancient method of [[Eastern Orthodox]] mysticism, was promoted by the twentieth century [[Traditionalist School]]. The allegedly inspired or "[[Mediumship|channeled]]" work ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' represents a blending of non-denominational Christian and [[New Age]] ideas.

====Western esotericism and modern spirituality====
{{Main article|Western esotericism|Spirituality|New Age}}

Many western esoteric traditions and elements of modern spirituality have been regarded as "mysticism," such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the [[Fourth Way]],{{sfn|Magee|2016}} and [[Neo-Paganism]]. Modern western spiritually and [[transpersonal psychology]] combine western psycho-therapeutic practices with religious practices like meditation to attain a lasting transformation. Nature mysticism is an intense experience of unification with nature or the cosmic totality, which was popular with Romantic writers.{{sfn|Dupré|2005|p=6342}}

===Jewish mysticism===
{{Jewish mysticism}}
{{Main article|Jewish mysticism|Kabbalah}}

In the common era, Judaism has had two main kinds of mysticism: [[Merkabah mysticism]] and [[Kabbalah]].  The former predated the latter, and was focused on visions, particularly those mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel.  It gets its name from the Hebrew word meaning "chariot", a reference to Ezekiel's vision of a fiery chariot composed of heavenly beings.

Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious [[Ein Sof]] (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation.

Kabbalah originally developed entirely within the realm of [[Jewish thought]]. Kabbalists often use classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings. These teachings are thus held by followers in [[Judaism]] to define the inner meaning of both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and traditional [[Rabbinic literature]], their formerly concealed [[Oral Torah|transmitted]] dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish [[Halakha|religious observances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380313/jewish/Imbued-with-Holiness.htm "Imbued with Holiness"] – The relationship of the esoteric to the [[exoteric]] in the fourfold [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]] interpretation of Torah and existence. From www.kabbalaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabbalah emerged, after earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th to 13th century [[Hachmei Provence|Southern France]] and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]], becoming reinterpreted in the Jewish mystical renaissance of 16th-century [[Safed|Ottoman Palestine]]. It was popularised in the form of [[Hasidic Judaism]] from the 18th century forward. 20th-century interest in Kabbalah has inspired cross-denominational [[Jewish renewal]] and contributed to wider non-Jewish [[New Age|contemporary spirituality]], as well as engaging its [[Gershom Scholem|flourishing emergence]] and historical re-emphasis through newly established [[Jewish studies|academic investigation]].

===Islamic mysticism===
{{Sufism|Persian mysticism}}
{{Main article|Sufism}}

Sufism is said to be Islam's inner and mystical dimension.&lt;ref name="Godlas"&gt;Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, ''Sufism's Many Paths'', 2000, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html University of Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuh Ha Mim Keller, "How would you respond to the claim that Sufism is Bid'a?", 1995. Fatwa accessible at: [http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/sufism.htm Masud.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zubair Fattani, "The meaning of Tasawwuf", Islamic Academy. [http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tasawwuf.htm Islamicacademy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as
{{quote|[A] science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Zarruq, Zaineb Istrabadi, Hamza Yusuf Hanson—"The Principles of Sufism". Amal Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A practitioner of this tradition is nowadays known as a ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūfī}}'' ({{lang|fa|صُوفِيّ}}), or, in earlier usage, a [[dervish]]. The origin of the word "Sufi" is ambiguous. One understanding is that Sufi means wool-wearer; wool wearers during early Islam were pious ascetics who withdrew from urban life. Another explanation of the word "Sufi" is that it means 'purity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seyyedeh Dr. Nahid Angha |url=http://ias.org/sufism/origin-of-word-tasawouf/ |title=origin of the Wrod Tasawouf |publisher=Ias.org |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufis generally belong to a ''[[khalqa]]'', a circle or group, led by a Sheikh or ''[[Murshid]]''. Sufi circles usually belong to a ''[[Tariqa]]'' which is the Sufi order and each has a ''[[Silsila]]'', which is the spiritual lineage, which traces its succession back to notable Sufis of the past, and often ultimately to the last prophet [[Muhammed]] or one of his close associates. The ''turuq'' (plural of ''tariqa'') are not enclosed like Christian monastic orders; rather the members retain an outside life. Membership of a Sufi group often passes down family lines. Meetings may or may not be segregated according to the prevailing custom of the wider society. An existing Muslim faith is not always a requirement for entry, particularly in Western countries.
[[File:Mevlana Konya.jpg|thumb|left|Mawlānā [[Rumi]]'s tomb, [[Konya]], Turkey]]
Sufi practice includes
* ''[[Dhikr]]'', or remembrance (of God), which often takes the form of rhythmic chanting and breathing exercises.
* ''[[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]'', which takes the form of music and dance — the whirling dance of the ''[[Mevlevi]]'' dervishes is a form well known in the West.
* ''[[Muraqaba]]'' or meditation.
* Visiting holy places, particularly the tombs of Sufi saints, in order to remember death and the greatness of those who have passed.

The aims of Sufism include: the experience of ecstatic states (''hal''), purification of the heart (''[[qalb]]''), overcoming the lower self (''[[nafs]]''), extinction of the individual personality (''[[fana (Sufism)|fana]]''), communion with God (''[[haqiqa]]''), and higher knowledge (''[[marifat]]''). Some sufic beliefs and practices have been found unorthodox by other Muslims; for instance [[Mansur al-Hallaj]] was put to death for blasphemy after uttering the phrase ''[[Ana'l Haqq]]'', "I am the Truth" (i.e. God) in a trance.

Notable classical Sufis include [[Jalaluddin Rumi]], [[Fariduddin Attar]], [[Sultan Bahoo]], [[Sayyed Sadique Ali Husaini]], [[Saadi Shirazi]] and [[Hafez]], all major poets in the [[Persian language]]. [[Omar Khayyam]], [[Al-Ghazzali]] and [[Ibn Arabi]] were renowned scholars. [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], [[Moinuddin Chishti]], and [[Bahauddin Naqshband]] founded major orders, as did Rumi. [[Rabia Basri]] was the most prominent female Sufi.

Sufism first came into contact with the Judeo-Christian world during the
[[Moorish]] occupation of [[Spain]]. An interest in Sufism revived in non-Muslim countries during the modern era, led by such figures as [[Inayat Khan]] and [[Idries Shah]] (both in the UK), [[Rene Guenon]] (France) and [[Ivan Aguéli]] (Sweden). Sufism has also long been present in Asian countries that do not have a Muslim majority, such as [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/25/china-xinjiang-sufi-shrines/ Xinjiang Sufi Shrines]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Hinduism====
{{Main article|Hinduism}}

In Hinduism, various [[sadhana]]s aim at overcoming ignorance (''avidhya'') and transcending the limited identification with body, mind and ego to attain ''[[moksha]]''. Hinduism has a number of interlinked [[Sādhanā|ascetic traditions]] and [[Darsanas|philosophical schools]] which aim at [[moksha]]{{sfn|Raju|1992}} and the acquisition of higher powers.{{sfn|White|2012}} With the onset of the British colonisation of India, those traditions came to be interpreted in western terms such as "mysticism", drawing equivalents with western terms and practices.{{sfn|King|2001}}

[[Yoga]] is the [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] practices or disciplines which aim to attain a state of permanent peace.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=10, 457}} Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], Buddhism and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, ''Serene Compassion.''

Classical [[Vedanta]] gives philosophical interpretations and commentaries of the [[Upanishads]], a vast collection of ancient hymns.  At least ten schools of Vedanta are known,{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} of which [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Vishishtadvaita]], and [[Dvaita]] are the best known.{{sfn|Sivananda|1993|p=217}} Advaita Vedanta, as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]], states that there is no difference between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. The best-known subschool is Kevala Vedanta or ''mayavada'' as expounded by [[Adi Shankara]]. Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.{{sfn|King|1999}} In contrast [[Bhedabheda]]-Vedanta emphasizes that Atman and Brahman are both the same and ''not'' the same,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} while [[Dvaita]] Vedanta states that Atman and God are fundamentally different.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} In modern times, the Upanishads have been interpreted by [[Neo-Vedanta]] as being "mystical".{{sfn|King|2001}}

Various [[Shaivism|Shaivist]] traditions are strongly nondualistic, such as [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].

====Tantra====
{{Main article|Tantra}}

Tantra is the name given by scholars to a style of meditation and ritual which arose in [[India]] no later than the fifth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Einoo |first=Shingo (ed.) |year=2009 |page=45 |title=Genesis and Development of Tantrism |publisher=University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantra has influenced the [[Hindu]], [[Bön]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Jain]] traditions and [[silk road transmission of Buddhism|spread with Buddhism]] to [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|White|2000|p=7}} Tantric ritual seeks to access the supra-mundane through the mundane, identifying the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] with the [[macrocosm]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric aim is to sublimate (rather than negate) reality.&lt;ref name=nikhilananda&gt;Nikhilanada (1982), pp. 145–160&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric practitioner seeks to use ''[[prana]]'' (energy flowing through the [[universe]], including one's body) to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both.&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Tantric practice includes visualisation of deities, [[mantra]]s and [[mandala]]s. It can also include sexual and other ([[antinomian]]) practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

{{Main article|Sant (religion)|Nirguna Brahman|Sikhism}}

[[File:Miniature of Guru Nanak from Astronomical treatise.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Guru Nanak]] and [[Bhai Mardana]]]]
Mysticism in the [[Sikh]] [[dharma|dharm]] began with its founder, [[Guru Nanak]], who as a child had profound mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalra|first=Surjit|title=Stories Of Guru Nanak|year=2004|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=9788120912755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guru Nanak stressed that God must be seen with 'the inward eye', or the 'heart', of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lebron|first=Robyn|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There be Common Ground?: A Basic Internet Guide to Forty World Religions &amp; Spiritual Practices|year=2012|publisher=CrossBooks|isbn=9781462712618|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Arjan]], the fifth [[Sikh Guru]], added religious [[bhagat|mystics]] belonging to other religions into the [[Adi Granth|holy scriptures]] that would eventually become the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Presectarian Buddhism|Buddhist meditation|Subitism}}

According to Oliver, Buddhism is mystical in the sense that it aims at the identification of the true nature of our self, and live according to it.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, P. ''Mysticism: A Guide for the Perplexed, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism originated in India, sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries [[Common Era|BCE]], but is now mostly practiced in other countries, where it developed into a number of traditions, the main ones being [[Therevada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]].

Buddhism aims at [[Moksha|liberation]] from the cycle of rebirth by self-control through meditation and morally just behaviour. Some [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist paths]] aim at a gradual development and transformation of the personality toward [[Nirvana]], like the Theravada [[Four stages of enlightenment|stages of enlightenment]]. Others, like the Japanese Rinzai Zen tradition, emphasize [[Subitism|sudden insight]], but nevertheless also prescribe intensive training, including meditation and self-restraint.

Although [[Theravada]] does not acknowledge the existence of a theistic Absolute, it does postulate Nirvana as a transcendent reality which may be attained.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}}{{sfn|Belzen|Geels|2003|p=7}} It further stresses transformation of the personality through meditative practice, self-restraint, and morally just behaviour.{{sfn|Harvey|1995}} According to Richard H. Jones, Theravada is a form of mindful extrovertive and introvertive mysticism, in which the conceptual structuring of experiences is weakened, and the ordinary sense of self is weakened.{{sfn|Jones|2016| p=12 }} It is best known in the west from the [[Vipassana movement]], a number of branches of modern [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism from [[Buddhism in Burma|Burma]], [[Buddhism in Laos|Laos]], [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], and includes contemporary [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist teachers]] such as [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Jack Kornfield]].

Curzon Press 1989, pages 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lankavatara-interpretation, ''tathagata-garbha'' as a potentiality turned into a metaphysical Absolute reality which had to be realised.}} ''Vijñapti-mātra'', coupled with ''[[Buddha-nature]]'' or ''tathagatagarba'', has been an influential concept in the subsequent development of Mahayana Buddhism, not only in India, but also in China and Tibet, most notable in the Chán (Zen) and Dzogchen traditions.

Chinese and Japanese Zen is grounded on the Chinese understanding of the [[Buddha-nature]] as one true's essence, and the [[Two truths doctrine]] as a polarity between relative and Absolute reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Zen aims at insight one's true nature, or [[Buddha-nature]], thereby manifesting Absolute reality in the relative reality.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005a|p=168}} In Soto, this Buddha-nature is regarded to be ever-present, and [[shikan-taza]], sitting meditation, is the expression of the already existing Buddhahood.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} Rinzai-zen emphasises the need for a [[Kensho|break-through insight]] in this Buddha-nature,{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} but also stresses that further practice is needed to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life,{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|Glassman|2007|p=54, 140}} as expressed in the [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]].{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} The Japanese Zen-scholar [[D.T.

The Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] tradition is based on Madhyamaka philosophy and Tantra.{{sfn|Newman|2001|p=587}} In deity yoga, visualizations of deities are eventually dissolved, to realize the inherent [[sunyata|emptiness]] of every-'thing' that exists.{{sfn|Harding|1996|p=16–20}} [[Dzogchen]], which is being taught in both the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan buddhist]] [[Nyingma]] school and the [[Bön]] tradition,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Dzogchen Rigpa Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on direct insight into our real nature. It holds that "mind-nature" is manifested when one is enlightened,{{sfn|Klein|Tenzin Wangyal|2006|p=4}} being nonconceptually aware (''[[rigpa]]'', "open presence") of one's nature,{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=265}} "a recognition of one's beginningless nature."{{sfn|Klein|2011|p=272}} [[Mahamudra]] has similarities with Dzogchen, emphasizing the meditational approach to insight and liberation.

===Taoism===
{{Main article|Taoism}}

Taoist philosophy is centered on the ''Tao'', usually translated "Way", an ineffable cosmic principle. The contrasting yet interdependent concepts of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]'' and ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' also symbolise harmony, with Taoist scriptures often emphasing the ''Yin'' virtues of femininity, passivity and yieldingness.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysticism: A guide for the Perplexed''. Oliver, P.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist practice includes exercises and rituals aimed at manipulating the life force ''[[Qi]]'', and obtaining health and longevity.{{refn|group=note|Extending to physical immortality: the Taoist pantheon includes ''[[Xian (Taoism)|Xian]]'', or immortals.}} These have been elaborated into practices such as ''[[Tai chi]]'', which are well known in the west.

===The Secularization of Mysticism===
{{see also|New Age}}

Today there is also occurring in the West what Richard Jones calls "the secularization of mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones, ''Philosophy of Mysticism'' (SUNY Press, 2016), epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt; That is the separation of meditation and other mystical practices from their traditional use in religious ways of life to only secular ends of purported psychological and physiological benefits.

==Scholarly approaches of mysticism and mystical experience==
{{Main article|Scholarly approaches of mysticism}}

===Types of mysticism===
[[R. C. Zaehner]] distinguishes three fundamental types of mysticism, namely theistic, monistic and panenhenic ("all-in-one") or natural mysticism.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The theistic category includes most forms of Jewish, Christian and Islamic mysticism and occasional Hindu examples such as Ramanuja and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} The monistic type, which according to Zaehner is based upon an experience of the unity of one's soul,{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{refn|group=note|Compare the work of [[C.G. Jung]].}} includes Buddhism and Hindu schools such as [[Samhya]] and [[Advaita vedanta]].{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Nature mysticism seems to refer to examples that do not fit into one of these two categories.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}

[[Walter Terence Stace]], in his book ''Mysticism and Philosophy'' (1960), distinguished two types of mystical experience, namely extrovertive and introvertive mysticism.{{sfn|Stace|1960|p=chap. 1}}{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}}{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} Extrovertive mysticism is an experience of the unity of the external world, whereas introvertive mysticism is "an experience of unity devoid of perceptual objects; it is literally an experience of 'no-thing-ness'."{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=291}} The unity in extrovertive mysticism is with the totality of objects of perception. While perception stays continuous, “unity shines through the same world”; the unity in introvertive mysticism is with a pure consciousness, devoid of objects of perception,{{sfn|Hood|2003|p=292}} “pure unitary consciousness, wherein awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-451-60306-0|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stace such experiences are nonsensous and nonintellectual, under a total “suppression of the whole empirical content.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=The Teachings of the Mystics|date=1960|publisher=The New American Library|location=New York|isbn= 0-451-60306-0|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace argues that doctrinal differences between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Paden|2009|p=332}} Stace argues that mysticism is part of the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is perceived, and only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.&lt;ref name="Mysticism and Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stace|first1=Walter|title=Mysticism and Philosophy|date=1960|publisher=MacMillan|pages=44–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mystical experiences===
Since the 19th century, '''mystical experience''' has evolved as a distinctive concept. It is closely related to "mysticism" but lays sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior, whereas mysticism encompasses a broad range of practices aiming at a transformation of the person, not just inducing mystical experiences.

[[William James]]' ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is the classic study on religious or mystical experience, which influenced deeply both the academic and popular understanding of "religious experience".{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} He popularized the use of the term "religious experience"{{refn|group=note|The term "mystical experience" has become synonymous with the terms "religious experience", [[spirituality|spiritual]] experience and [[sacred]] experience.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}}}} in his "Varieties",{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} and influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge of the transcendental:{{sfn|Harmless|2007|pp=10–17}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}
{{quote|Under the influence of William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, heavily centered on people's conversion experiences, most philosophers' interest in mysticism has been in distinctive, allegedly knowledge-granting "mystical experiences.""{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}}}

Yet, Gelman notes that so-called mystical experience is not a transitional event, as William James claimed, but an "abiding consciousness, accompanying a person throughout the day, or parts of it. For that reason, it might be better to speak of mystical consciousness, which can be either fleeting or abiding."{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}}

Most mystical traditions warn against an attachment to mystical experiences, and offer a "protective and hermeneutic framework" to accommodate these experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} These same traditions offer the means to induce mystical experiences,{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} which may have several origins:
* Spontaneous; either apparently without any cause, or by persistent existential concerns, or by neurophysiological origins;
* Religious practices, such as [[contemplation]], [[meditation]], and [[mantra]]-repetition;
* Entheogens (psychedelic drugs)
* Neurophysiological origins, such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

The theoretical study of mystical experience has shifted from an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and empirical approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, takes into account the historical and cultural context.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}}{{r|SEP_Gelman_Mysticism|group=web}} Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.

===Perennialism versus constructionism===
The term "mystical experience" evolved as a distinctive concept since the 19th century, laying sole emphasis on the experiential aspect, be it spontaneous or induced by human behavior. Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof. In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the context in which they emerge.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Well-known representatives are William James, R.C. Zaehner, William Stace and Robert Forman.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=269, note 9}} but "has lost none of its popularity."{{sfn|McMahan|2010|p=269, note 9}}

In contrast, for the past decades most scholars have favored a constructionist approach, which states that mystical experiences are fully constructed by the ideas, symbols and practices that mystics are familiar with.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6356–6357}} Critics of the term "religious experience" note that the notion of "religious experience" or "mystical experience" as marking insight into religious truth is a modern development,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} and contemporary researchers of mysticism note that mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts "which the mystic brings to, and which shape, his experience".{{sfn|Katz|2000|p=3}} What is being experienced is being determined by the expectations and the conceptual background of the mystic.{{sfn|Katz|2000|pp=3–4}}

Richard Jones draws a distinction between "anticonstructivism" and "perennialism": constructivism can be rejected with respect to a certain class of mystical experiences without ascribing to a perennialist philosophy on the relation of mystical doctrines.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 2; also see Jensine Andresen, "Introduction: Towards  a Cognitive Science of Religion," in Jensine Andresen, ed., ''Religion in Mind''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.}} One can reject constructivism without claiming that mystical experiences reveal a cross-cultural "perennial truth". For example, a Christian can reject both constructivism and perennialism in arguing that there is a union with God free of cultural construction. Constructivism versus anticonstructivism is a matter of the nature of ''mystical experiences'' while perennialism is a matter of ''mystical traditions and the doctrines they espouse''.

===Contextualism and attribution theory===
{{Main article|Attribution (psychology)|Neurotheology}}

The contextual approach has become the common approach.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} Contextualism takes into account the historical and cultural context of mystical experiences.{{sfn|Moore|2005|p=6357}} The attribution approach views "mystical experience" as non-ordinary states of consciousness which are explained in a religious framework.{{sfn|Taves|2009}} According to Proudfoot, mystics unconsciously merely attribute a doctrinal content to ordinary experiences. That is, mystics project cognitive content onto otherwise ordinary experiences having a strong emotional impact.{{sfn|Proudfoot|1985}}{{sfn|Taves|2009}} This approach has been further elaborated by [[Ann Taves]], in her ''[[Religious Experience Reconsidered]]''. She incorporates both [[Neurotheology|neurological]] and cultural approaches in the study of mystical experience.

===Neurological research===
{{See also|Neurotheology}}

Neurological research takes an empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.{{sfn|Newberg|d'Aquili|2008}}{{sfn|Newberg|Waldman|2009}} This leads to a central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural correlates of mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences are no more than brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.{{sfn|Jones|2016|loc=chapter 4}}

Interest in mystical experiences and psychedelic drugs has also recently seen a resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{Harvnb|Richards|2015}}; {{Harvnb|Osto|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temporal lobe]] seems to be involved in mystical experiences,&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 14 November 2015 | url = http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | title = The Neurophysiology of the Brain: Its Relationship to Altered States of Consciousness (With emphasis on the Mystical Experience) | author = Peter Fenwick | year = 1980 | publisher = Wrekin Trust | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160214151842/http://www.slideshare.net/dominic54/artikel-5593315 | archive-date = 14 February 2016 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Picard|2013}} and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; It generates the feeling of "I," and gives a feeling of familiarity or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses.&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt; There is a long-standing notion that epilepsy and religion are linked,{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}} and [[List of people with epilepsy#Religious figures|some religious figures]] may have had [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).&lt;ref group=web name="Fenwick1980" /&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|1953}}{{sfn|Leuba|1925}}{{sfn|Devinsky|2003}}

The [[anterior insula]] may be involved in [[ineffability]], a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words, which is a common quality in mystical experiences. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the [[anterior insula]], a part of the brain which is involved in [[interoception]], self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk".{{sfn|Picard|2013|p=2496–2498}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://www.worldcrunch.com/tech-science/can-epilepsy-unlock-the-secret-to-happiness-/epilepsy-happiness-brain-fabienne-picard/c4s13429/ Francesca Sacco (2013-09-19), ''Can Epilepsy Unlock The Secret To Happiness?'', Le Temps]}}

===Mysticism and morality===
A philosophical issue in the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to [[morality]]. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Danto 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Stace 1960, pp. 323–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is not as simple as that.{{sfn|Barnard|Kripal|2002}}{{sfn|Jones|2004}}

Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism – that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences – serves to exclude it from political issues as social justice. Mysticism thus becomes seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10140">The '''Pan American Association of Anatomy''' ('''PAA''') is a public, nonprofit, scientific organization that brings together professionals engaged in the study of [[Anatomy]] and related sciences in the American continent.

==Origins and objectives==
The Pan American Association of Anatomy (PAA) was created in July 1966 in [[Mexico City]] at the 1st Pan American Congress of Anatomy, which was held together with the 3rd National Congress of the Mexican Society of Anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socmexanat.com Official Web Mexican Society of Anatomy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217082929/http://www.socmexanat.com/ |date=2010-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mentor was the Prof. Dr. Liberato J. A. Didio.

The need for a Pan American Association of Anatomy was proposed by Prof. Di Dio during the 74th meeting of the American Association of Anatomy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anatomy.org Official Web American Association of Anatomy]&lt;/ref&gt; held in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], USA, in March 1961.

Its objectives include stimulating the development and improvement of [[teaching]] and [[research]] of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological sciences]] on the American continent, facilitating scientific exchange in all its aspects. Since then and through its meetings, it has spread and updated progress of morphological sciences on the American continent.

==Organizational structure==
The PAA is a member of the [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaa.net Official Web IFAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Pan American Association of Anatomy consists on the General Assembly (performed with partners in the Congress), the Board of Directors (composed by advisers or delegates from each country) and the Executive Committee (headed by the President, who is elected by the General Assembly).

There are two counselors or delegates for each American country concerned; one as owner and another alternate.

When the mandate of the President of the Executive Committee is finished, he is named Honorary President of the Association and he automatically joins the Honorary Presidents Committee of the PAA, which works with the Executive Committee.

The headquarters of the congresses vary from one congress to another, but they are always within the Americas and in a rotative form. The designation of the host country is resolved at the General Assembly by a vote of its partners and it is usually held every 3 years.

Since 2013, the Association Executive Committee has been chaired by Prof. Dr. Manuel Arteaga Martínez, from Mexico (2013–2017). The next Pan-American Congress of Anatomy will be held in [[Peru]], 2017; its President is Prof. Dr. Germán Molina Albornoz, from Peru.

The statutes of the Association and the Pan American Congress of Anatomy, adopted by majority vote by the General Assembly of the Association, can be found on the.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apanatomia.weebly.com PAA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pan American Congress==
In 50 years of Association life, 18 congresses have been held, with an interval of 3 years (sometimes 2 years) between them. The following countries have hosted at least one congress: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela.

The Congress covers various topics of morphological sciences and related sciences that have application to the [[biology]] and health sciences, especially in medicine and dentistry. It involves research, teaching and medical care. In particular, issues related to [[development anatomy]] ([[embryology]]), [[microscopic anatomy]] ([[histology]] and [[cell biology|Citology]]), [[human anatomy]], [[veterinary anatomy]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[neurobiology]], radiological anatomy, clinical anatomy, [[anthropology]], [[biophysics]] and [[biochemistry]], etc. are discussed.

==Symposia Iberian-Latin-American==
In 2009, during the 43rd anniversary of the Pan American Association of Anatomy, the 1st Iberian-Latin-American Terminology Symposium (SILAT) was held, with the purpose of disseminating the [[International Morphological Terminology]]. [[Educational institutions]] of medical and other health areas which spoke Spanish and Portuguese used it on a daily basis. Its mentor was Prof. Dr. Rolando Cruz Gutiérrez.

Up today, there have been sixteen symposia: four in [[Costa Rica]], two in [[Brasil]], three in [[Mexico]], four in [[Chile]], two in [[Peru]] and one in [[Nicaragua]]. In these symposia, participants are divided into groups to work with the anatomical, histological and embryological terminology from the [[Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology|Terminology Committee]] ([[FICAT]]) of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). Meetings are held every day. The symposia also develops the presentation of free papers concerning different aspects and considerations of terminology.

These groups of experts review, analyse and discuss the morphological terms; possible errors and defects in the studied structures are also discussed. It was determined that the future meetings are planned in other countries (such as Honduras, Ecuador, Argentina, etc.).

'''Pan law''', or '''pan rule''', is a [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and [[mixing console|mixing]] principle that states that any signal of equal [[amplitude]] and [[Phase_(waves)|phase]] that is played in both channels of a [[stereo system]] will increase in [[loudness]] up to 6.02 [[dBSPL]], provided there is perfect response in the loudspeaker system and perfect [[acoustics]] in the room.

Often, the acoustic summing of a room and system are much inferior to the ideal, so the specific relative level will change from −3 dB to 0 dB as the mono signal is [[Panning_(audio)|panned]] from [[center channel|center]] to hard left or right, and this sounds natural. The idea is that when one directs signals left and right with the [[Panning_(audio)|pan pot]], the perceived loudness will stay the same, regardless of latitude.

However, both the direction of [[attenuation]] throughout the panoramic sweep and the amount by which the signal is attenuated vary according to pan rule. For example, the Yamaha digital consoles employ a typical (compromise) 3 dB pan rule, however, the signal is at full level at 12:00 and becomes progressively louder (up to + 3 dB) as it is panned to the right or left.

The 3 dB pan rule is a commonly applied compromise to comply with the mediocre acoustic summing capabilities of most control rooms. However, the [[console manufacturer]] SSL used to employ a 4.5 dB pan rule, because it was believed that their expensive consoles would normally be used in tuned rooms that had acoustic summing capabilities closer to the ideal.

Many consoles that have only one pan rule employ one such that a signal panned hard left or right is at full level and becomes progressively lower in level as the pan is directed to the center.

According to mastering engineer Glenn Meadows, the Kinoshita-Hidley rooms at Masterfonics ([[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]), produce close to 5.9 dB acoustic summing when both loudspeakers are presented with the same in-phase signal.

A '''queen post''' is a [[Tension (physics)|tension]] member in a [[truss]] that can span longer openings than a [[king post]] truss. A king post uses one central supporting post, whereas the queen post truss uses two.&lt;ref&gt;Gopi, Satheesh. Basic civil engineering. New Delhi: Dorling Kindersley (India) Pvt. Ltd., 2010. 155. Print. {{ISBN|8131729885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it is a tension member, rather than a compression member, they are commonly still called a [[Post (structural)|post]]. A queen post is often confused with a queen strut, one of two [[Compression (physical)|compression]] members in roof [[Framing (construction)|framing]] which do not form a truss in the engineering sense.&lt;ref&gt;"Timber Framing for Beginners: VI.

[[File:Queens Post P2100014 Day Bridge off Prosperity Pike (SR 18) PA.jpg|thumb|right|280 px|Day Bridge in Southwestern Pennsylvania (Morgan Township, Green County)]]

==Architecture==
A queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed about one-third of the way from each end of the truss. They are connected across the top by a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] and use a diagonal brace between the outer edges. The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two diagonal braces for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two diagonal braces may either reach from the bottom of each upright post to the center of the upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner "X" inside the square.&lt;ref&gt;American Barns and Covered Bridges, Eric Sloane, Wilfred Funk, Inc.

'''Rectal douching''' (also known as '''anal douching''') is the act of rinsing the [[rectum]] with intent to clean it, typically in preparation for [[anal sex]]. An instance of this rinsing or a tool used to perform the rinse may be called a '''rectal douche'''.

==Uses==
Rectal douching is a [[hygienic]] practice to clean the rectum in preparation for anal sex or hydrating the rectum to void hardened stools as opposed to a pharmaceutical method to soften the stool.

Rectal douching is distinguished from [[anal cleansing]], which is the routine cleaning of the [[anus]] after [[defecation]], and [[enema]], which is the rinsing of part of the [[large intestine]].

==Risks==
Evidence is not clear, but it is possible that rectal douching before [[anal sex]] can increase the risk of transferring [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carballo-Diéguez|first1=Alex|last2=Bauermeister|first2=José A.|last3=Ventuneac|first3=Ana|last4=Dolezal|first4=Curtis|last5=Balan|first5=Ivan|last6=Remien|first6=Robert H.|title=The Use of Rectal Douches among HIV-uninfected and Infected Men who Have Unprotected Receptive Anal Intercourse: Implications for Rectal Microbicides|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=12|issue=6|year=2007|pages=860–866|issn=1090-7165|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9301-0|pmc=2953367}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that douching sometimes can disrupt the [[epithelium]], or tissue in the rectum, and if this tissue is damaged then HIV can spread more easily.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"/&gt;

Rectal douching before anal sex increases the risk of transfer of [[Hepatitis B]].&lt;ref name="SchreederThompson1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreeder|first1=M. T.|last2=Thompson|first2=S. E.|last3=Hadler|first3=S. C.|last4=Berquist|first4=K. R.|last5=Zaidi|first5=A.|last6=Maynard|first6=J. E.|last7=Ostrow|first7=D.|last8=Judson|first8=F. N.|last9=Braff|first9=E.

There are reports that activities which can have the side effect of causing unintentional forcing of water into the rectum, such as [[waterskiing]], may cause discomfort but can potentially bring other harms.&lt;ref name="Kizer1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kizer|first1=Kenneth W.|title=Medical hazards of the water skiing douche|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=5|year=1980|pages=268–269|issn=0196-0644|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(80)80387-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Rectal bulb syringe.jpg|thumb|right|The nozzle tip is inserted into the rectum then the bulb is squeezed to release water.]]
Liquid, typically water, is inserted into the rectum by means of some tool. After some time, the water is expelled in the manner of a routine bowel movement, and in the process the rectum eliminates waste and becomes more clean.

Most people who use rectal douching do so with plain water.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; The use of a hose connected to a tap, either in a shower or sink, has been reported as the most popular way to administer a douche.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; Another popular way is with a handheld bulb and syringe designed for rectal douching.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

Less commonly, some people used commercial products sold for performing rectal douching, with single-use bottles of saline being most used.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt; Also commercially available but even less commonly used for rectal douching are mineral oil products intended to assist in an enema.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

==Frequency of use==
Rectal douching is a common practice among people who take a receptive role in anal sex.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Javanbakht|first1=Marjan|last2=Stahlman|first2=Shauna|last3=Pickett|first3=Jim|last4=LeBlanc|first4=Marc-André|last5=Gorbach|first5=Pamina M|title=Prevalence and types of rectal douches used for anal intercourse: results from an international survey|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|volume=14|issue=1|year=2014|pages=95|issn=1471-2334|doi=10.1186/1471-2334-14-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2014 study of about 5000 gay males in the United States reported that half of them had used douching at least once and most used tap water.&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=SW|last2=Rosser|first2=BR|title=Enema use among men who have sex with men: a behavioral epidemiologic study with implications for HIV/STI prevention.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=May 2014|volume=43|issue=4|pages=755–69|pmid=24346864|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0203-0|pmc=4011986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among study participants, those who were [[people of color]], [[HIV-positive people]], with a [[sexually transmitted infection]], [[Top, bottom and versatile#Versatile|sexually versatile]], or who in their lifetime had unprotected sex with more than two partners were more likely to have recently used rectal douching.&lt;ref name="Noor"/&gt;

One small study of gay males included a survey in which respondents who habitually used rectal douching began doing it regularly around age 25.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2007"/&gt; For all demographics, the average age at which a population might start using rectal douching is older than the average age at which that population started engaging in anal sex.&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

==History==
A rectal douche device was patented in 1957 in the United States by [[Patricia Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = US2811156 A | status = patent | title = Rectal douche | pubdate = 29 October 1957 | gdate = | fdate = 2 December 1955 | pridate = 2 December 1955 | inventor = [[Patricia Bragg]] | invent1 =  | invent2 =  | assign1 =  | assign2 =  | class = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
From a public health perspective, understanding rectal douching practices may be important because the practice can be paired with behaviors which are [[risk factors]] to acquiring a [[sexually transmitted infection]].&lt;ref name="JavanbakhtStahlman2014"/&gt;

==Research==
Research into [[rectal microbicide]] to prevent the transmission of [[HIV]] increased interest into researching safer and more gentle rectal douching techniques.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carballo-Diéguez|first1=Alex|last2=Bauermeister|first2=José|last3=Ventuneac|first3=Ana|last4=Dolezal|first4=Curtis|last5=Mayer|first5=Kenneth|title=Why Rectal Douches May Be Acceptable Rectal-Microbicide Delivery Vehicles for Men Who Have Sex With Men|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|year=2009|pages=1|issn=0148-5717|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181bf9b2d|pmc=2891180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope in that research is that a rectal microbicide could be delivered with a rectal douche.&lt;ref name="Carballo-DiéguezBauermeister2009"/&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set of possible `states of the world' or `alternatives';  society wishes to choose some state from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set, representing a collection of people.  For each &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;u_i:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a ''[[utility|utility function]]''.  A ''[[social choice theory|social choice rule]]'' (or ''[[voting system]]'') is a mechanism which uses the data &lt;math&gt;(u_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; to select some element(s) from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which are `best' for society.  (The basic problem of [[social choice theory]] is to disambiguate the word `best'.)

The classic [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] social choice rule selects the element &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes the ''utilitarian sum''

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; U(x):= \sum_{i\in I} u_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

However, for this formula to make sense, we must assume that the utility functions &lt;math&gt;(u_i)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; are both [[cardinal utility|cardinal]], and [[social choice theory#Interpersonal utility comparison|interpersonally comparable]] at a cardinal level.

The notion that individuals have cardinal utility functions is not that problematic.  Cardinal utility has been implicitly assumed in [[decision theory]] ever since [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s analysis of the [[Saint Petersburg Paradox]].  Rigorous mathematical theories of cardinal utility (with application to risky decision making) were developed by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|Bruno de Finetti]],
[[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|von Neumann and Morgenstern]], and [[Subjective expected utility|Leonard Savage]].  However, in these theories, a person's utility function is only well-defined up to an `affine rescaling'.  Thus, if the utility function &lt;math&gt;u_i:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is valid description of her preferences, and if &lt;math&gt;r_i,s_i\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are two constants with &lt;math&gt;s_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then the `rescaled' utility function &lt;math&gt;v_i(x) := s_i\, u_i(x) +  r_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equally valid description of her preferences.  If we define a new package of utility functions &lt;math&gt;(v_i)_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; using possibly different &lt;math&gt;r_i\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and we then consider the utilitarian sum

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; V(x):= \sum_{i\in I} v_i(x),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then in general, the maximizer of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; will ''not'' be the same as the maximizer of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, in a sense, classic utilitarian social choice is not well-defined within the standard model of cardinal utility used in decision theory, unless we specify some mechanism to `calibrate' the utility functions of the different individuals.

''Relative utilitarianism'' proposes a natural calibration mechanism.  For every &lt;math&gt;i \in I &lt;/math&gt;, suppose that the values

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; m_i \ := \ \min_{x \in X} \, u_i(x) \quad \mbox{and}\quad M_i \ := \ \max_{x \in X} \, u_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

are well-defined.  (For example, this will always be true if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite, or if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact space and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function.)   Then define

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;w_i(x) \ :=  \ \frac{u_i(x) - m_i}{M_i - m_i}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;w_i:X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a `rescaled' utility function which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.  The Relative Utilitarian social choice rule selects the element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes the utilitarian sum

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; W(x):= \sum_{i\in I} w_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

As an abstract social choice function, relative utilitarianism has been analyzed by Cao (1982), Dhillon (1998), Karni (1998), Dhillon and Mertens (1999), Segal (2000), Sobel (2001) and Pivato (2008). (Cao (1982) refers to it as the `modified Thomson solution'.)  When interpreted as a `voting rule', it is equivalent to [[Range voting]].

'''Religion and peacebuilding''' refers to the study of religion's role in the development of peace. Scholars generally accept that religion has been, at different points in history, both advantageous and [[religion and violence|ruinous to the promotion of peace]]&lt;ref&gt;John Siebert, "Religion and Violent Conflict: A Practitioner's Functional Approach," The Ploughshares Monitor, Vol 28, No.2 (Summer 2007),pp9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many approaches to explaining this variability.

Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner categorize these approaches into three models. The first is “peace through religion alone”. This proposes to attain world peace through devotion to a given religion. Opponents claim that advocates generally want to attain peace through their particular religion only and have little tolerance of other ideologies. 
The second model, a response to the first, is “peace without religion”. Critics claim that it is overly simplistic and fails to address other causes of conflict as well as the peace potential of religion. It is also said that this model excludes the many contributions of religious people in the development of peace. Another critique claims that both approaches require bringing everyone into their own ideology.

The third and final approach is known as “peace with religion”. This approach focuses on the importance of coexistence and interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner, "Religion and Peace and COnflict Studies," in Critical Issues in Peace and Conflict Studies, ed. Thomas Matyok, Jessica Senehi, and Sean Byrne (Toronto: Lexington Books, 2011), pp 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrie ter Haar suggests that religion is neither inherently good nor bad for peace, and that its influence is undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie ter Haar, "Religion: Source of Conflict or Resource for Peace?" in Bridge or Barrier: Religion, Violence and Visions for Peace, ed. Gerrie ter Haar and James J. Busuttil (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2005), pp. 18-36&lt;/ref&gt; Peace with religion, then, emphasises promoting the common principles present in every major religion.

A major component of religion and peacebuilding is faith-based [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Douglas Johnston points out that faith-based NGOs offer two distinct advantages. The first is that since faith-based NGOs are very often locally based, they have immediate influence within that community. He argues that “it is important to promote indigenous ownership of conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives as early in the process as possible.” The second advantage Johnston presents is that faith-based NGOs carry [[moral authority]] that contributes to the receptivity of negotiations and policies for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Johnston, "Faith-Based Organizations: The Religious Dimension of Peacebuilding." in People Building Peace II: Successful Stories of Civil Society, ed Paul van Tongeren, et al (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 2005), pp. 209-218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism and peacebuilding==

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew Bible contains many sources for religious peacebuilding. Some of which include:

*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land"
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: '''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close"
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|11:5|HE}}: The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it"
*{{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:17-18|HE}}:" The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together;and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
* {{Bible verse||Isaiah|2:4|121}} &amp; {{Bible verse||Micah|4:3|121}} They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.

===Project Ploughshares===
{{Main|Project Ploughshares}}
[[Project Ploughshares]] is a Canadian non-government organization concerned with the prevention of war, the [[disarmament]] of weapons, and peacebuilding. Though it is an agency of the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] and is sponsored by the nine national churches of Canada, Project Ploughshares is run by and for people of a variety of different faith backgrounds. Project Ploughshares works with various NGOs operating abroad to develop research and complete analyses of government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/faq#FAQ5|title=FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Project Ploughshares' work has included meeting with prime ministers to discuss nuclear disarmament, establishing and coordinating an agency for disarmament and security of the Horn in Africa, working with the UN and NATO on policy-making, and publishing research papers, one of which was endorsed by over 40 000 Canadians and had a serious influence over Canada's decision not to declare war on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/accomplishments|title=Accomplishments|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Ploughshares takes its name from Isaiah 2:4 where it is written "God shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their [[swords into ploughshares]], and spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pax Christi===
{{Main|Pax Christi}}
[[Pax Christi]] is the "official international Catholic peace movement" as recognized by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Marie, [http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html “Pax Christi International”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304180629/http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html |date=2014-03-04 }} ‘’CMSM Forum," Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded after [[World War II]] as reconciliary movement by French citizens including Bishop [[Pierre-Marie Théas]] of [[Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes|Tarbes and Lourdes]]. First goal was the reconciliation between [[France]] and [[Germany]]; the German branch or section later concentrated on reconciliation with [[Poland]] and initiated the foundation of the [[:de:Maximilian-Kolbe-Werk]].

Today the Pax Christi network membership is made up of 18 national sections and 115 Member Organizations working in over 50 countries,
focusing on five main issues: human rights, human security, disarmament and demilitarisation, just world order, and religion and peace.

==The Bahá'í Faith and peacebuilding==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] requires believers to avoid prejudice in daily life, to be friendly to people of all [[religions]], social statuses, nationalities or various [[culture|cultural]] traditions. At the nation's level, it calls for negotiation and dialogue between country leaders, to promote the process of world peace. For world peace, the Bahá'í Faith has the notion of "the Lesser Peace" and "the Great Peace". The previous one is considered the level of political peace, that a peace treaty is signed, and wars are eliminated; the latter refers to [[God]]'s kingdom on earth, the world reaches its unity and in cooperation, all world's people uses an auxiliary language, a unified currency system, achieves economic justice, a world tribunal is available, and massive disarmament of all countries.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], discouraged all forms of violence, including religious violence, writing that his aim was to: ``quench the flame of hate and enmity" and that the ``religion of God is for love and unity; make it not the cause of enmity or dissension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kitab-i-Ahd|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of the dangers of religious fanaticism describing it as a ``world devouring fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=288|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited holy war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Bisharat|pages=21|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned the shedding of blood, the burning of books, the shunning of the followers of other religions and the extermination of communities and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of the World|pages=91|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] promoted the concept of the oneness of the world and human beings describing the Earth as "but one country, and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of Maqsud|pages=167|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] identified the elimination of disunity as a necessary pre-requisite to peace.  "The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=286|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, as a contribution to the 1986 International Year of Peace, the international governing body of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[the Universal House of Justice]], released a major statement on the promotion of peace, that was distributed worldwide by the Bahá'í community. The statement sets out an analysis and strategy for creation of a more peaceful world. It identifies the following barriers to peace: racism, economic injustice, uncontrolled nationalism, religious strife, inequality between man and women, an absence of universal education, and the need for an international auxiliary language. The statement concludes with a call for establishment of the "oneness of humanity", a call which implies "no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Promise of World Peace|url=http://www.bahai.org/documents/the-universal-house-of-justice/promise-world-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism and peacebuilding==

===Engaged Buddhism===
{{Main|Engaged Buddhism}}

'''Engaged Buddhism''' is a term coined by [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] in the 1960s to describe a more socially active form of Buddhism. Originating during the [[Indochina Wars]] with Nhat Hanh and the [[Unified Buddhist Church]], adherents of Engaged Buddhism became participants in the war, not against the Americans or the Vietnamese, but against the violence itself, which they saw as unnecessary. They attempted to draw attention to the injustices of the war by placing themselves directly between the lines of battle and even engaging in [[self immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp38-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged Buddhism represents a socially aware non-violent movement within the larger Buddhist community. Inspired by the Buddhist tradition of the Peace Wheel and the teachings of non-violence of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], Engaged Buddhism has since spread to other conflicts in other countries, with groups in Tibet, struggling for self-determination; in Burma and Cambodia, advocating for human rights; in [[Sri Lanka]], promoting the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]]; and in India, working with [[Dalit|untouchables]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp39&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also since opened up churches in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

Repetition priming can occur without a person being aware of either the repeats or the improvements in his/her response, so it is generally thought to involve [[implicit memory]] processes that are dissociable from [[explicit memory]] processes.&lt;ref name="Rugg 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rugg|first1=M.D|last2=Mark|first2=R.E|last3=Walla|first3=P|last4=Schloerscheidt|first4=A.M|last5=Birch|first5=C.S|last6=Allan|first6=K|title=Dissociation of the neural correlates of implicit and explicit memory|journal=Nature|date=1998|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=595–598|doi=10.1038/33396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has support from findings that [[amnesic]] patients with damage to [[limbic]] and/or [[diencephalic]] structures show measurable repetition priming effects but have deficits on explicit measures of memory.&lt;ref name="Kinder &amp; Shanks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinder|first1=A|last2=Shanks|first2=D.R|title=Amnesia and the declarative/nondeclarative distinction: A recurrent network model of classification, recognition, and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2001|volume=13|issue=5|pages=648–669|doi=10.1162/089892901750363217|pmid=11506662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleischman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleischman|first1=D.A|title=Repetition priming in aging and Alzheimer's disease: an integrative review and future directions|journal=Cortex|date=2007|volume=43|issue=7|pages=889–897|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some researchers suggest that implicit and explicit memory systems are not in fact separate.&lt;ref name=Reder&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reder|first1=L.M|last2=Park|first2=H|last3=Kieffaber|first3=P.D|title=Memory systems do not divide on consciousness: Reinterpreting memory in terms of activation and binding|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=1|pages=23–49|doi=10.1037/a0013974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition priming has also been associated with attentional processes,&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=J|last2=Smith|first2=A.T|title=fMRI repetition suppression: neuronal adaptation or stimulus expectation?|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2012|volume=22|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr119|pmc=3278317}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulus expectation&lt;ref name=Summerfield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Summerfield|first1=C|last2=Egner|first2=T|last3=Greene|first3=M|last4=Koechlin|first4=E|last5=Mangels|first5=J|last6=Hirsch|first6=J|title=Predictive codes for forthcoming perception in the frontal cortex|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=314|issue=5803|pages=1311–1314|doi=10.1126/science.1132028|pmid=17124325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=W.T|title=Episodic retrieval in negative priming and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1291–3105|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.6.1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into repetition priming has been used to investigate the nature of mechanisms underlying the behavioural effects of rapid learning.  In utilizing measures of ''repetition suppression'', the putative neural correlate of repetition priming, and measuring changes in the neural response associated with changing the presented stimuli, researchers are attempting to index regions and their processing biases along perceptual, conceptual and response dimensions.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Malach|first2=R|title=fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons|journal=Acta Psychologia|date=2001|volume=107|issue=1|pages=293–321|doi=10.1016/s0001-6918(01)00019-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This area of research is based on multiple measurement methods from single cell recordings&lt;ref name=Sobotka&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobotka|first1=S|last2=Ringo|first2=J.L|title=Stimulus specific adaptation in excited but not in inhibited cells in inferotemporal cortex of macaque|journal=Brain Research|date=1994|volume=646|pages=95–99|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)90061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to multi-regional measurements using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI),&lt;ref name="Buckner &amp; Koustaal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckner|first1=R.L|last2=Koustaal|first2=W|title=Functional neuroimaging studies of encoding, priming, and explicit memory retrieval|journal=Proc.

== Theories and models ==
Numerous models have been put forward to explain behavioural efficiencies that are gained with repeated presentations of the same or similar stimuli.  These are outlined below.

===''Fatigue''===
In this model the attenuation of a neural response is hypothesised to be due to an overall reduction in the [[amplitude]] of a neuron's firing.&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=A|last2=Movshon|first2=J.A|title=Neuronal adaptation to visual motion in area MT of the macaque|journal=Neuron|date=2003|volume=39|issue=4|pages=681–691|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether this reduction occurs across all neurons that responded to the initial stimulus or just the critical subset of those that initially responded maximally, is still unclear.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Henson|first2=R|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evidence does suggest that a mechanism like this reduces redundant neural firing and enhances efficiencies in processing in the early visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dragoi|first1=V|last2=Sharma|first2=J|last3=Miller|first3=E.K|last4=Sur|first4=M|title=Dynamics of neuronal sensitivity in visual cortex and local feature discrimination|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=2002|volume=5|issue=9|pages=883–891|doi=10.1038/nn900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sharpening''===
Along similar lines is the idea that repetition causes the neurons that are less relevant to the representation of the stimulus to stop firing when that stimulus is repeated.&lt;ref name=Wiggs&amp;Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiggs|first1=C.L|last2=Martin|first2=A|title=Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=1998|volume=8|pages=227–233|doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(98)80144-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way the representation is supported by a gradually sparser response, resulting in an adaptive reduction in metabolic requirements and increased efficiencies in information transmission through the neural hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  This could be the result of lateral inhibition within representational levels in a competitive [[Hebbian]] learning system, where strong connections get stronger and inhibit the weaker connections.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  Much of the evidence for this comes from primate studies of the [[inferotemporal cortex]]&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=D.J|last2=Riesenhuber|first2=M|last3=Poggio|first3=T|last4=Miller|first4=E.K|title=Experience-dependent sharpening of visual shape selectivity in inferior temporal cortex|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2006|volume=16|issue=11|pages=1631–1644|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhj100|pmid=16400159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and single cell recordings with long training periods.&lt;ref name=Sigala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigala|first1=N|last2=Logothetis|first2=N.K|title=Visual categorization shapes feature selectivity in the primate temporal cortex|journal=Nature|date=2002|volume=415|issue=6869|pages=318–320|doi=10.1038/415318a|pmid=11797008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, decreases in firing rate over short-term training on repeated stimuli appear to be greatest in those cells that initially respond with the highest activation rate,&lt;ref name="Li miller desimone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=L|last2=Miller|first2=E.K|last3=Desimone|first3=R|title=The representation of stimulus familiarity in anterior inferior temporal cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1993|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1918–1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the fatigue model above.

===''Facilitation''===
The key concept in this model is that information travels faster through the network when the current stimulus representation overlaps with a previous representation, driven by more rapid onset of neural activation with repeated presentations.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=T.W|last2=Gauthier|first2=I|title=Repetition‐induced changes in BOLD response reflect accumulation of neural activity|journal=Human Brain Mapping|date=2006|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–46|doi=10.1002/hbm.20165|pmid=15954142}}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI studies have been used in an attempt to measure these potential latency differences but the temporal resolution is not very precise&lt;ref name="Gagnepain 2008" /&gt; and single cell recordings typically do not show shortened latencies to repeated stimuli.&lt;ref name=Pedreira&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedreira|first1=C|last2=Mormann|first2=F|last3=Kraskov|first3=A|last4=Cerf|first4=M|last5=Fried|first5=I|last6=Koch|first6=C|last7=Quiroga|first7=R.Q|title=Responses of human medial temporal lobe neurons are modulated by stimulus repetition|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2010|volume=103|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1152/jn.91323.2008|pmid=19864436|pmc=2807242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possible explanation of facilitation is synaptic potentiation within an [[attractor network|attractor neural network]] model where repetition decreases the settling time as the attractor basin deepens and so increases the overall speed of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=S|last2=Moscovitch|first2=M|last3=Behrmann|first3=M|last4=Joordens|first4=S|title=Long-term semantic priming: a computational account and empirical evidence|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1059–1082|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.5.1059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Reduced prediction error/stimulus expectation''===
When a stimulus is repeated top-down feedback modulates the neural response of earlier processing regions,&lt;ref name="Friston 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friston|first1=K|title=A theory of cortical responses|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2005|volume=360|issue=1456|pages=815–836|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1622|pmid=15937014|pmc=1569488}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reduced neural activation and improved behavioural responses reflecting fulfilled expectations.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  The idea for this comes from [[predictive coding]] theories and Bayesian statistics&lt;ref name="Rao &amp; Ballard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rao|first1=R.P|last2=Ballard|first2=D.H|title=Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=1999|volume=2|issue=1|pages=79–87|doi=10.1038/4580|pmid=10195184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has some support in fMRI studies manipulating stimulus expectation.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  However, the results may also reflect the involvement of attention, which seems to have a modulatory effect on the extent of priming elicited.&lt;ref name=Larsson /&gt;

===''Neural synchrony''===
This theory is based on the idea that because downstream neurons are sensitive to both the firing rates and the timing of those inputs, efficiencies in processing may be gained through synchronised activation.&lt;ref name="Gilbert Gotts Carver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=J.R|last2=Gotts|first2=S.J|last3=Carver|first3=F.W|last4=Martin|first4=A|title=Object repetition leads to local increases in the temporal coordination of neural responses|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of synchronisation associated with repeated stimuli include phase locking found between two regions of the cat visual cortex while measuring spike synchronisation for trained compared with novel stimuli&lt;ref name="von Stein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Stein|first1=A|last2=Chiang|first2=C|last3=Konig|first3=P|title=Top-down processing mediated by interareal synchronization|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2000|volume=97|pages=14748–14753|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.26.14748|pmid=11121074|pmc=18990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suppressed firing and increased synchrony of spikes with repetition of odour puffs to locust's antennae.&lt;ref name=Stopfer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stopfer|first1=M|last2=Laurent|first2=G|title=Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics|journal=Nature|date=1000|volume=402|pages=664–668|doi=10.1038/45244|pmid=10604472}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] suggests that stimulus repetition in humans results in increased synchrony between distinct cortical regions, often the same regions that show reduced local neural activity (see repetition suppression below).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghuman|first=Avniel S.|last2=Bar|first2=Moshe|last3=Dobbins|first3=Ian G.|last4=Schnyer|first4=David M.|date=2008-06-17|title=The effects of priming on frontal-temporal communication|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=105|issue=24|pages=8405–8409|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710674105|issn=1091-6490|pmc=2448849|pmid=18541919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gotts Chow &amp; Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gotts|first1=S.J|last2=Chow|first2=C.C|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition priming and repetition suppression: A case for enhanced efficiency through neural synchronization|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=227–237|doi=10.1080/17588928.2012.670617|pmc=3491809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the timing of this across-region synchronization predicted the amount of behavioral facilitation seen with repetition priming, suggestive of a close link between synchrony and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===''Stimulus-response binding''===
This theory suggests that repetition priming is a result of binding the initial stimulus directly to the response while bypassing the intervening layers of computation.&lt;ref name="Dobbins 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobbins|first1=I.G|title=Cortical activity reductions during repetition priming can result from rapid response learning|journal=Nature|date=2004|volume=428|pages=316–319|doi=10.1038/nature02400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanism mediating this direct binding has not been clarified but several hypotheses have been put forward.  One theory explains it as a race between automatic activation of a previous stimulus-response route and the reengagement of the "algorithmic" route&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=G.D|title=Repetition priming and automaticity: Common underlying mechanisms?|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(90)90002-l}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another theory suggests the operation of an "action-trigger" where repeated stimuli trigger the previous response through perceptual or conceptual associations with the original stimulus.&lt;ref name=Kunde&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunde|first1=W|title=Conscious control over the content of unconscious cognition|journal=Cognition|date=2003|volume=88|pages=223–242|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of this theory is evidence of a response congruency effect, which would be expected from these stimulus-response bindings.&lt;ref name="Henson 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Eckstein|first2=D|last3=Waszak|first3=F|last4=Frings|first4=C|last5=Horner|first5=A.J|title=Stimulus–response bindings in priming|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2014|volume=18|issue=7|pages=376–384|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased synchrony between regions discussed above could be a neural correlate of stimulus-response binding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Neural correlates ==

=== Repetition suppression ===
The phenomenon of ''repetition suppression'', a reduction in neural activity when stimuli are repeated, is thought to depend on processing overlaps between repeated items&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=R.A|last2=Parker|first2=W.E|last3=Feiler|first3=A.M|title=Two kinds of fMRI repetition suppression?

As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001" /&gt;  In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the processing level at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features.&lt;ref name=Kristjansson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristjánsson|first1=Á|last2=Campana|first2=G|title=Where perception meets memory: A review of repetition priming in visual search tasks|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date=2010|volume=72|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.3758/app.72.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, care must be taken in interpreting the results of these studies as the relationship between repetition suppression and repetition priming has not been definitively established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=D.B|last2=Olson|first2=C.R|title=Repetition suppression in monkey inferotemporal cortex: relation to behavioral priming|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2007|volume=97|issue=5|pages=3532–3543|doi=10.1152/jn.01042.2006|pmid=17344370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repetition enhancement ===
Although repetition priming is most often associated with neural attenuation for repeated presentation of stimuli, increases in neural responses have also been measured in a number of experimental contexts.  For example, when performing mathematical calculations,&lt;ref name=Salimpoor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salimpoor|first1=V.N|last2=Chang|first2=C|last3=Menon|first3=V|title=Neural basis of repetition priming during mathematical cognition: repetition suppression or repetition enhancement?|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=790–805|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21234|pmc=4366146}}&lt;/ref&gt; when repeated stimuli are degraded,&lt;ref name="Horner &amp; Henson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=A.J|last2=Henson|first2=R.N|title=Priming, response learning and repetition suppression|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2008|volume=46|issue=7|pages=1979–1991|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in studies involving a backward masking paradigm&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006" /&gt; and when stimuli have no pre-existing associations or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Shallice|first2=T|last3=Dolan|first3=R|title=Neuroimaging evidence for dissociable forms of repetition priming|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=287|issue=5456|pages=1269–1272|doi=10.1126/science.287.5456.1269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reproducibility''' is the closeness of the agreement between the results of [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal). Reproducibilty can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] to check, that the results are not an artefact of the measurment procedures.&lt;ref name=GUM&gt;{{Citation

The values obtained from distinct experimental trials are said to be ''commensurate'' if they are obtained according to the same reproducible experimental description and procedure. The basic idea can be seen in [[Aristotle]]'s dictum that there is no scientific knowledge of the [[singleton (mathematics)|individual]], where the word used for ''individual'' in Greek had the connotation of the ''idiosyncratic'', or wholly isolated occurrence. Thus all knowledge, all science, necessarily involves the formation of general concepts and the invocation of their corresponding symbols in language (cf. Turner). Aristotle′s conception about the knowledge of the individual being considered unscientific is due to lack of the field of [[statistics]] in his time, so he could not appeal to statistical averaging by the individual.

A particular experimentally obtained value is said to be reproducible if there is a high degree of agreement between [[measurements]] or observations conducted on [[Replication (statistics)|replicate]] specimens in different locations by different people—that is, if the experimental value is found to have a high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/E177.htm|title = Standard Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods|year = 2014|author = Subcommittee E11.20 on Test Method Evaluation and Quality Control|publisher = ASTM International|id = ASTM E177}}{{Paywall}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in science, a very well reproduced result is one that can be confirmed using as many ''different'' experimental setups as possible and as many lines of evidence as possible ([[consilience]]).

==History==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump was, in terms of the 17th Century, a complicated and expensive scientific apparatus, making reproducibility of results difficult]]
The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]], in England in the 17th century. Boyle's [[air pump]] was designed to generate and study [[vacuum]], which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. [[History of science|Historians of science]] e.g. [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], in their 1985 book ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the [[experimental method]], maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.

The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] built his own air pump in [[Amsterdam]], the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time [[Robert Hooke]]. Huygens reported an effect he termed "anomalous suspension", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, “it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump”. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that “the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]] noted briefly in his famous 1934 book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' that “non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science”.&lt;ref&gt;This citation is from the 1959 translation to English, [[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistics|Statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote in his 1935 book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of [[hypothesis testing]] and [[statistical significance]], that “we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]], ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', (1971) [1935](9th ed.), Macmillan, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assertions express a common [[dogma]] in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.

==Reproducible data==

Reproducibility is one component of the precision of a measurement or test method.  The other component is [[repeatability]] which is the degree of agreement of tests or measurements on replicate specimens by the same observer in the same laboratory.  Both repeatability and reproducibility are usually reported as a [[standard deviation]].  A reproducibility limit is the value below which the difference between two test results obtained under reproducibility conditions may be expected to occur with a probability of approximately 0.95 (95%).&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"/&gt;

Reproducibility is determined from controlled interlaboratory test programs or a [[measurement systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E691  Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM F1469  Standard Guide for Conducting a Repeatability and Reproducibility Study on Test Equipment for Nondestructive Testing&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are often confused, there is an important distinction between replicates and an independent repetition of an experiment. Replicates are performed within an experiment. They are not and cannot provide independent evidence of reproducibility. Rather they serve as an internal "check" on an experiment and should not be shown as part of the experimental results within a scientific publication. It is the independent repetition of an experiment that serves to underpin its reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaux | first1 = D.

Psychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results. Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J.

Fewer than half of the attempted replications were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, which began with the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the [[EQUATOR Network]]. This group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Waste/EQUATOR Conference {{!}} Research Waste|url = http://researchwaste.net/research-wasteequator-conference/|website = researchwaste.net|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially biomedical research.

Reproducible research is key to new discoveries in [[pharmacology]]. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = F. | last2 = Schlange | first2 = T. | last3 = Asadullah | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1038/nrd3439-c1 | title = Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets? | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 712 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21892149| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study by Begley and Ellis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that reviewed a decade of research. That study found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were irreproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Begley | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = L.

A. Ioannidis]] writes, "While currently there is unilateral emphasis on 'first' discoveries, there should be as much emphasis on replication of discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3342867/Is-the-spirit-of-Piltdown-man-alive-and-well.html Is the spirit of Piltdown man alive and well?]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nature'' study was itself reproduced in the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]'', which confirmed that a majority of cancer researchers surveyed had been unable to reproduce a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mobley | first1 = A. | last2 = Linder | first2 = S.

In 2016, ''Nature'' conducted a survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. According to the survey, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. "Although 52% of those surveyed agree there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think failure to reproduce published results means the result is probably wrong, and most say they still trust the published literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Monya | year = | title =  1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 533 | issue = | pages = 452–454 | doi = 10.1038/533452a | bibcode = 2016Natur.533..452B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy irreproducible results==
[[Hideyo Noguchi]] became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of [[syphilis]], but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.{{citation needed|reason=Needs to be verifiable, otherwise it is anecdotal. Wild claims need citations. |date=August 2015}}

In March 1989, [[University of Utah]] chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process ("[[cold fusion]]"). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an [[electrolysis]] cell containing [[heavy water]] and a [[palladium]] [[cathode]] which rapidly absorbed the [[deuterium]] produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see [[science by press conference]]). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physicists Debunk Claim Of a New Kind of Fusion|newspaper=New York Times|last=Browne|first=Malcolm|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/050399sci-cold-fusion.html|date=3 May 1989|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over {{convert|25|mi|km}} away [[Wireless energy transfer|without using wires]]. In 1904 he built [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] on [[Shoreham, New York|Long Island]] to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret (1999), ''Tesla Master of Lightning'', New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books,  {{ISBN|0-7607-1005-8}}, pp. 107.; "Unable to overcome his financial burdens, he was forced to close the laboratory in 1905."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:
* [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency]], revealed to be the result of fraud
* [[GFAJ-1]], a bacterium that could purportedly incorporate [[arsenic biochemistry|arsenic]] into its DNA in place of phosphorus
* [[MMR vaccine controversy]] – a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' claiming the MMR vaccine caused autism was revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Schön scandal]] – semiconductor "breakthroughs" revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Power posing]] – a [[social psychology]] phenomenon that went viral after being the subject of a very popular [[TED talk]], but was unable to be replicated in dozens of studies&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stochastic processes==
The reproducibility requirement cannot be applied to individual samples of phenomena which have a partially or totally non-deterministic nature.  However, it still applies to the probabilistic description of such phenomena, with error tolerance given by probability theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12413">'''Shade avoidance''' is a set of responses that plants display when they are subjected to the [[shade (shadow)|shade]] of another plant. It often includes [[etiolation|elongation]], altered [[flowering]] time, increased [[apical dominance]] and altered partitioning of resources. This set of responses is collectively called the '''shade-avoidance syndrome''' (SAS).

Shade responses display varying strength along a continuum. Most plants are neither extreme shade avoiders or [[Shade tolerance|tolerators]], but possess a combination of the two strategies; this helps adapt them to their environment. However, the ability to perceive and respond to shade plays a very important role in all plants: they are [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] by nature and access to [[photosynthetically active radiation]] is essential for plant nutrition and growth.

Over the past few decades, major increases in grain yield have come largely through increasing planting densities.  As planting densities increase so does the proportion of far red light in the canopy.  Thus, it is likely that plant breeders have selected for lines with reduced SAS in their efforts to produce high yields at high density.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Sensing shade ==
Plants can tell the difference between the shade of an inanimate object (e.g. a rock) and the shade of another plant, as well as the presence of nearby plants that may compete with and shade it in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roig-Villanova|first1=Irma|last2=Martínez-García|first2=Jaime F.|title=Plant Responses to Vegetation Proximity: A Whole Life Avoiding Shade|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=29 February 2016|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00236|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the shade of a plant, [[far red light]] is present in a higher [[irradiance]] than red light, as a result of the absorption of the red light by the pigments involved in [[photosynthesis]], while a nearby plant forms an intermediate ratio. This is known as far red enrichment. [[Phytochrome]] can be used to measure the ratio of far red to red light, and thus to detect whether the plant is in the shade of another plant, so it can alter its growth strategy accordingly ([[photomorphogenesis]]).  In Arabidopsis, phytochrome B is the predominant photoreceptor that regulates SAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = H. | last2 = Whitelam | first2 = G. C. | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-104.x | title = The shade avoidance syndrome: Multiple responses mediated by multiple phytochromes | journal = Plant, Cell and Environment | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 840–844 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytochromes exist in two forms: P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;FR&lt;/sub&gt;. It is synthesised as P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, but red light triggers a [[conformational change]], producing P&lt;sub&gt;FR&lt;/sub&gt;. Far red light causes the phytochrome to be converted back into P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. For a given red:far red light ratio, there will be a [[dynamic equilibrium]] in the relative quantities of P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;FR&lt;/sub&gt; present. Far red enrichment causes a build-up of P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. If P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is present above a species-specific threshold, shade avoidance [[Signal transduction|signal transduction pathways]] will be activated.

== Seedling response ==
Seedling response is the most well understood factor of shade avoidance. In the model organism ''Arabidopsis thaliana'', the shade avoidance response varies at different points in the life cycle. Dry, dormant seeds will not germinate if they are in the shade. Once dormancy has been broken and they have imbibed water, the seeds are committed to germination. Water-imbibed seeds display [[hypocotyl]] elongation; if the shade were caused by excessive soil depth, this would help the seedling grow vertically very quickly and push up and out of the ground. If an ''Arabidopsis'' seedling becomes shaded, its [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]] and [[Plant stem|internodes]] elongate. It may even lose [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Casal | doi = 10.1199/tab.0157 | title = Shade Avoidance | journal = The Arabidopsis Book | year = 2011 | pmid =  22582029| pmc = 3350169| volume=10 | pages=e0157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathway ===
Studies using ''Brassica rapa'' indicate that the light quality and ratio available to seedlings is sensed in the cotyledons, which upregulates the production of [[auxin]]. ''Arabidopsis'' was used to demonstrate PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) involvement in auxin production. PIFs are transcription factors that regulate thousands of genes related to germination repression and shade avoidance, and PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 directly regulate genes that code for the enzymes required in auxin synthesis. Other PIF proteins are thought to be involved in regulating auxin and the plant's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leivar|first1=P|last2=Quail|first2=PH|title=PIFs: pivotal components in a cellular signaling hub.|journal=Trends in Plant Science|date=January 2011|volume=16|issue=1|pages=19–28|pmid=20833098|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.08.003|pmc=3019249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shade conditions, P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; induces the [[dephosphorylation]] of PIF proteins, which strengthens their ability to bind DNA and promote transcription of genes involved in shade avoidance response, including in the production of auxin and its receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roig-Villanova|first1=Irma|last2=Martínez-García|first2=Jaime F.|title=Plant Responses to Vegetation Proximity: A Whole Life Avoiding Shade|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=29 February 2016|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00236|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxin is transported to the hypocotyl to promote elongation, although the mechanism it uses to do so remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Procko|first1=C|last2=Crenshaw|first2=CM|last3=Ljung|first3=K|last4=Noel|first4=JP|last5=Chory|first5=J|title=Cotyledon-Generated Auxin Is Required for Shade-Induced Hypocotyl Growth in Brassica rapa.|journal=|date=2 June 2014|volume=165|issue=3|pages=1285–1301|pmid=24891610|doi=10.1104/pp.114.241844|pmc=4081337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adult response ==
Shade avoidance response in adult plants is less commonly studied than it is in seedlings, though adult ''Arabidopsis'' show more complex response patterns than seedlings. Shaded adults have elongated [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] at the [[rosette (botany)|rosette]], smaller leaf blades, and suppressed [[axillary bud]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=González-Grandío|first1=E|last2=Poza-Carrión|first2=C|last3=Sorzano|first3=CO|last4=Cubas|first4=P|title=BRANCHED1 promotes axillary bud dormancy in response to shade in Arabidopsis.|journal=The Plant Cell|date=March 2013|volume=25|issue=3|pages=834–50|pmid=23524661|doi=10.1105/tpc.112.108480|pmc=3634692}}&lt;/ref&gt; By elongating the petiole sideways, the plant repositions its leaves away from shading plants to absorb more red light, though there is a trade off in leaf size. The leaves can also bend upwards towards potential light sources as a result of higher growth on the underside of the petiole than the top, a process called hyponasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=JJ|title=Shade avoidance.|journal=The Arabidopsis book / American Society of Plant Biologists|date=2012|volume=10|pages=e0157|pmid=22582029|doi=10.1199/tab.0157|pmc=3350169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flattening of leaves in plants with normally curled leaves also increases surface area for light absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozuka|first1=T|last2=Suetsugu|first2=N|last3=Wada|first3=M|last4=Nagatani|first4=A|title=Antagonistic regulation of leaf flattening by phytochrome B and phototropin in Arabidopsis thaliana.|journal=Plant &amp; cell physiology|date=January 2013|volume=54|issue=1|pages=69–79|pmid=23054390|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcs134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a mature plant becomes shaded, shade avoidance also often prompts changes in reproductive strategies. Plants may flower early, as it is unlikely that growing more structures will result in profitable nutrient gain in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Casal | doi = 10.1199/tab.0157 | title = Shade Avoidance | journal = The Arabidopsis Book | year = 2011 | pmid =  22582029| pmc = 3350169| volume=10 | pages=e0157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Arabidopsis'', early flowering is linked to overall lower [[reproductive success]] due to lower seed production, smaller fruit, and lower germination rate of seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franklin|first1=KA|last2=Praekelt|first2=U|last3=Stoddart|first3=WM|last4=Billingham|first4=OE|last5=Halliday|first5=KJ|last6=Whitelam|first6=GC|title=Phytochromes B, D, and E act redundantly to control multiple physiological responses in Arabidopsis.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=March 2003|volume=131|issue=3|pages=1340–6|pmid=12644683|doi=10.1104/pp.102.015487|pmc=166893}}&lt;/ref&gt; although germination success is also dependent on [[genetic variation]] between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=SM|last2=Farrugia|first2=G|last3=Schmalz|first3=PF|last4=Ermilov|first4=LG|last5=Maines|first5=MD|last6=Szurszewski|first6=JH|title=Heme oxygenase 2 is present in interstitial cell networks of the mouse small intestine.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=February 1998|volume=114|issue=2|pages=239–44|pmid=9453482|doi=10.1016/s0016-5085(98)70473-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathway ===
Like seedlings, adult plant shade avoidance involves several mechanisms acting together. Petiole elongation is both a result of cell expansion and cell division, though not at the same stage in petiole and leaf formation. In newly growing leaves, cell division is the primary factor, while fully formed leaves and petioles rely on cell expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roig-Villanova|first1=Irma|last2=Martínez-García|first2=Jaime F.|title=Plant Responses to Vegetation Proximity: A Whole Life Avoiding Shade|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=29 February 2016|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00236|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family of cell wall modifying proteins. In shade conditions, the genes coding for XTH9, XTH15/XTR7, XTH16, XTH17, and XTH19 are up-regulated and these proteins act to hydrolyze and weaken the cell wall, allowing for expansion of the petiole cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sasidharan|first1=R|last2=Chinnappa|first2=CC|last3=Staal|first3=M|last4=Elzenga|first4=JT|last5=Yokoyama|first5=R|last6=Nishitani|first6=K|last7=Voesenek|first7=LA|last8=Pierik|first8=R|title=Light quality-mediated petiole elongation in Arabidopsis during shade avoidance involves cell wall modification by xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases.|journal=Plant Physiology|date=October 2010|volume=154|issue=2|pages=978–90|pmid=20688978|doi=10.1104/pp.110.162057|pmc=2949003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like in seedlings, PIF7 is involved in the regulation of petiole and leaf growth due to low R:FR, by up-regulating auxin-related and [[brassinosteroid]]-response genes which promote growth. Auxin signalling is also essential to  hyponasty, though its role is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=JJ|title=Shade avoidance.|journal=The Arabidopsis book / American Society of Plant Biologists|date=2012|volume=10|pages=e0157|pmid=22582029|doi=10.1199/tab.0157|pmc=3350169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leaf curling is primarily a response to phytochrome B converting to P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in shade conditions, which promotes unequal proliferation and growth of cells on the upper and lower leaf sides. Two [[gene redundancy|redundant]] genes, ''ATHB4'' and ''HAT3'', code for transcription factors that regulate leaf curling, with [[loss of function]] mutants having plants with leaves that curl downwards, and plants with over-expressive copies of these genes having leaves that curl strongly upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bou-Torrent|first1=J|last2=Salla-Martret|first2=M|last3=Brandt|first3=R|last4=Musielak|first4=T|last5=Palauqui|first5=JC|last6=Martínez-García|first6=JF|last7=Wenkel|first7=S|title=ATHB4 and HAT3, two class II HD-ZIP transcription factors, control leaf development in Arabidopsis.|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|date=November 2012|volume=7|issue=11|pages=1382–7|pmid=22918502|doi=10.4161/psb.21824|pmc=3548853}}&lt;/ref&gt; By changing expression of these genes, plants can straighten their leaves in response to shade.

The '''Tagish Lake''' meteorite fell at 16:43 UTC on 18 January 2000 in the [[Tagish Lake]] area in northwestern [[British Columbia]], Canada.

==History==
Fragments of the Tagish Lake&lt;ref name=database/&gt; [[meteorite]] landed upon the [[Earth]] on January 18, 2000 at 16:43 UT (08:43 local time in Yukon) after a large meteoroid exploded in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of {{convert|50|-|30|km}} with an estimated total energy release of about 1.7 [[Ton#Unit of energy|kiloton]]s. Following the reported sighting of a [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] in southern [[Yukon]] and northern British Columbia, Canada, more than 500 fragments of the meteorite were collected from the lake's frozen surface. Post-event atmospheric photographs of the trail left by the associated fireball and U.S. Department of Defense satellite information yielded the meteor trajectory.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last=Brown |first=Peter G. |author2=Alan R.

The passage of the fireball and the high-altitude explosion set off a wide array of [[satellite]] sensors as well as [[seismograph]]s.

The local inhabitants described the smell in the air following the airburst as [[sulfurous]] and many first thought the blast was caused by a missile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/60837/697839233.pdf |title=Morning Light - The Secret History of the Tagish Lake Fireball by MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE James Scott Berdahl B.S.Geology Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404034708/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/60837/697839233.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteoroid==
The Tagish Lake meteoroid is estimated to have been 4 meters in diameter and 56 [[tonne]]s in weight before it entered the Earth's atmosphere. However, it is estimated that only 1.3 tonnes remained after [[ablation]] in the upper atmosphere and several fragmentation events, meaning that around 97% of the meteorite had vaporised, mainly becoming stratospheric dust that was seen as [[noctilucent clouds]] to the northwest of [[Edmonton]] at sunset, some 12 hours after the event. Of the 1.3 tonnes of fragmented rock, somewhat over {{convert|10|kg}} (about 1%) was found and collected.

==Specimens==
Tagish Lake is classified as a [[carbonaceous chondrite]], type C2 ungrouped. The pieces of the Tagish Lake meteorite are dark grey to almost black in color with small light-colored inclusions, and a maximum size of ~2.3&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  Except for a greyish fusion crust, the meteorites have the visual appearance of a charcoal [[briquette]].&lt;ref&gt;Geological Survey of Canada. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080627021649/http://cgc.rncan.gc.ca/meteor/images/tlm1.jpg Meteorite fragment photo]&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments were transported in their frozen state to research facilities after they were collected by a local resident in late January, 2000. Initial studies of these fresh fragments were done in collaboration with researchers from [[NASA]]. Snowfall covered the remaining fragments until April 2000, when a search effort was mounted by researchers from the [[University of Calgary]] and [[University of Western Ontario]]. These later fragments were mostly found to have sunk into the ice by a few cm to more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm, and had to be collected out of meltwater holes, or cut in icy blocks from the frozen surface of Tagish Lake.

Fragments of the fresh, "pristine" Tagish Lake meteorite totaling more than 850 g are currently held in the collections at the Royal Ontario Museum and the [[University of Alberta]]. "Degraded" fragments from the April–May 2000 search are curated mainly at the [[University of Calgary]] and the [[University of Western Ontario]].

==Analysis and classification==
Analyses have shown that Tagish Lake fragments are of a primitive type, containing unchanged [[cosmic dust|stellar dust]] granules that may have been part of the cloud of material that created our [[solar system]] and [[Sun]]. This meteorite shows some similarities to the two most primitive carbonaceous chondrite types, the CI and CM chondrites; it is nevertheless quite distinct from either of them. Tagish Lake has a much lower density than any other type of chondrite and is actually composed of two somewhat different rock types. The major difference between the two lithologies is in the abundance of carbonate minerals; one is poor in carbonates and the other is rich in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mittlefehldt |first=D.

The meteorite contains an abundance of [[organic material]]s, including [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/features/2011/tagish-lake.html Asteroid Served Up "Custom Orders" of Life's Ingredients], June 9, 2011 (accessed 23 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  The organics in the meteorite may have originally formed in the interstellar medium and/or the solar protoplanetary disk, but were subsequently modified in the meteorites' asteroidal parent bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Origin and Evolution of Prebiotic Organic Matter As Inferred from the Tagish Lake Meteorite | journal = Science | date = 10 June 2011 | author = Christopher D.

A portion of the carbon in the Tagish Lake meteorite is contained in what are called [[nanodiamond]]s—very tiny diamond grains at most only a few micrometers in size. In fact, Tagish Lake contains more of the nanodiamonds than any other meteorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grady |first=Monica M. |display-authors=etal |date=2002 |title=Light element geochemistry of the Tagish Lake CI2 chondrite: comparison with CI1 and CM2 meteorites |journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science |volume=37 |issue= 5|pages=713–735 |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00851.x|bibcode = 2002M&amp;PS...37..713G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the meteorite is estimated to be about 4.55 billion years thus being a remainder of the period when the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|solar system was formed]].

==Origin==
Based on eyewitness accounts of the [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] caused by the incoming meteorite and on the calibrated photographs of the track which it had left behind and which was visible for about half an hour, scientists have managed to calculate the orbit it followed before it impacted with Earth. Although none of the photographs captured the fireball directly, the fireball path was reconstructed from two calibrated photos taken minutes after the event, giving the entry angle. Eyewitness accounts in the vicinity of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Yukon]] accurately constrained the [[ground track]] azimuth from either side. It was found that the Tagish Lake meteorite had a pre-entry Apollo type [[orbit]] that brought it from the outer reaches of the [[asteroid belt]]. Currently, there are only eleven meteorite falls with accurately determined pre-entry orbits, based on photographs or video recordings of the fireballs themselves taken from two or more different angles.

Further study of the reflectance spectrum of the meteorite indicate that it most likely originated from [[773 Irmintraud]], a D-type asteroid.

==Comparisons==
The double, and not the expected single, plume formation of debris, as seen in video and photographs of the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] dust trail and believed by Peter Brown to have coincided near the primary airburst location, was also pictured following the Tagish Lake fireball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reentry.arc.nasa.gov/scienceastro.html |title=Hypervelocity reentries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Brown, likely indicates where rising air quickly flowed into the center of the trail, essentially in the same manner as a moving 3D version of a [[mushroom cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meteor.uwo.ca/publications/wgn-chel.pdf.pdf |title=WGN, the Journal of the IMO 41:1 (2013) A Preliminary Report on the Chelyabinsk Fireball/Airburst Peter Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ghost Shirt''' is believed to have been worn by a [[Sioux]] warrior killed in the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. The shirt is plain cotton, has raven, owl, and eagle feathers hanging from the neck, and is pierced in several places with bullet holes. There are slight brown stains of blood, but it cannot be confirmed that the shirt originated from the massacre. [[Ghost Dance]] shirts are said to be objects of power to the wearer, and sacred to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. The Lakota Sioux were the only tribe to believe that the ghost shirt clothing would protect them from the bullets of the white man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/title/Ghost%2520Shirt Everything 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 the shirt was brought to [[Glasgow]], and sold to [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum|Kelvingrove Museum]] by George C. Crager, a member of [[Buffalo Bill]] Cody's [[Wild West Traveling Show]]. The shirt was displayed at the museum from 1892 until 1999.

A four-year campaign led by Marcella Le Beau, secretary of The Wounded Knee Association and great-granddaughter of one of the survivors of Wounded Knee, sought the shirt's return to the [[Lakota people]]. In November 1998 [[Glasgow City Council]] voted to return it after the city residents supported the move. In a gesture of good will, the Ghost Dance Shirt was replaced by another made in 1998 by Marcella Le Beau herself. She said, "This will bring about a sense of closure to a sad and horrible event. Now healing can begin." The Lakota leaders said that the shirt will be displayed at one of the Reservations once a new museum is built.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/371/0051808.htm Memo from Glasgow City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/217816.stm BBC News Nov 30, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/409876.stm BBC News Aug 2, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sioux-to-be-given-ghost-shirt-1186048.html The Independent Nov 20, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluecloud.org/ghostshirt.html from [[South Dakota Magazine]] Sept.1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200804/http://www.bluecloud.org/ghostshirt.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4466945.html Chicago Sun-Times Nov 18, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tibet House NYC.jpg|thumb|right|The Tibet House in New York City]]
'''Tibet House US Cultural Center of H. H. the Dalai Lama''' was founded in 1987 by [[Columbia University]] professor [[Robert Thurman]], actor [[Richard Gere]] and modern composer [[Philip Glass]] (among others) at the behest of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Anonymous report |title=Richard Gere And Dalai Lama Announce Center for Tibetan Culture |url=https://www.apnews.com/a8517d5efbd119474f3db9bd4786b029 |website=AP News |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=13 July 2018 |date=28 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially organized in New York City, USA, and the Tibet House US is still based there. Their current address is 22 West 15th Street, New York, NY 10011, on the 2nd floor.

[[File:Tibet House Building, Delhi, India.jpg|thumb|right|Tibet House Building in Lodhi Road, New Delhi, India]]
