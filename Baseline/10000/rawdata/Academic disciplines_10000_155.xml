      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">{{Other uses|Act (disambiguation)}}

An '''act''' is a division or unit of a [[theatre]] work, including a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[opera]], and [[musical theatre]]. The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Life of Plays|last=Waters|first=Steve|publisher=Nick Hern Books|year=2010|isbn=978 1 84842 000 7|location=London|pages=32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. The former use of the term may or may not align with the latter. The word ''act'' can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as [[variety show]]s, [[television]] programs, [[music hall]] performances, and [[cabaret]].

==Acts and scenes==
An '''act''' is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax and resolution.:&gt;&gt; A [[scene (drama)|scene]] is a part of an act defined with the changing of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130409233719/http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-09 |title=Plays, Acts and Scenes in Structure |last=Sherlock |first=Karl |publisher=Grossmont College |date=2005 |work=English 160: Drama Writing |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more specific, the elements that create the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play or any story, and divide a play into acts include the exposition, which give information, setting up the rest of the story. Another is the inciting incident, which starts all of the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed; this holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications. These are the things that change the action. These complications lead up to the crisis, this is the turning point. Most of the time, at this point, the major dramatic question has been answered. Finally, there is the resolution. This is the end of the play where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved. This leaves the audience satisfied with the play as a whole. These more specific elements of plot in a play are the main things used to divide a play up into acts and sometimes scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Novic, J. (2012). Drama. In World book advanced. Retrieved from http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was the first to divide [[Play (theatre)|plays]] into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into [[scene (drama)|scenes]]; in classical theater each regrouping between entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Though there are no limits to the number of acts which might exist within a dramatic work, the most common formats are the three-act and five-act structures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Both of these are derived from different interpretations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and "an orderly arrangement of parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Poetics by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer; and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place; but the division between acts is more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision, else having an important decision to make. A decision which has a profound impact on the story being told.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a [[three-act structure]]. Many [[operettas]] and most [[musical theatre|musicals]] are divided into just two acts, so in practice the [[intermission]] is seen as dividing them, and the word "act" comes to be used for the two halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.

==Varieties==

=== One-act plays ===

A [[one-act play]] is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Three-act plays ===
{{See also|Three-act structure}}

In a three-act play, each act usually has a different tone to it. The most commonly used structure is the first act having a lot of introductory elements, the second act can usually be the darkest with the antagonists having a greater encompass, while the third act is the resolution and the protagonists prevailing. There is an age-old saying that "the second act is the best" because it was in between a starting and ending act and thus being able to delve deeper into more of the meat of the story since it does not need to have as prominent introductory or resolutive portions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is not always so, since a third act or even a first act can have the common second act characteristics, but that type of structure is the most used.
* Act one: In Act I the conflict of the story is discovered. In this act, the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], the introduction of the [[protagonist]], and other characters that the protagonist meets take place,&lt;ref name="Cannell"&gt;Cannell, S. J. (n.d.). What is the three act structure? [Lecture transcript].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Premise (film)|dramatic premise]] and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act.
* Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point and seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective and it seems like there is no longer any way that the protagonist can succeed.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;
* Act three: The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] occurs as well as the [[dénouement]], a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns. It is simply the resolution.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;

=== Five-act plays ===
Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of [[William Shakespeare]], for example, generally adheres to a five act structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare and Five Acts: studies in a dramatic convention|last=Snuggs|first=Henry L.|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . This format is known as the [[Dramatic structure|five-act play]], and was famously analyzed by [[Gustav Freytag]] in ''Die Technik des Dramas'' (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play; but in performance there was not necessarily any clear separation between them.

A similar five-part structure is also used in traditional Japanese [[Noh]] drama, particularly by [[Zeami Motokiyo]]. Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Shelley Fenno|date=Spring 1993|title=How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''|journal=[[Monumenta Nipponica]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=58–62|jstor=2385466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
As part of a [[television program]], each individual act can be separated by commercials.
In [[film]], a number of scenes grouped together bring to an audiovisual work to life. The three act structure is commonly referred to in [[film adaptation]] of theatrical plays.

{{About|the act of adultery or extramarital sex|other uses|Adultery (disambiguation)|a broad overview|Religion and sexuality}}
{{Sex and the law}}
{{Family law}}
'''Adultery''' (from [[Latin]] ''adulterium'') is [[extramarital sex]] that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although what [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, "Adultery" |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an [[affair]].

Historically, many cultures have considered adultery to be a very serious [[crime]]. Adultery often incurred severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including [[capital punishment]], [[mutilation]], or [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=mt0TAAAAIAAJ |title=The doctrine and law of marriage, adultery, and divorce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in [[Western countries]] from the 19th century. In most Western countries, adultery itself is no longer a criminal offense, but may still have legal consequences, particularly in [[divorce]] cases. For example, in fault-based [[family law]] jurisdictions, adultery almost always constitutes a [[grounds for divorce|ground for divorce]] and may be a factor in [[property settlement]], the [[child custody|custody]] of children, the denial of [[alimony]], etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a [[no-fault divorce]] model. In some societies and among certain religious adherents, adultery may affect the [[social status]] of those involved, and may result in social [[ostracize|ostracism]].

In countries where adultery is a criminal offense, punishments range from [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s to [[caning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/aceh-woman-gangraped-by-vigilantes-for-alleged-adultery-now-to-be-flogged-20140507-zr5x3.html|title=Aceh woman, gang-raped by vigilantes for alleged adultery, now to be flogged|work=The Age|date=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial, with international organizations calling for their abolition, especially in the light of several high-profile [[stoning]] cases that have occurred in some countries. The head of the United Nations expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, [[Kamala Chandrakirana]], has stated that: "Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/adultery-laws-unfairly-target-women-u-n-says/ |title=IPS – Adultery Laws Unfairly Target Women, U.N. Says &amp;#124; Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: "Adultery as a criminal offence violates women’s human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp;LangID=E |title=DisplayNews |publisher=Ohchr.org |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Muslim countries that follow [[Sharia law]] for criminal justice, the punishment for adultery may be stoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/isl_adul2.htm |title=Punishment for adultery in Islam |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20130927160132-qt52c/ |title=INFOGRAPHIC: Stoning - where is it legal? |publisher=Trust.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, though in recent times it has been legally carried out only in Iran and Somalia.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mic |url=http://mic.com/articles/68431/women-around-the-world-are-being-stoned-to-death-do-you-know-the-facts |title=Women Around the World Are Being Stoned to Death. Do You Know the Facts? |publisher=Mic |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries that criminalize adultery are those where the dominant religion is Islam, and several [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n Christian-majority countries, but there are some notable exceptions to this rule, namely Philippines, Taiwan, and several U.S. states. In some jurisdictions, having sexual relations with the king's wife or the wife of his eldest son constitutes [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Treason Act 1351]] which still applies.&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, in cultures which value and normally practice exclusive [[interpersonal relationship]]s, sexual relations with a person outside the relationship may also be described as [[infidelity]] or cheating, and is subject to sanction.

The term ''adultery'' refers to sexual acts between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adultery |title=Adultery - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adultery |title=Adultery &amp;#124; Define Adultery at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adultery |title=adultery - definition of adultery in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may arise in [[criminal law]] or in [[family law]]. For instance, in the United Kingdom, adultery is not a criminal offense, but is a [[grounds for divorce|ground for divorce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/divorce/grounds-for-divorce |title=Get a divorce |publisher=gov.uk |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the legal definition of adultery being "physical contact with an alien and unlawful organ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Limits: The Role of the Law in Bioethical Decision Making |last=Dworkin |first=Roger B. |year=1996 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-33075-8 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extramarital sexual acts not fitting this definition are not "adultery" though they may constitute "unreasonable behavior", also a ground of divorce.

The application of the term to the act appears to arise from the idea that "criminal intercourse with a married woman ... tended to adulterate the issue [children] of an innocent husband ... and to expose him to support and provide for another man's [children]".&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v. Murff'', 135 F. Supp. 907, 911 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "purity" of the children of a marriage is corrupted, and the inheritance is altered.

Some adultery laws differentiate based on the sex of the participants, and as a result such laws are often seen as discriminatory, and in some jurisdictions they have been struck down by courts, usually on the basis that they discriminated against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6528869.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Ugandan adultery law 'too sexist' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

The term ''adultery'', rather than ''extramarital sex'', implies a moral condemnation of the act; as such it is usually not a neutral term because it carries an implied judgment that the act is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Blackwell Publishing &lt;!--not John Wiley &amp; Sons it seems, better?--&gt;| doi=10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee372|chapter=Adultery|title=International Encyclopedia of Ethics|year=2013|last1=Brake|first1=Elizabeth|isbn=9781405186414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery refers to sexual relations which are not officially legitimized; for example it does not refer to having sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the case of [[polygamy]] (when a man is married to more than one wife at a time, called [[polygyny]]; or when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, called [[polyandry]]).

==Definitions and legal constructs==
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Anne Boleyn]] was found guilty of adultery and treason and executed in 1536.

[[File:Jules Arsène Garnier - Le supplice des adultères.jpg|thumb|200px|''Le supplice des adultères'', by Jules Arsène Garnier, showing two adulterers being punished]]
In the traditional English [[common law]], adultery was a [[felony]]. Although the legal definition of ''adultery'' differs in nearly every legal system, the common theme is [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]] outside of marriage, in one form or another.

Traditionally, many cultures, particularly [[Latin American]] ones, had strong [[double standards]] regarding male and female adultery, with the latter being seen as a much more serious violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19690828&amp;id=zD0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7328,4648572|title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, edited by Jose C. Moya, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Tranquility and Order: Family and Community on Mexico's Northern Frontier, 1800–1850, by Laura M. Shelton, pp. 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery involving a married woman and a man other than her husband was considered a very serious crime. In 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt stated that a man having sexual relations with another man's wife was "the highest invasion of property" and claimed, in regard to the aggrieved husband, that "a man cannot receive a higher provocation" (in a case of murder or manslaughter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=0PLYXR2x0n0C }} |title=Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter |author=Samuel H. Pillsbury |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopédie|Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert]]'', Vol. 1 (1751), also equated adultery to [[theft]] writing that, "adultery is, after homicide, the most punishable of all crimes, because it is the most cruel of all thefts, and an outrage capable of inciting murders and the most deplorable excesses."&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.328 |title=Adultery |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |date=2009-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-26|last1=Denis Diderot (Biography) |first1=François-Vincent Toussaint (Biography) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal definitions of adultery vary. For example, [[New York (state)|New York]] defines an adulterer as a person who "engages in [[sexual intercourse]] with another person at a time when he has a living spouse, or the other person has a living spouse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[common-law]] countries, adultery was also known as ''[[criminal conversation]].'' This became the name of the civil [[tort]] arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as ''crim. con.'', and was abolished in [[England]] in 1857, and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1976. Another tort, [[alienation of affection]], arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957, citing ''Young v. Young'', 236 Ala. 627, 184 So. 187. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This act was also known as desertion, which was often a crime as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |title=Criminal Conversation: North Carolina Laws and Defense |publisher=Haas McNeil &amp; Associates, P.A. |accessdate=2010-07-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604043419/http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |archivedate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wayne Drash, CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/12/08/cheating.spouses.lawsuits/ |title=Beware cheaters: Your lover's spouse can sue you - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilga.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2019&amp;ChapterID=57|title=740 ILCS 5/  Alienation of Affections Abolition Act.|website=www.ilga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marriage in which both spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is sometimes referred to as an [[open marriage]] or the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] lifestyle. [[Polyamory]], meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance of intimate relationships that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or intimate relationships, with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of [[non-monogamy]], and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extra-marital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.

In Canada, though the written definition in the ''[[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]]'' refers to extramarital relations with someone of the opposite sex, a [[British Columbia]] judge used the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' in a 2005 case to grant a woman a divorce from her husband who had cheated on her with another man, which the judge felt was equal reasoning to dissolve the union.

In the United Kingdom, case law restricts the definition of adultery to penetrative sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, no matter the gender of the spouses in the marriage, although infidelity with a person of the same gender can be grounds for a divorce as unreasonable behavior; this situation was discussed at length during debates on the [[Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/lhan31.pdf |title=The Parliamentary Debates| house=House of Lords | date=8–9 July 2013 |speaker=[[Tina Stowell, Baroness Stowell of Beeston]]|volume=747|no=31|column_start=145|column_end=147 |position=Lords Spokesperson for [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Women and Equalities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, [[Adultery law in India|adultery]] is the sexual intercourse of a man with a married woman without the consent of her husband when such sexual intercourse does not amount to rape. It was a non-cognizable, non-bailable criminal offence, until the relevant law was overturned by the Supreme Court of India on 27 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abplive.in/india-news/adultery-can-be-treated-as-civil-wrong-but-not-criminal-supreme-court-760349|title=Supreme Court quashes Section 497, says 'Adultery not a criminal offence'|last=Bureau|first=ABP News|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
Punishments for adultery vary from place to place. Where adultery is illegal, the punishment varies from fines (for example in the US state of [[Rhode Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/2012/title-11/chapter-11-6/chapter-11-6-2/|title=2012 Rhode Island General Laws :: Title 11 - Criminal Offenses :: Chapter 11-6 - Bigamy and Adultery :: Chapter 11-6-2 - Adultery.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to caning in parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/150-women-face-adultery-flogging-on-maldives-1757150.html|title=150 women face adultery flogging on Maldives|publisher=|date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/malaysia.adultery.caning/index.html|title=3 women caned in Malaysia for adultery - CNN.com|first=By  Joe Sterling|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"/&gt; countries in which [[stoning]] is authorized as lawful punishment, although in recent times it has been legally enforced only in Iran and Somalia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Most stoning cases are the result of [[mob violence]], and while technically illegal, no action is usually taken against perpetrators. Sometimes such stonings are ordered by informal village leaders who have ''de facto'' power in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/asia/afghanistan-taliban-woman-stoning/index.html|title=Afghan woman stoned to death over adultery accusation - CNN|first=Jethro Mullen and Masoud Popalzai|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adultery may have consequences under [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] even in countries where it is not outlawed by the [[criminal law]]. For instance it may constitute ''fault'' in countries where the [[divorce law]] is [[Divorce#At-fault divorce|fault based]] or it may be a ground for [[tort]].

In some societies the law punishes the "intruder", rather than the adulterous spouse. For instance art 266 of the Penal Code of South Sudan reads: "Whoever,  has  consensual  sexual  intercourse  with  a  man  or woman who is and whom he or she has reason to believe to be the spouse of another person, commits the offence of adultery [...]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ss/ss014en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, under the [[adultery law in India]] (Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, until overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018) it was a criminal offense for a man to have consensual sexual intercourse with a married woman, without the consent of her husband (no party was criminally punished in case of adultery between a married man and an unmarried woman).

==Legal issues regarding paternity==
{{Further|Paternity (law)|Legitimacy (family law)}}
[[File:Jana2Navarra hlava.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|[[Joan II of Navarre]]{{snd}}her paternity and succession rights were disputed her whole life because her mother [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] was claimed to have committed adultery.]]
Historically, paternity of children born out of adultery has been seen as a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable [[contraception]] and [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless have a legal presumption that a woman's husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a [[rebuttable presumption]], many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challenged{{snd}}such as a certain number of years from the birth of the child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biojuris.com/natural/3-2-0.html |title=Natural Selection in Family Law |publisher=Biojuris.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to [[inheritance]].

Children born out of adultery suffered, until recently, adverse legal and social consequences. In [[France]], for instance, a law that stated that the inheritance rights of a child born under such circumstances were, on the part of the married parent, half of what they would have been under ordinary circumstances, remained in force until 2001, when France was forced to change it by a ruling of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) (and in 2013, the ECtHR also ruled that the new 2001 regulations must be also applied to children born ''before'' 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-116716#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-116716%22]}|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been, in recent years, a trend of legally favoring the right to a relation between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the 'social' family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him from seeing the children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226171503/http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument |date=February 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman world===
{{Further|Adultery in Classical Athens}}

In the [[Greco-Roman world]], there were stringent laws against adultery, but these applied to sexual intercourse with a married woman. In the early [[Roman Law]], the ''jus tori'' belonged to the husband. It was therefore not a crime against the wife for a husband to have sex with a slave or an unmarried woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adultery|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dig., XLVIII, ad leg. Jul.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman husband often took advantage of his legal immunity. Thus we are told by the historian [[Spartianus]] that [[Verus (senator)|Verus]], the imperial colleague of [[Marcus Aurelius]], did not hesitate to declare to his reproaching wife: "Uxor enim dignitatis nomen est, non voluptatis." ('''Wife' connotes rank, not sexual pleasure'', or more literally "Wife is the name of dignity, not bliss") (Verus, V).

Later in Roman history, as William E.H. Lecky has shown, the idea that the husband owed a fidelity similar to that demanded of the wife must have gained ground, at least in theory. Lecky gathers from the [[legal maxim]] of [[Ulpian]]: "It seems most unfair for a man to require from a wife the chastity he does not himself practice".&lt;ref&gt;Codex Justin., Digest, XLVIII, 5–13; Lecky, History of European Morals, II, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], the lending of wives practiced among some people was also encouraged by [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], though from a motive other than that which actuated the practice (Plutarch, Lycurgus, XXIX). The recognized license of the Greek husband may be seen in the following passage of the [[pseudo-Demosthenes|pseudo-Demosthenic]] ''[[Against Neaera|Oration Against Neaera]]'':

:''We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines for constant attendance, and wives to bear us legitimate children and to be our faithful housekeepers. Yet, because of the wrong done to the husband only, the Athenian lawgiver Solon allowed any man to kill an adulterer whom he had taken in the act.'' (Plutarch, Solon)

The Roman [[Lex Julia]], ''Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis'' (17 BC), punished adultery with banishment.&lt;ref name="UNRV History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/government/julianmarriage.php |title=The Julian marriage laws |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two guilty parties were sent to different islands ("dummodo in ''diversas'' insulas relegentur"), and part of their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name="UNRV History" /&gt; Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.

===Abrahamic religions===

====Christianity====
{{Main|Thou shalt not commit adultery}}
[[File:Nathan and David.jpg|thumb|'Thou shalt not commit adultery' (Nathan confronts David); bronze bas-relief on the door of the [[La Madeleine, Paris]], [[Paris]].]]

The [[Hebrew Bible]] prohibits adultery in the Seventh Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:12|HE}}). {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|NIV}} prescribes [[capital punishment]] for adultery between a man and married woman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Significantly, the penalty does not extend to sex by an unmarried woman and irrespective of the marital status of the man.

Furthermore, Deuteronomic code prescribes [[stoning]] not only for female [[extramarital sex]], but also for female [[premarital sex]] in the case where the woman lies about her virginity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, … and say, / I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid. / … But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: / Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:13-21]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also prescribes the same for engaged women who lie with another man, under the premise that if she allows the action without protesting, this indicates willingness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; / Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:23-24]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adultery is considered by Christians to be immoral and a [[sin]], based primarily on passages like {{bibleverse|Exodus|20:14|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9–10|NIV}}. Although {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:11|NIV}} does say that "and that is what some of you were. But you were washed", it still acknowledges adultery to be immoral and a sin.

Some churches have interpreted adultery to include all sexual relationships outside of marriage, regardless of the marital status of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/adultery |title=Guide to the Scriptures: Adultery |publisher=lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]] ties [[fornication]] with breaking the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] in its [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sixth commandment |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 October 1951 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until a few decades ago, adultery was a criminal offense in many countries where the dominant religion is Christianity, especially in [[Roman Catholic]] countries (see also the section on [[Adultery#Europe|Europe]]). Adultery was decriminalized in [[Argentina]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="impowr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-adultery-argentina |title=Current Legal Framework: Adultery in Argentina |publisher=impowr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Brazil]] in 2005;&lt;ref name="iwraw-ap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/resources/pdf/BRAZIL_SHADOWREPORT_CEDAW_June,18%5B1%5D.pdf |title=BRAZIL AND COMPLIANCE WITH CEDAW |date=February 1, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225023/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/resources/pdf/BRAZIL_SHADOWREPORT_CEDAW_June%2C18%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some predominantly Catholic countries, such as the Philippines, it remains illegal. The [[Book of Mormon]] also prohibits adultery. For instance, Abinadi cites the [[Ten Commandments]] when he accuses [[King Noah]]'s priests of sexual immorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.22?lang=eng#21|title=Mosiah 13:22|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Jesus Christ]] visits the Americas he reinforces the law and teaches them the higher law (also found in the [[New Testament]]):

:''Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.27?lang=eng#26|title=3 Nephi 12:27|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Book of Mormon]] [[List of Book of Mormon prophets|prophets]] and civil leaders often list adultery as an illegal activity along with murder, robbing, and stealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.10?lang=eng|title=Alma 30:10|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
Adultery in Judaism is prohibited by the Seventh Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.". Adultery in traditional Judaism applies to both parties, but depends on the marital status of the woman (Lev. 20:10). Though the [[Torah]] prescribes the death penalty for adultery, the legal procedural requirements were very exacting and required the testimony of two eyewitnesses of good character for conviction. The defendant also must have been warned immediately before performing the act.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonidies, Book of the Commandments, Prohibition 392 and the note at the end of Prohibition 347, Hebrew translation and notes by Rabbi Joseph Kapach, Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  A death sentence could be issued only during the period when the [[Holy Temple]] stood, and only so long as the [[Sanhedrin|Supreme Torah]] Court convened in its chamber within the Temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides Mishneh Torah: Laws of Sanhedrin 14:11&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, therefore, no death penalty applies.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Tractate Ketuvoth 30a,b&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty for adultery was strangulation,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Tractate Sanhedrin, folio 52b, towards the bottom&lt;/ref&gt; except in the case of a woman who was the daughter of a Kohain (Aaronic priestly caste), which was specifically mentioned by Scripture by the death penalty of burning (pouring molten lead down the throat).&lt;ref&gt;Lev. 21:9&lt;/ref&gt; Ipso facto, there never was mentioned in Pharisaic or Rabbinic Judaism sources a punishment of stoning for adulterers as mentioned in John 8.

At the civil level, however, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (halakha) forbids a man to continue living with an adulterous wife, and he is obliged to divorce her. Also, an adulteress is not permitted to marry the adulterer, but, to avoid any doubt as to her status as being free to marry another or that of her children, many authorities say he must give her a divorce as if they were married.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Way in Love &amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp; Row, San Francisco,1980&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judaism, the [[Seven laws of Noah]] apply to all of humankind; these laws prohibit adultery with another man's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Judges, Laws of Kings and Wars, Chapter 7 (Shabse Frankel edition, Jerusalem - B'nai B'rak, 5762 (c.2008, copyright 1998))&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ten Commandments]] were meant exclusively for Jewish males.&lt;ref name=coogan102/&gt; [[Michael Coogan]] writes that according to the text the wives are the property of their man, marriage meaning transfer of property (from father to husband),&lt;ref name=coogan102&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and Sex.

Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married or [[Engagement|betrothed]] was not considered adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. F. (1992). "Ten Commandments." In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 6, p. 386). New York: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adultery.html|title=Adultery|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David]]'s sexual intercourse with [[Bathsheba]], the wife of Uriah, did not count as adultery. According Jennifer Wright Knust, this was because [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] was no Jew, and only Jewish men were protected by the legal code from Sinai.&lt;ref name="Knust2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jennifer|last=Wright Knust|title=Unprotected Texts: The Bible's Surprising Contradictions About Sex and Desire|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trMblwEACAAJ|date=25 January 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-172558-6|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to the Babylonian Talmud, Uriah was indeed Jewish &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud|chapter-url=http://juchre.org/talmud/kiddushin/kiddushin4.htm#76b|chapter=kiddushin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43681/was-uriah-jewish|title=Was Uriah Jewish?|website=Mi Yodeya}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a provisional [[Get (divorce document)|bill of divorce]] prior to going out to war, specifying that if he fell in battle, the divorce would take effect from the time the writ was issued.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |first=John L.|last=Thompson |title =Reading the Bible with the Dead| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWciPOChU9QC | page=200 |publisher = Wm.

====Islam====
{{Main|Zina (Arabic)}}
{{See also|Extramarital sex#Islam}}
[[Zina (Arabic)|Zina]] (زنا) is an Arabic term for illegal intercourse, premarital or extramarital. Various conditions and punishments have been attributed to adultery.

Under [[Sharia|Muslim law]], adultery in general is sexual intercourse by a person (whether man or woman) with someone to whom they are not married. Adultery is a violation of the marital contract and one of the major sins condemned by Allah in the [[Qur'an]]:

Qur'anic verses prohibiting adultery include:

: "Do not go near to adultery. Surely it is a shameful deed and evil, opening roads (to other evils)."{{Cite quran|17|32}}

: "Say, 'Verily, my Lord has prohibited the shameful deeds, be it open or secret, sins and trespasses against the truth and reason.'"{{Cite quran|7|33}}

Punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-quran.info/#&amp;&amp;sura=24&amp;trans=no-einar_berg&amp;show=both,quran-uthmani&amp;format=rows&amp;ver=1.00 Online Qur'an Project Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from [[slander]] and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asmasociety.org/perspectives/article_8.html |title=American Muslims need to speak out against violations of Islamic Shariah law |publisher=Asmasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705191356/http://www.asmasociety.org///perspectives/article_8.html |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Muhammad, an unmarried person who commits adultery or fornication is punished by flogging 100 times; a married person will then be [[stoning|stoned]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found support for stoning as a punishment for adultery mostly in [[Arab countries]]; it was supported in [[Egypt]] (82% of respondents in favor of the punishment) and [[Jordan]] (70% in favor), as well as [[Pakistan]] (82% favor), whereas in [[Nigeria]] (56% in favor) and in [[Indonesia]] (42% in favor) opinion is more divided, perhaps due to diverging traditions and differing interpretations of Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah |title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah Retrieved 2011-06-02 |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
The Hindu Sanskrit texts present a range of views on adultery, offering widely differing positions.&lt;ref name="Harlan161"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawton2007p22&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clive Lawton|author2=Peggy Morgan|title=Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7QQAQAAIAAJ |year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2329-7|pages=22 }}, Quote: "The Sanskrit texts also take widely differing positions on adultery. Some see it as a minor offence: after menstruation and some penances, the woman is purified again. An adulterous husband may merely have to undergo some mild penances. But other texts advocate even the death penalty for either the man or the woman, depending on the caste status."&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn 4.5.5 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' calls adultery as ''pāpa'' (evil, sin).&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=7 with footnote 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie Jamison|author2=Joel Brereton|title=The Rigveda: 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgzVAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972078-1|page=566}} Quote, [https://sa.wikisource.org/s/13s7 Sanskrit]: अभ्रातरो न योषणो व्यन्तः पतिरिपो न जनयो दुरेवाः । पापासः सन्तो अनृता असत्या इदं पदमजनता गभीरम् ॥५॥ Translation: "(You) pursuing (it) like brotherless maidens pursuing (men), (you) of evil ways like wives cheating (their) husbands, though being wicked, untruthful, untrue, you begot this deep track"&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vedic texts, states Rick Talbott, state adultery to be a sin, just like murder, incest, anger, evil thoughts and trickery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick F.

The ''Kamasutra'', states [[Ludo Rocher]], discusses adultery and Vatsyayana devotes "not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (''karana'') for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rocher | first=Ludo | title=The Kāmasūtra: Vātsyāyana's Attitude toward Dharma and Dharmaśāstra | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=105 | issue=3 | year=1985 | doi=10.2307/601526 | pages=527| jstor=601526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wendy Doniger, the ''Kamasutra'' teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|editor=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Sense of Adharma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6bsOfvySvMC |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802448-4|pages=170–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kamasutra'' teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both ''dharma'' and ''artha''.&lt;ref name=doniger2016p14/&gt;

According to Werner Menski, the Sanskrit texts take a "widely different positions on adultery", with some considering it a minor offense that can be addressed with penance, but others treat it as a severe offense that depending on the caste deserves the death penalty for the man or the woman.&lt;ref name=lawton2007p22/&gt; According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathryn S.

According to Carl Olsen, the classical Hindu society considered adultery as a sexual transgression but treated it with a degree of tolerance.&lt;ref name="Olson2007p261"/&gt; It is described as a minor transgression in ''Naradasmriti'' and other texts, one that a sincere penance could atone.&lt;ref name="Olson2007p261"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;pg=PA261 |year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, [[Krishna]] commits adultery and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2| pages=288–291 with footnotes 83, 89, 101–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is ''prema'' or "selfless, true love" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value.&lt;ref name="Bose2018p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Coleman|editor=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Oxford History of Hinduism: The Goddess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_tdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-107968-9|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example of Krishna's adulterous behavior has been used by Sahajiyas Hindus of Bengal to justify their own behavior that is contrary to the mainstream Hindu norm, according to Doniger.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt; Other Hindu texts state that Krishna's adultery is not a license for other men to do the same, in the same way that men should not drink poison just because Rudra-Shiva drank poison during the Samudra Manthan.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt; A similar teaching is found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Doniger.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhist texts such as [[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]] describe adultery as a form of sexual wrongdoing that is one link in a chain of immorality and misery. According to Wendy Doniger, this view of adultery as evil is postulated in early Buddhist texts as having originated from greed in a [[rebirth (Buddhism)|previous life]]. This idea combines Hindu and Buddhist thoughts then prevalent.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p33"/&gt; [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentient beings]] without body, state the [[Tripitaka|canonical texts]], are reborn on earth due to their greed and craving, some people become beautiful and some ugly, some become men and some women. The ugly envy the beautiful and this triggers the ugly to commit adultery with the wives of the beautiful. Like in [[Hindu mythology]], states Doniger, Buddhist texts explain adultery as a result from sexual craving; it initiates a degenerative process.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]] |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=33–34, n. 102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism considers celibacy as the monastic ideal. For he who feels that he cannot live in celibacy, it recommends that he never commit adultery with another's wife.&lt;ref name="Harvey2000p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC&amp;pg=PA71 |year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|pages=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaging in sex outside of marriage, with the wife of another man, with a girl who is engaged to be married, or a girl protected by her relatives (father or brother), or extramarital sex with prostitutes, ultimately causes suffering to other human beings and oneself. It should be avoided, state the Buddhist canonical texts.&lt;ref name="Harvey2000p71"/&gt;

Buddhist Pali texts narrate legends where the Buddha explains the karmic consequences of adultery. For example, states Robert Goldman, one such story is of Thera Soreyya.&lt;ref name="Goldman1993p374"/&gt; Buddha states in the Soreyya story that "men who commit adultery suffer hell for hundreds of thousands of years after rebirth, then are reborn a hundred successive times as women on earth, must earn merit by "utter devotion to their husbands" in these lives, before they can be reborn again as men to pursue a monastic life and liberation from ''samsara''.&lt;ref name="Goldman1993p374"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Goldman | first=Robert P. | title=Transsexualism, Gender, and Anxiety in Traditional India | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=113 | issue=3 | year=1993 | issn=0003-0279 | doi=10.2307/605387 | pages=377–381| jstor=605387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dharmasena|author2=R Obeyesekere|title=Portraits of Buddhist Women: Stories from the Saddharmaratnavaliya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvWA5wlIWnQC |year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5111-3|pages=213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some differences between the Buddhist texts and the Hindu texts on the identification and consequences of adultery. According to José Ignacio Cabezón, for example, the Hindu text ''Naradasmriti'' considers consensual extra-marital sex between a man and a woman in certain circumstances (such as if the husband has abandoned the woman) as not a punishable crime, but the Buddhist texts "nowhere exculpate" any adulterous relationship. The term adultery in ''Naradasmriti'' is broader in scope than the one in Buddhist sources. In the text, various acts such as secret meetings, exchange of messages and gifts, "inappropriate touching" and a false accusation of adultery, are deemed adulterous, while Buddhist texts do not recognize these acts under adultery.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p454"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Ignacio Cabezón|title=Sexuality in Classical South Asian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCjhDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA454|year=2017|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-61429-368-2|pages=454–455, footnote 1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later texts such as the ''Dhammapada'', ''Pancasiksanusamsa Sutra'' and a few Mahayana sutras state that "heedless man who runs after other men's wife" acquire demerit, blame, discomfort and are reborn in hell.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p44"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Ignacio Cabezón|title=Sexuality in Classical South Asian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCjhDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA454|year=2017|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-61429-368-2|pages=44–45, footnotes 79 and 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Buddhist texts make no mention of legal punishments for adultery.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p454"/&gt;

In the tenth century, the Arab explorer [[Ibn Fadlan]] noted that adultery was unknown among the pagan [[Oghuz Turks]]. Ibn Fadlan writes that "adultery is unknown among them; but whomsoever they find by his conduct that he is an adulterer, they tear him in two. This comes about so: they bring together the branches of two trees, tie him to the branches and then let both trees go, so that he is torn in two."&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad Ibn Faḍlān, Richard Nelson Frye, ''Ibn Fadlan's journey to Russia: a tenth-century traveler from Baghad to the Volga River'', Markus Wiener Publishers, 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and its successor states, it has been [[high treason]] to engage in adultery with the King's wife, his eldest son's wife and his eldest unmarried daughter. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that "the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious." Adultery was a serious issue when it came to succession to the crown. [[Philip IV of France]] had all three of his daughters-in-law imprisoned, two ([[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy]]) on the grounds of adultery and the third ([[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]) for being aware of their adulterous behaviour. The two brothers accused of being lovers of the king's daughters-in-law were executed immediately after being arrested. The wife of Philip IV's eldest son bore a daughter, the future [[Joan II of Navarre]], whose paternity and succession rights were disputed all her life.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[christianization of Europe]] came to mean that, in theory, and unlike with the Romans, there was supposed to be a single sexual standard, where adultery was a sin and against the teachings of the church, regardless of the sex of those involved. In practice, however, the church seemed to have accepted the traditional double standard which punished the adultery of the wife more harshly than that of the husband.&lt;ref name="web.clark.edu"&gt;http://web.clark.edu/afisher/HIST252/lectures_text/Women%20in%20the%20Early%20Middle%20Ages.pdf, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150319072837/http://web.clark.edu/afisher/HIST252/lectures_text/Women%20in%20the%20Early%20Middle%20Ages.pdf Web archive link]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Germanic tribes, each tribe had its own laws for adultery, and many of them allowed the husband to "take the law in his hands" and commit acts of violence against a wife caught committing adultery.&lt;ref name="web.clark.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=BULLOUGH |first1=VERN L. |title=Medieval Concepts of Adultery |journal=Arthuriana |date=1997 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=5–15 |jstor=27869285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, adultery in [[Vienna]] was punishable by death through [[impalement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.wdr.de/themen/archiv/stichtag/stichtag1344.html|title=22.

In [[Pakistan]], adultery is a crime under the [[Hudood Ordinance]], promulgated in 1979. The Ordinance sets a maximum penalty of [[capital punishment|death]]. The Ordinance has been particularly controversial because it requires a woman making an accusation of [[rape]] to provide extremely strong evidence to avoid being charged with adultery herself. A conviction for rape is only possible with evidence from no fewer than four witnesses. In recent years high-profile rape cases in Pakistan have given the Ordinance more exposure than similar laws in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/13/nat2.htm Hudood laws open to change in Pakistan], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Similar laws exist in some other Muslim countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Brunei#Adultery|Brunei]].

In Southwest Asia, adultery has attracted severe [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[death penalty]]. In some places, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], the method of punishment for adultery is [[stoning]] to death. Proving adultery under Muslim law can be a very difficult task as it requires the accuser to produce four eyewitnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply in the application of social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=174|author=Juan Eduardo Campo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning with God: Reclaiming Shari'ah in the Modern Age|author=Khaled Abou El Fadl|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Mackey]], author of ''The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom'', stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Koranic law [for adultery] are extremely rare."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sandra Mackey|Mackey, Sandra]].

In the Philippines, the law differentiates based on the gender of the spouse. A wife can be charged with the crime of ''Adultery'' for having sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband, while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of ''Concubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently proposals to decriminalize adultery in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/363403/news/nation/gabriela-revives-proposal-to-decriminalize-adultery|title=Gabriela revives proposal to decriminalize adultery|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery is no longer a crime in any European country.

In most [[Communist]] countries adultery was not a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=_gsfAQAAIAAJ |title=The Cornell Law Quarterly, Volumul 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]] was an exception, where adultery was a crime until 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/summary-adultery-romania|title=Summary: Adultery in Romania|work=impowr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the crime of adultery had a narrow definition, excluding situations where the other spouse encouraged the act or when the act happened at a time the couple was living separate and apart;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/adulter|title=Adulter|work=legeaz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in practice prosecutions were extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/Social/1962/Dupa-20-de-ani-adulterul-dispare-din-Codul-penal.html | title=Dupa 20 de ani, adulterul dispare din Codul penal | accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]] adultery laws were held to be invalid in 1996/1998 because the law was deemed discriminatory as it differentiated between women and men. In 2004, there were proposals to introduce a gender-neutral adultery law. The plans were dropped, and it has been suggested that the objections from the European Union played a role.&lt;ref name="European Transformation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3654650.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey signals U-turn on adultery | date=2004-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=pnGwP9-FhxYC |title=Deconstructing Sexuality in the Middle East: Challenges and Discourses }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 20th century, adultery was often punished harshly. In Scandinavia, in the 17th century, adultery and bigamy were subject to the [[death penalty]], although few people were actually executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=Ad0_J6T-YDQC |title=A Lutheran Plague: Murdering to Die in the Eighteenth Century }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of women who have been executed for adultery in Medieval and Early Modern Europe include [[Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria]] (in 1256), [[Agnese Visconti]] (in 1391), [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda]] (in 1418), [[Anne Boleyn]] (in 1536), and [[Catherine Howard]] (in 1542). The enforcement of adultery laws varied by jurisdiction. In England, the last execution for adultery is believed to have taken place in 1654, when a woman named Susan Bounty was [[hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/arts_at_oxford/121602_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411072534/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/arts_at_oxford/121602_1.html |archivedate=2014-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) has had the opportunity to rule in recent years on several cases involving the legitimacy of firing a person from their job due to adultery. These cases dealt with people working for religious organizations and raised the question of the balancing of the right of a person to respect for their private life (recognized in the EU) and the right of religious communities to be protected against undue interference by the State (recognized also in the EU). These situations must be analyzed with regard to their specific circumstances, in each case. The ECtHR had ruled both in favor of the religious organization (in the case of Obst) and in favor of the fired person (in the case of Schüth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-3272505-3650095#{%22itemid%22:[%22003-3272505-3650095%22]}|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Adultery is not a crime in Australia. Under federal law enacted in 1994, sexual conduct between consenting adults (18 years of age or older) is their private matter throughout Australia,&lt;ref name="act1994"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act'' 1994 |publisher=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hrca1994297/s4.html |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of marital status. Australian states and territories had previously repealed their respective adultery criminal laws. Australia changed to [[no-fault divorce]] in 1975, abolishing adultery as a ground for divorce.

In the last conviction for adultery in Massachusetts in 1983, it was held that the statute was constitutional and that "no fundamental personal privacy right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty guaranteed by the United States Constitution bars the criminal prosecution of such persons  [adulterers]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/389/389mass171.html |title=STOWELL, COMMONWEALTH vs., 389 Mass. 171 |publisher=Masscases.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts repealed its adultery law in 2018.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

[[South Carolina]]'s adultery law came into spotlight in 2009, when then governor [[Mark Sanford]] admitted to his extramarital affair. He was not prosecuted for it; it is not clear whether South Carolina could prosecute a crime that occurred in another jurisdiction (Argentina in this case); furthermore, under South Carolina law adultery involves either "the living together and carnal intercourse with each other" or, if those involved do not live together "''habitual'' carnal intercourse with each other" which is more difficult to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c015.php |title=South Carolina Legislature Mobile |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since adultery is still a crime in Virginia, persons in divorce proceedings may use the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Any criminal convictions for adultery can determine alimony and asset distribution. In 2016 there was a bill in Virginia to decriminalize adultery and make it only a civil offense, but the [[Virginia Senate]] did not advance the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Liz.

In the [[U.S. military]], adultery is a potential [[court-martial]] offense.&lt;ref name="usmilitary.about.com"/&gt; The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States is unclear following [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., [[Lawrence v.

===Criticism of adultery laws===
{{See also|Alienation of affections#Criticism}}

====Political arguments====
Laws against adultery have been named as invasive and incompatible with principles of [[limited government]] (see Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate) chapter 2). Much of the criticism comes from [[libertarianism]], the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than [[Prosecution|prosecuted]] and [[Sanctions (law)|penalized]] by [[public entities]]. It is also argued that adultery laws are rooted in religious doctrines; which should not be the case for laws in a [[secular state]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Opponents of adultery laws regard them as painfully archaic, believing they represent sanctions reminiscent of nineteenth-century novels. They further object to the legislation of morality, especially a morality so steeped in religious doctrine. Support for the preservation of the adultery laws comes from religious groups and from political parties who feel quite independent of morality, that the government has reason to concern itself with the consensual sexual activity of its citizens … The crucial question is: when, if ever, is the government justified to interfere in consensual bedroom affairs?&lt;ref&gt;Weissler, Benjamin. "[http://yulr.org/government-and-the-bedroom/ Government and the Bedroom]." July 13, 2012. ''Yale Undergraduate Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a history of adultery laws being abused. In [[Somerset]], England, a somewhat common practice was for husbands to encourage their wives to seduce another man, who they would then [[Lawsuit|sue]] or [[blackmail]], under laws (for examples see [[Criminal conversation]]) prohibiting men from having sex with women married to other men.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, David. "[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201006/kinky-cuckolding-fetish-goes-mainstream Kinky Cuckolding Fetish Goes Mainstream]". ''Psychology Today''. June 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical context====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Historically, in most cultures, laws against adultery were enacted only to prevent women—and not men—from having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} since women were deemed their husbands' [[property]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} with adultery being often defined as sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man other than her husband.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Among many cultures the [[punishment|penalty]] was—and to this day still is, as noted [[Adultery#Violence|below]]—[[capital punishment]]. At the same time, men were free to maintain sexual relations with any women ([[polygyny]]) provided that the women did not already have husbands or "owners". Indeed, [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the [[Bible]], is synonymous with ''owner''. These laws were enacted in fear of [[cuckoldry]] and thus [[sexual jealousy]]. Many indigenous customs, such as [[female genital mutilation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[menstrual taboo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strassman | first1 = B.I. | year = 1992 | title = The function of menstrual taboos among the Dogon: defense against cuckoldry? | doi = 10.1007/bf02692249 | pmid = 24222401 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 89–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been theorized to have originated as preventive measures against cuckolding. This arrangement has been deplored by many modern intellectuals.

====Discrimination against women====
Opponents of adultery laws argue that these laws maintain social norms which justify violence, discrimination and oppression of women; in the form of state sanctioned forms of violence such as [[stoning]], [[flogging]] or [[hanging]] for adultery; or in the form of individual acts of violence committed against women by husbands or relatives, such as [[honor killings]], [[crimes of passion]], and beatings.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp; |title=Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice |work=ohchr.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306103836/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp; |archivedate=2015-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endvawnow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|work=endvawnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Women]] has called for the decriminalization of adultery.&lt;ref name="endvawnow.org"/&gt; A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in 2012, stated:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice is deeply concerned at the criminalization and penalization of adultery whose enforcement leads to discrimination and [[violence against women]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns exist that the existence of "adultery" as a criminal offense (and even in family law) can affect the criminal justice process in cases of domestic assaults and killings, in particular by mitigating [[murder]] to [[manslaughter]],&lt;ref&gt;With regard to the situation in the United States: "Moreover, setting to one side criminal prosecutions for adultery, there are numerous other ways in which the law deems adulterous conduct to be legally relevant. (...) Furthermore, a recognized "heat of passion" defense to a charge of murdering one’s spouse or paramour—which will typically reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter—is either finding them in the act of adultery, recently being informed of their act of adultery, or in some jurisdictions, having reason to believe that they committed adultery."&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise proving for partial or complete defenses in case of violence. These concerns have been officially raised by the Council of Europe and the UN in recent years. The [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence] states that member states should: (...) "57. preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - on the protection of women against violence|author=((Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Plenary))|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Women]] has also stated in regard to the defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] and other similar defenses that "laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of 'honour', adultery, or domestic assault or murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|publisher=endvawnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of limited resources of the criminal law enforcement====
An argument against the criminal status of adultery is that the resources of the law enforcement are limited, and that they should be used carefully; by investing them in the investigation and prosecution of adultery (which is very difficult) the curbing of serious violent crimes may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;''Suffolk law review, The Validity of Criminal Adultery Prohibitions After Lawrence v.Texas''; pg. 859 "Lack of enforcement suggests the prevailing view that police resources are better spent elsewhere."[http://suffolklawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/Viator_Note_Final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The importance of consent as the basis of sexual offenses legislation====
Human rights organizations have stated that legislation on sexual crimes must be based on [[consent]], and must recognize consent as central, and not trivialize its importance; doing otherwise can lead to legal, social or ethical abuses. Amnesty International, when condemning stoning legislation that targets adultery, among other acts, has referred to "acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punish |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420193225/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punish |archivedate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's Secretary General, said: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning [[child marriage]] and [[marital rape]] while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity{{snd}}even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140625235455/https://campaigns.amnesty.org/campaigns/my-body-my-rights My Body My Rights]'' campaign has condemned state control over individual sexual and reproductive decisions; stating "All over the world, people are coerced, criminalized and discriminated against, simply for making choices about their bodies and their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT35/001/2014/en|title=Document - Amnesty International - Amnesty International|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===General===
For various reasons, most couples who marry do so with the expectation of [[Wiktionary:fidelity|fidelity]]. Adultery is often seen as a breach of trust and of the commitment that had been made during the act of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, "Adultery" |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427092349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery| archivedate= 27 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adultery can be emotionally traumatic for both spouses and often results in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About.com Divorce Support, "Why Does Infidelity Often Lead to Divorce?" |url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/b/2011/05/12/why-does-infidelity-often-lead-to-divorce.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a new work, ''The New Rules'' by Dr Catherine Hakim, a British sociologist and author, refers to the United Kingdom arguing that a "sour and rigid English view" of [[Wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] as opposed to the 'wonderful French way' of male infidelity is condemning millions of people to live frustrated "celibate" lives with their spouses. She argues that there is such a thing as a "successful affair" in which both parties are happier but no one gets hurt: "Sex is no more a moral issue than eating a good meal," she writes. "The fact that we eat most meals at home with spouses and partners does not preclude eating out in restaurants to sample different cuisines and ambiences, with friends or colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mother Tongue |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9485796/Puritan-view-of-adultery-turns-Brits-into-caged-animals-says-academic.html |title=Puritan view of adultery turns Brits into 'caged animals' says academic |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2012-08-20|accessdate=2013-09-28 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery may lead to ostracization from certain religious or social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6017|title=Library : Women as Guardians of Purity|work=catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery can also lead to feelings of guilt and jealousy in the person with whom the affair is being committed. In some cases, this "third person" may encourage divorce (either openly or subtly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs of a Cheating Husband |url=http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21 |publisher=Beatingjealousy.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905054412/http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21 |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cheating spouse has hinted at divorce in order to continue the affair, the third person may feel deceived if that does not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are You the Other Woman in an Affair |url=http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html |publisher=Essortment.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326012438/http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Getting Over an Affair as the Other Woman |url=http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/community-features/ask-an-expert/questions-by-topic/infidelity/577-getting-over-an-affair-as-the-other-woman.html|publisher= Truthaboutdeception.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may simply withdraw with ongoing feelings of guilt, carry on an obsession with their lover, may choose to reveal the affair, or in rare cases commit violence or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Fisher|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|publisher=trutv.com|accessdate=2011-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125221246/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|archive-date=2009-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is correlation, there is no evidence that divorces ''causes'' children to have struggles in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=nasponline.org, Divorce: A Parents' Guide for Supporting Children |url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/parenting/divorce_ho.aspx|publisher= nasponline.org |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If adultery leads to divorce, it also carries higher financial burdens.&lt;ref name="divorcehq.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, "Comparison of the Average Cost of Divorce Fees" |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/comparisonfees.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, living expenses and taxes are generally cheaper for married couples than for divorced couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=attorneys.com, "The Hidden Costs of Divorce" |url=http://www.attorneys.com/legal_center/articles/divorce/s/c/the_hidden_costs_of_divorce:_don't_overlook_these_expenses/ |publisher=attorneys.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703022300/http://www.attorneys.com/legal_center/articles/divorce/s/c/the_hidden_costs_of_divorce%3A_don%27t_overlook_these_expenses/ |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal fees can add up into the tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="divorcehq.com"/&gt;  Divorced spouses may not qualify for benefits such as health insurance, which must then be paid out-of-pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, "Divorce and COBRA" |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/divorce_cobra.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on jurisdiction, adultery may negatively affect the outcome of the divorce for the "guilty" spouse, even if adultery is not a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-adultery-chile|title=Current Legal Framework: Adultery in Chile|work=impowr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexually transmitted infections===
{{Further|Sexually transmitted disease}}
Like any sexual contact, extramarital sex opens the possibility of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=family.jrank.org, "Birth Control{{snd}}Contraceptive Methods, Sociocultural and Historical Aspects" |url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/163/Birth-Control.html|publisher= jrank.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a [[public health]] issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriers{{snd}}to openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited.&lt;ref&gt;http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-12032012-153412/unrestricted/dissertation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aids2031.org/pdfs/safe%20and%20consensual%20sex%20are%20women%20empowered%20enough%20to%20negotiate.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101002/http://www.aids2031.org/pdfs/safe%20and%20consensual%20sex%20are%20women%20empowered%20enough%20to%20negotiate.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gender power imbalance on women's capacity to negotiate self-protection against HIV/AIDS in Botswana and South Africa | pmc=1831928 | pmid=16245988 | doi=10.5555/afhs.2005.5.3.188 | volume=5 | issue=3 | year=2005 | journal=Afr Health Sci | pages=188–97 | last1 = Langen | first1 = TT| doi-broken-date=2018-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of [[HIV/AIDS]], because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they thought they have been infected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
[[File:Adulteri.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Inca]] woman and man to be stoned for adultery, by [[Huamán Poma]] ]]
Historically, female adultery often resulted in extreme violence, including [[murder]] (of the woman, her lover, or both, committed by her husband). Today, domestic violence is outlawed in most countries.

===Honor killings===
{{Main|Honor killing}}
[[Honor killings]] are often connected to accusations of adultery. Honor killings [[Honor killing#By region|continue to be practiced in some parts of the world]], particularly (but not only) in parts of South Asia and the Middle East. Honor killings are treated leniently in some legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;According to the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83): The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Honor killings have also taken place in immigrant communities in Europe, Canada and the U.S. In some parts of the world, honor killings enjoy considerable public support: in one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan's capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22992365|title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings'|newspaper=BBC News|date=2013-06-20|last1=Maher|first1=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in [[Diyarbakir]], Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - 'Honour' crime defiance in Turkey|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2009, in [[Syria]], it was legal for a husband to kill or injure his wife or his female relatives caught in [[flagrante delicto]] committing adultery or other illegitimate sexual acts. The law has changed to allow the perpetrator to only "benefit from the attenuating circumstances, provided that he serves a prison term of no less than two years in the case of killing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=28169&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=1263 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416012813/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=28169&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=1263 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other articles also provide for reduced sentences. Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: No Exceptions for Honor Killings|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/28/syria-no-exceptions-honor-killings|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2011-12-08|date=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Jordan has amended its Criminal Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/belief-that-honour-killings-are-justified-still-prevalent-among-jordans-next-generation-study-shows|title=Belief that honour killings are 'justified' still prevalent among Jordan's next generation, study shows|date=20 June 2013|work=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN in 2002:

:"The report of the [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] ... concerning cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (E/CN.4/2002/83), indicated that honour killings had been reported in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]], [[Yemen]], and other Mediterranean and Persian Gulf countries, and that they had also taken place in western countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, within migrant communities."&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu-Ghanem women speak out against serial 'honor killings'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=2007-02-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225090106/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html| archivedate= 25 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimes of passion===
{{Main|Crime of passion}}
[[Crimes of passion]] are often triggered by jealousy, and, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], "have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|work=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoning===
{{Main|Stoning}}
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies, or the condemned person is pushed from a platform set high enough above a stone floor that the fall would probably result in instantaneous death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html|title = Examining Halcha, Jewish issues and secular law|last = Rapps|first = Dennis|author2 = Weinberg, Lewin|date = December 1999|work = Jewish Law:Legal briefs|publisher = Ira Kasdan|accessdate=2009-10-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091105092848/http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html| archivedate= 5 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning continues to be practiced today, in parts of the world. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan by tribal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include:

===Flogging===
{{Main|Flogging|Judicial corporal punishment}}
In some jurisdictions [[flogging]] is a punishment for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10890137|title=Five flogged in Indonesia despite human rights protests|newspaper=BBC News|date=2010-08-06|last1=Vaswani|first1=Karishma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/01/world/asia/brunei-sharia-law/|title=Brunei adopts sharia law amid international outcry|author=Arshiya Khullar |date=1 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also incidents of extrajudicial floggings, ordered by informal religious courts. In 2011, a 14-year-old girl in Bangladesh died after being publicly lashed, when she was accused of having an affair with a married man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21962">An '''adventure playground''' is a specific type of [[playground]] for children.  Adventure playgrounds can take many forms, ranging from "natural playgrounds" to "junk playgrounds", and are typically defined by an ethos of unrestricted [[play (activity)|play]], the presence of [[playwork| playworkers]] (or "wardens"), and the absence of adult-manufactured or rigid play-structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/playworkers-ph-ds-and-the-growing-adventure-playground-movement|title= Playworkers, Ph.Ds, and the Growing Adventure Playground Movement |last= Tao |first= Tao Holmes|date= November 6, 2015 |website= atlasobscura.com|publisher= Atlasobscura|access-date= January 29, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt; "Play is a process that is freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated.

== History ==
Harry Shier, in ''Adventure Playgrounds: an introduction'' (1984) defines an Adventure Playground this way:

{{Quote frame |quote=An Adventure Playground is an area fenced off and set aside for children. Within its boundaries children can play freely, in their own way, in their own time. But what is special about an Adventure Playground is that here (and increasingly in contemporary urban society, only here) children can build and shape the environment according to their own creative vision. |author=Harry Shier |title=Adventure Playgrounds: An Introduction |source=NPFA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shier|first= Harry|date= 1984|title= Adventure Playgrounds: an introduction |url= http://www.londonplay.org.uk/resources/0000/1190/1984_Intro_to_APs_Harry_Shier.pdf |location= London, UK|publisher= National Playing Fields Association|page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first ''planned'' playground of this type, the [[Emdrup Junk Playground]], opened in [[Emdrup]], Denmark, in 1943. In 1948, an adventure playground opened in [[Camberwell]], England.  The term "junk playground" is a  [[calque]] from the Danish term ''skrammellegeplads''. Early examples of adventure playgrounds in the UK were known as "junk playgrounds", "waste material playgrounds", or "bomb-site adventure playgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilson |first= Penny|date= 2010 |title= The Playwork Primer|url= http://www.allianceforchildhood.org/sites/allianceforchildhood.org/files/file/PlayworkPrimer_2010.pdf|location= |publisher= Alliance for Childhood |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "adventure playground" was first adopted in the United Kingdom to describe waste material playgrounds "in an effort to make the ‘junk’ playground concept more palatable to local authorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |page = 21|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Denmark===
The first junk playgrounds were based on the ideas of [[C.Th. Sørensen|Carl Theodor Sørensen]], a Danish landscape architect, who noticed that children preferred to play everywhere but in the playgrounds that he designed. In 1931, inspired by the sight of children playing in a construction site, he imagined "A junk playground in which children could create and shape, dream and imagine a reality". His aim was to provide children living in cities the same opportunities for play that were enjoyed by children living in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu/history.html|title= History of Adventure Playgrounds |last= Sutton |first= Lia |date= 2011 |website= adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu/|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first adventure playground was set up by a Workers Cooperative Housing Association in [[Emdrup]], Denmark, during the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupation of the 1940s]].  The playground at [[Emdrup]] grew out of the [[Danish resistance movement|spirit of resistance]] to Nazi occupation and parents' fears that "their children's play might be mistaken for acts of sabotage by soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/36947-when-play-is-criminalized-racial-disparities-in-childhood|title= When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood|last=  Eisa |first= Nefertari Ulen|date=  July 25, 2016 |website=  truth-out.org|publisher= Truth Out |access-date= January 22, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Play advocates sometimes emphasize the importance of adventure playgrounds for children of color in the United States, where policing "can feel like a kind of occupation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/36947-when-play-is-criminalized-racial-disparities-in-childhood|title= When Play Is Criminalized: Racial Disparities in Childhood|last=  Eisa |first= Nefertari Ulen|date=  July 25, 2016 |website=  truth-out.org|publisher= Truth Out |access-date= January 22, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The UK===
[[Marjory Allen, Lady Allen of Hurtwood| Marjory Allen]], an English landscape architect and child welfare advocate, visited and subsequently wrote a widely-read article about the Emdrup Adventure playground titled ''Why Not Use Our Bomb Sites Like This?'' and published in the Picture Post in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Highmore|first= Ben |last2= |first2= |date= 2013 |title= Playgrounds and Bombsites: Postwar Britain's Ruined Landscapes|url= |journal= Cultural Politics |volume= 9|issue= 3|pages= |doi= 10.1215/17432197-2347009 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While [[Marjory Allen, Lady Allen of Hurtwood| Marjory Allen's]] article is often credited with the introduction into the UK of "the idea of transforming bomb sites into 'junk playgrounds', historians of the Adventure playground movement have pointed to the role played by other experiments carried out by [[History of youth work|youth workers]] in the UK. For example, "Marie Paneth, an art therapist heavily influenced by Freud, independently developed the concept of permissive play as a tool for ameliorating childhood aggression in her work running a blitz-era play centre in London although not specifically incorporating the elements of a Junk/Adventure playground pointing to her role in the history of UK specific Playwork development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last= Wilson|first= Reilly Bergin|date= 2014|title= Who Owns the Playground: Space and Power at Lollard Adventure Playground (1954-1961)|type= M.A.|chapter= |publisher= University of Leeds |docket= |oclc= |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Owns_the_Playground.html?id=sk_psgEACAAJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infed.org/youthwork/bm-pan.htm |title= Featured book: Marie Paneth (1944) Branch Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6830">'''Archaeobiology''', the study of the biology of ancient times through archaeological materials, is a [[Archaeological sub-disciplines|subspecialty]] of [[archaeology]]. It can be seen as a blanket term for [[paleobotany]], animal [[osteology]], zooarchaeology, microbiology, and many other sub-disciplines. Specifically, plant and animal remains are also called [[ecofacts]]. Sometimes these ecofacts can be left by humans and sometimes they can be naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Robert|title=Archaeology: Down To Earth|year=2014|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-60864-6|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeobiology tends to focus on more recent finds, so the difference between archaeobiology and [[palaeontology]] is mainly one of date: archaeobiologists typically work with more recent, non-[[fossil]]ised material found at archaeological sites. Only very rarely are archaeobiological excavations performed at sites with no sign of human presence.

==Flora and Fauna in Archaeology==
The prime interest of [[paleobotany]] is to reconstruct the vegetation that people in the past would have encountered in a particular place and time.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant studies have always been overshadowed by faunal studies because bones are more conspicuous than plant remains when excavating.&lt;ref name="Renfrew 2005 245"/&gt; Collection of plant remains could everything including pollen, soil, diatoms, wood, plant remains and [[phytoliths]]. Phytoliths are sediments and diatoms are water deposits. Each plant remain can tell the archaeologist different things about the environment during a certain time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains were the first evidence used by 19th century archaeologists. Today, archaeologists use faunal remains as a guide to the environment. It helps archaeologists understand whether the fauna were present naturally or through activities of carnivores or people.&lt;ref name="Renfrew and Bahn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists deal with [[macrofauna]] and [[microfauna]]. Microfauna are better indicators of climate and environmental change than larger species. These can be as small as a bug or as big as a fish or bird.  Macrofauna helps archaeologists build a picture of past human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, Practice 5th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-500-28713-2|pages=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacteria and Protists in Archaeology==
[[Bacteria]] and [[Protists]] form two separate  kingdoms, but both are fairly similar when compared. Bacteria are [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] microorganisms, while protists are a group of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms. Because both are microorganisms, both fall under the study of [[microbiology]] and special techniques are required for archaeologists to even see them.
Archaeologists, in order to find these microorganisms in a site, have to first take samples from the site and bring them in for lab analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herring|first=Angela|title=Ancient bacteria go under the lens|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2013/10/ancient-bacteria-go-under-the-lens/|publisher=Northeaster.edu|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in the lab, they can use equipment such as [[optical microscope]]s, in order to actually see evidence of micro organic remains. Archaeologists that look at these microorganisms do not actually find the living bacteria or protist, but instead find indentations left behind in material from where they had been. Depending on where the indentations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Stephen|title=Microarchaeology: Beyond the Visible Archaeological Record|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were in the [[strata]], archaeologists can determine the age of the microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Devin|title=Bacterial traces from 3.5 billion years ago are oldest fossils; experts say|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-31/national/36103962_1_australian-rocks-sedimentary-rocks-oldest-fossils|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleomycology==
[[Paleomycology]] is the study of [[fungi]] in the fossil record. The study of past fungi can lead to the evolutionary past. Much of fungi are made up of parasites of animals, plants or insects. Most of the contemporary fungi resemble its ancestors, dating back over a million years ago. For example, “In the Dominican amber, a mosquito was found with several types of parasitic fungi growing on its outside cuticle. What is interesting is that the fungi resemble modern day fungi in class Trichomycetes, which are common gut-inhabiting zygomycetes of insects, but they differ from Trichomycetes in that the fungi are on the outside of the insect rather than the inside.” The study of ancient fungi can be used to track the evolution of fungi through millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodge|first=Kathie|title=Paleomycology: Discovering the fungal contemporaries of dinosaurs|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2009/05/13/paleomycology-discovering-the-fungal-contemporaries-of-dinosaurs/|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Osteology in Archaeology==
The study of [[osteology]] is a study of bones and can be a subdiscipline in archeology. Osteologists in archeology reconstruct bones of humans or animals from the past to find more about the past civilizations. . Osteology is used in archaeology to determine the age, gender, and ethnicity of the remains.  It is also helpful to rebuild past societies’ cultural background. Using the remains from the past can help modern archaeologist uncover the past from what they ate to their daily activities. This can help uncover the mysteries of past histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackinnon|first=Michael|title=Osteological Research in Classical Archaeology|journal=State of the Discipline|date=July 2007|pages=1|url=http://www.ajaonline.org/sites/default/files/1113_MacKinnon.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''Atheist's Wager''', popularised by the philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] and published in his 1990 book ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'', is an [[Atheism|atheistic]] response to [[Pascal's Wager]] regarding the [[existence of God]].

One version of the Atheist's Wager suggests that since a kind and loving god would reward good deeds –&amp;nbsp;and that if no gods exist, good deeds would still leave a positive legacy&amp;nbsp;– one should live a good life without religion.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Michael |title=Atheism: A Philosophical Justification |year=1990 |publisher=[[Temple University]] Press |pages=232–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqxSJcoZVKIC&amp;pg=PA11 |title=So What If...the God of the Bible Exists...Does It Really Matter at the End ... |page=10 |author=Alvin F Berry |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |isbn=9781457500206 |quote= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another formulation suggests that a god may reward honest disbelief and punish a dishonest belief in the divine.&lt;ref name="beginner"&gt;{{cite book |title=Atheism: A Beginner's Handbook: All You Wanted to Know About Atheism and Why |isbn=9780595427376 |author=Philip A Stahl}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The Wager states that if one were to analyze their options in regard to how to live their life, he or she would arrive at the following possibilities:&lt;ref name="martin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/theistic-proofs/pascals-wager/the-atheists-wager/ |title=The Atheists Wager |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MARPWA-2 |title=Pascal's Wager as an Argument for Not Believing in God |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*You may live a good life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite.
*You may live a good life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite.
*You may live a good life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite.
*You may live a good life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite.
*You may live an evil life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite.
*You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite.
*You may live an evil life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite.
*You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite.

The following table shows the values assigned to each possible outcome:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto"
|+ A benevolent god exists
|-
|
! Belief in god (B)
! No belief in god (¬B)
|-
! Good life (L)
| +∞ (heaven)
| +∞ (heaven)
|-
! Evil life (¬L)
| -∞ (hell)
| -∞ (hell)
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto"
|+ No benevolent god exists
|-
|
! Belief in god (B)
! No belief in god (¬B)
|-
! Good life (L)
| +X (positive legacy)
| +X (positive legacy)
|-
! Evil life (¬L)
| -X (negative legacy)
| -X (negative legacy)
|}

Given these values, Martin argues that the option to live a good life clearly [[dominance (game theory)|dominates]] the option of living an evil life, regardless of belief in a god.

==Biography==
Born in villa ''La Gracieuse'', [[Morges]], [[Switzerland]], to Victor Forel a pious Swiss Calvinist and Pauline Morin, a French Huguenot he was brought up under a protective household. At the age of seven he began to take an interest in insects. He went to school at Morges and Lausanne before joining the medical school at Zurich.  Forel had a diverse and mixed career as a thinker on many subjects. At Zurich he was inspired by the work of Bernhard  Aloys  von  Gudden  (1824-1886). In 1871 he went to Vienna and studied under Theodor  Meynert  (1833-1892) but was disappointed by Meynert. In 1873 he moved to Germany to assist Gudden at his Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt. He improved upon various techniques in neuro-anatomy including modifications to Gudden's microtome design. In 1877 he described the nuclear and fibrillar organization of the [[Ventral tegmental area|tegmental region]] which is now known as ''Campus Foreli.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parent|first=André|year=2003|title=Auguste Forel on Ants and Neurology|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/chn/docpdf/parent_forel.pdf|journal=Can. J. Neurol. Sci.|volume=30|pages=284–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a lecturer at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich while also continuing his researches on ants. His first major work was a 450 page treatise on the ants of Switzerland which was published in 1874 and commended by [[Charles Darwin]]. He was appointed professor of psychiatry in 1879 at the [[University of Zurich]] Medical School. He not only ran the [[Burghölzli]] asylum there, but continued to publish papers on [[insanity]], [[prison reform]], and [[morality|social morality]]. The asylum was very poorly run with corrupt staff and poor standards before Forel took over and converted to be among the best in Europe. Forel named his home as ''La Fourmilière'' —the Ant Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Sleigh, Charlotte (2007) Six legs better : a cultural history of myrmecology. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-8445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 Forel was a [[eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolan.com/hitler/survive.html The Survival of the Fittest, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; Forel suffered a [[stroke]] that paralyzed his right side in 1912, but he taught himself to write with his left hand and was able to continue his studies. By 1914 he was a good friend of the eminent [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entomologist]] [[Horace Donisthorpe]], with whom he stayed in [[Switzerland]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Entomologist's Record'', vol XXV, Nos 1-2 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; his ardent [[socialist]] views frequently caused political arguments between the two.

In 1921 he received a [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|letter from `Abdu'l-Bahá]] about the differences between the mineral, vegetable, animal and human worlds, the spiritual nature of man and proofs of the existence of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Paul |last=Vader |year=1984 |title=For the Good of Mankind - August Forel and the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-172-8 |pages=17–24, 70–80 |url= http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23998532M/For_the_Good_of_Mankind }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/abdul-baha/tablet-august-forel |title=‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Dr. Forel |publisher=reference.bahai.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an agnostic and was strongly anti-capitalist diverging from the Bahá’í religion of today.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00381-011-1659-7|title=August Forel (1848–1931): A look at his life and work|journal=Child's Nervous System|volume=28|pages=1|year=2011|last1=Osiro|first1=Stephen|last2=Gielecki|first2=Jerzy|last3=Matusz|first3=Petru|last4=Shoja|first4=Mohammadali M.|last5=Tubbs|first5=R.

Forel married Emma Steinheil in August 1883 and they had four daughters and two sons. In 1903 Forel and his family moved to live in his home, ''La Fourmiliere'', in [[Yvorne]] near Lake Geneva. He died there on July 27, 1931 and was cremated in Lausanne
two days later.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Scientific work==
[[File:Le Monde Social Des Fourmis.jpg|thumb|The Social World of Ants]]
Forel's prize essay on the ants of Switzerland was published in three parts in a Swiss scientific journal, beginning in 1874.  The work was reissued as a single volume in 1900, at which time it was also translated into English.  His myrmecological five-volume magnum opus, ''Le Monde Social des Fourmis'', was published in 1923.

Forel's predilection for finding in ants the analogs of human social and political behaviors was always controversial.  In the foreword to his 1927 edition of ''British Ants: their life history and classification'', Donisthorpe opined, "I should wish ... to protest against the ants being employed as a supposed weapon in political controversy. In my opinion an entomological work is not the appropriate means for the introduction of political theories of any kind, still less for their glaring advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;''British Ants: their life history and classification'', 2nd Edition (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;  But in 1937, the work was excerpted in Sir [[John Alexander Hammerton|J.A. Hammerton]]'s ''Outline of Great Books'' with praise for its relevance to the study of human psychology and as "the most important contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Hammerton, Outline of Great Books, New York, Wise &amp; Co. (1937), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

Forel realized from experiments that neurons were the basic elements of the nervous system. He found that the neuromuscular junction communicated by mere contact and did not require the anastomosis of fibres. This came to be called the ''Contact Theory of Forel''. The word "neuron" was coined by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm von Waldeyer]] who published  a review of the work of Forel and others in 1891. Waldeyer synthesized ideas without actually conducting any research himself and published it in ''Deutsche   medizinische Wochenschrift'' a widely read journal which made him popular. Forel was very bitter about Waldeyer's achievement of fame that it is thought to have contributed to the decline in his interest in neuroanatomy and neurology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Less controversially, Forel first described in 1877 the [[zona incerta]] area in the brain. He gave it this name as it a "region of which nothing certain can be said".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. | title = Untersuchungen über die Haubenregion und ihre oberen Verknüpfungen im Gehirne des Menschen und einiger Säugethiere, mit Beiträgen zu den Methoden der Gehirnuntersuchung | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten| last1 = Forel | volume = 7| issue = 3 | pages = 393–495 | year = 1877 | doi = 10.1007/BF02041873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Blue Sky Mine"''' is a song by Australian rock band [[Midnight Oil]] released in 1990 as the first single from their album ''[[Blue Sky Mining]]''. It peaked at No. 7 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' Top Singles]] chart, No. 8 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] and [[VG-lista|Norwegian Singles Chart]], No. 25 on the [[Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique|French Singles Chart]], No. 66 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], No. 47 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and No. 1 on both the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock]] charts. It charted the highest in New Zealand, where it reached No. 2 for two weeks behind "[[Don't Make Me Over (song)|Don't Make Me Over]]" by [[Sybil (singer)|Sybil]].

The song was inspired by the experiences of workers at the [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] [[asbestos]] mines who contracted various asbestos-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbestosdiseases.org.au/asbestosinfo/wittenoom_tragedies.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r13029|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/travel-tips-and-articles/76715&lt;/ref&gt; The "blue" refers to [[blue asbestos]], and the "sugar refining company" refers to the [[CSR Limited|Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd (CSR)]], the owner of the mines.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}

In [[human geography]], a '''catchment area''' is the area from which a city, service or institution attracts a population that uses its services. For example, a school catchment area is the [[geographic]] area from which students are eligible to attend a local [[school]].

Governments and [[community service]] organizations often define catchment areas for planning purposes and [[public safety]] such as ensuring universal access to services like fire departments, police departments, ambulance bases and hospitals.

==Creation==
Catchment areas are generally established and modified by local governments. These boundaries can be modeled using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLafferty |first1=Sara L. |title=GIS and Health Care |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=24 |issue= |pages=25–42 |year=2003 |pmid=12668754 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.24.012902.141012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be large variability in the services provided within different catchments in the same area depending upon how and when those catchments were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=C. |last2=Campbell |first2=J. |title=Catchment areas in general practice and their relation to size and quality of practice and deprivation: a descriptive study in one London borough |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7066 |pages=1189–92 |year=1996 |pmid=8916754 |pmc=2352502 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7066.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually contiguous but can overlap when they describe competing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=Nadine |last2=Fiedler |first2=Robert S |last3=Grzybowski |first3=Stefan CW |last4=Grund |first4=Darrin |title=Defining rational hospital catchments for non-urban areas based on travel-time |journal=International Journal of Health Geographics |volume=5 |issue= |pages=43 |year=2006 |pmid=17018146 |pmc=1617091 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-5-43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining===
Catchments can be defined based upon a number of factors including distance to the facility, actual travel time to the facility, geographic boundaries or population within the catchment.  In a distance based catchment, the area serviced will often depend on the number of visits expected to that institution by each individual.  For example, it may be more acceptable to have a larger catchment for a hospital where any one individual will have few annual visits in comparison to a school where visits will be daily and hence desired distance would be closer.  
When a facility’s capacity can only service a certain volume, the catchment may be used to limit a population’s ability to access services outside that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Eddie |last2=Chalkley |first2=Brian |last3=Jones |first3=Allan |title=School Catchments and Pupil Movements: A case study in parental choice |journal=Educational Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1080/03055690097727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, children may be unable to enroll in a school outside their catchment to prevent the school's services being exceeded.

*[[Airport]]s can be built and maintained in locations which minimize the driving distance for the surrounding population to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airports: Non-Financial Analysis |publisher=[[Transport Canada]] |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/airports/RSAS/nonfinanalysis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*A neighborhood or district of a city often has several small convenience shops, each with a catchment area of several streets.  Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with catchment areas of several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas).  This principle, similar to the [[central place theory]], makes catchment areas an important area of study for [[geographers]], [[economists]], and [[urban planners]].
*In Nigeria, most Federal Schools respect the fact that some states are educationally less developed than others. The country's higher education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admission: University Admission |publisher=Students Nigeria |url=https://www.students.com.ng/category/admission }}&lt;/ref&gt; catchment areas have therefore been designed to ensure a good mixture of students from different backgrounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21591">'''Computational biology''' involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih" /&gt; The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[biology]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[genomics]], [[computer science]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;

Computational biology is different from [[biological computing]], which is a subfield of [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]] using [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, but is similar to [[bioinformatics]], which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.

==Introduction==
Computational Biology, which includes many aspects of [[bioinformatics]], is the science of using biological data to develop [[algorithms]] or [[Computational modeling|models]] to understand biological systems and relationships. 
Until recently, biologists did not have access to very large amounts of data. This data has now become commonplace, particularly in [[molecular biology]] and [[genomics]]. Researchers were able to develop analytical methods for interpreting biological information, but were unable to share them quickly among colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogeweg|first=Paulien|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in Theoretical Biology|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=7 March 2011|volume=7|issue=3|series=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002021|pages=e1002021|pmid=21483479|pmc=3068925}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Bioinformatics began to develop in the early 1970s. It was considered the science of analyzing informatics processes of various biological systems. At this time, research in [[artificial intelligence]] was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new [[algorithms]]. This use of biological data to develop other fields pushed biological researchers to revisit the idea of using computers to evaluate and compare large data sets. By 1982, information was being shared among researchers through the use of punch cards. The amount of data being shared began to grow exponentially by the end of the 1980s. This required the development of new computational methods in order to quickly analyze and interpret relevant information.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;
      
Since the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Philip|title=Rise and Demise of Bioinformatics? Promise and Progress|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002487|volume=8|issue=4|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|pages=e1002487|pmid=22570600|pmc=3343106|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms computational biology and [[evolutionary computation]] have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as [[genetic algorithm]]s, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, Computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=James|title=Evolutionary Computation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=2|issue=6|pages=428–436|date=June 2001|doi=10.1038/35076523|pmid=11389459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational biology has been used to help sequence the human genome, create accurate models of the human brain, and assist in modeling biological systems.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;

==Subfields==

===Computational anatomy===
{{main|Computational anatomy}}
Computational anatomy is a discipline focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] &lt;math&gt; 50-100 \mu &lt;/math&gt; 
scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. It involves the development and application of computational, mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulation of biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D.

The original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q. Appl. Math. |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=617–694 |date = 1998-12-01 |first = Ulf|last = Grenander|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] from one anatomical configuration in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; to another. It relates with [[shape statistics]] and [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that [[diffeomorphism]]s are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.

===Computational biomodeling===
{{main|Modelling biological systems}}
Computational biomodeling is a field concerned with building [[computer model]]s of biological systems. Computational biomodeling aims to develop and use visual simulations in order to assess the complexity of biological systems. This is accomplished through the use of specialized algorithms, and visualization software. These models allow for prediction of how systems will react under different environments. This is useful for determining if a system is robust. A robust biological system is one that “maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations”,&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|title=Computational systems biology|journal=Nature|date=14 November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=206–10|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/204483859/abstract?accountid=6167|doi=10.1038/nature01254|pmid=12432404}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essential for a biological system to survive. Computational biomodeling generates a large archive of such data, allowing for analysis from multiple users. While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe that this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy.&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"/&gt;
A useful modelling approach is to use [[Petri nets]] via tools such as esyN &lt;ref name="Bean 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favrin|first=Bean|title=esyN: Network Building, Sharing and Publishing.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2 September 2014|pmid=25181461|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0106035|volume=9|issue=9|pmc=4152123|pages=e106035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational genomics (Computational genetics)===
[[File:Genome viewer screenshot small.png|thumbnail|right|A partially sequenced genome.]]
{{main|Computational genomics}}
Computational genomics is a field within [[genomics]] which studies the [[genome]]s of cells and organisms. It is sometimes referred to as [[Computational and Statistical Genetics]] and encompasses much of [[Bioinformatics]]. The [[Human Genome Project]] is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genome Sequencing to the Rest of Us|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=personal-genome-sequencing|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual’s pre-existing genetic patterns. This project has created many similar programs. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene|title=Computational Genomics|date=6 March 2001|volume=11|issue=5|pages=155–158|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201000811|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00081-1|pmid=11267880|journal=Curr. Biol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main ways that genomes are compared is by [[sequence homology]]. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"/&gt;

This field is still in development. An untouched project in the development of computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions. Studies show that roughly 97% of the human genome consists of these regions.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158" /&gt; Researchers in computational genomics are working on understanding the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as [[ENCODE]] (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.

===Computational neuroscience===
{{main|Computational neuroscience}}
Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. It is a subset of the field of neuroscience, and looks to analyze brain data to create practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BU Neuroscience|url=http://www.bu.edu/neuro/graduate/computational-neuroscience/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It looks to model the brain in order to examine specific types aspects of the neurological system. Various types of models of the brain include:
* Realistic Brain Models: These models look to represent every aspect of the brain, including as much detail at the cellular level as possible. Realistic models provide the most information about the brain, but also have the largest margin for error. More variables in a brain model create the possibility for more error to occur. These models do not account for parts of the cellular structure that scientists do not know about. Realistic brain models are the most computationally heavy and the most expensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sejnowski|first=Terrence |author2=Christof Koch |author3=Patricia S. Churchland|title=Computational Neuroscience|date=9 September 1988|volume=241|series=4871}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplifying Brain Models:  These models look to limit the scope of a model in order to assess a specific physical property of the neurological system. This allows for the intensive computational problems to be solved, and reduces the amount of potential error from a realistic brain model.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"/&gt;
It is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the [[algorithms]] and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.

===Computational pharmacology===
Computational pharmacology (from a computational biology perspective) is “the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then [[drug discovery|screening drug data]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Michael|title=Computational Biologists: The Next Pharma Scientists?|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2012_04_13/caredit.a1200041|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pharmaceutical industry]] requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jessen|first=Walter|title=Pharma's shifting strategy means more jobs for computational biologists|url=http://medcitynews.com/2012/04/pharmas-shifting-strategy-means-more-jobs-for-computational-biologists/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;

===Computational evolutionary biology===
Computational biology has assisted the field of evolutionary biology in many capacities. This includes:
* Using DNA data to reconstruct the tree of life with [[computational phylogenetics]]
* Fitting [[population genetics]] models (either forward time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time|journal=Current Genomics|author = Antonio Carvajal-Rodríguez|year = 2012|pmc=2851118|volume=11|issue=1|pages=58–61|doi=10.2174/138920210790218007|pmid=20808525}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coalescent theory|backward time]]) to DNA data to make inferences about [[population growth|demographic]] or [[natural selection|selective]] history
* Building [[population genetics]] models of evolutionary systems from first principles in order to predict what is likely to evolve.

===Cancer computational biology===
Cancer computational biology is a field that aims to determine the future mutations in cancer through an algorithmic approach to analyzing data. Research in this field has led to the use of high-throughput measurement. High throughput measurement allows for the gathering of millions of data points using robotics and other sensing devices. This data is collected from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures. Areas of focus include determining the characteristics of tumors, analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer, and understanding how the human genome relates to the causation of tumors and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakhini|first=Zohar|title=Cancer Computational Biology|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|pages=120|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/120|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-120|pmid=21521513|pmc=3111371|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational neuropsychiatry===
Computational neuropsychiatry is the emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. It was already demonstrated by several initiatives that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;Dauvermann, Maria R., Heather C. Whalley, André Schmidt, Graham L. Lee, Liana Romaniuk, Neil Roberts, Eve C. Johnstone, Stephen M. Lawrie, and Thomas WJ Moorhead. "Computational neuropsychiatry–schizophrenia as a cognitive brain network disorder." Frontiers in psychiatry 5 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tretter, Felix, and M. Albus. "“Computational Neuropsychiatry” of Working Memory Disorders in Schizophrenia: The Network Connectivity in Prefrontal Cortex-Data and Models." Pharmacopsychiatry 40, no. S 1 (2007): S2-S16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin-Sanguino, A., and E. R. Mendoza. "Hybrid modeling in computational neuropsychiatry." Pharmacopsychiatry 41, no. S 01 (2008): S85-S88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and tools==
Computational Biologists use a wide range of software. These range from command line programs to graphical and web-based programs.

===Open source software===
[[Open source software]] provides a platform to develop computational biological methods. Specifically, open source means that every person and/or entity can access and benefit from software developed in research. [[PLOS]] cites four main reasons for the use of open source software including:
*[[Reproducibility]]: This allows for researchers to use the exact methods used to calculate the relations between biological data.
*Faster Development: developers and researchers do not have to reinvent existing code for minor tasks. Instead they can use pre-existing programs to save time on the development and implementation of larger projects.
* Increased quality: Having input from multiple researchers studying the same topic provides a layer of assurance that errors will not be in the code.
*Long-term availability: Open source programs are not tied to any businesses or patents. This allows for them to be posted to multiple web pages and ensure that they are available in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS Computational Biology| doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002799 | volume=8| issue=11 |title=The PLOS Computational Biology Software Section|pages=e1002799|year=2012|last1=Prlić|first1=Andreas| last2=Lapp | first2=Hilmar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
There are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB), [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) and [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB).

==Journals==

There are numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include [[Journal of Computational Biology]] and [[PLOS Computational Biology]]. The PLOS computational biology journal is a peer-reviewed journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences. [[PLOS Computational Biology]] is an [[open access journal]]. The publication may be openly used provided the author is cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLOS Computational Biology|url=http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a new open access journal [http://biopublisher.ca/index.php/cmb Computational Molecular Biology] was launched.

==Related fields==

Computational biology, [[bioinformatics]] and [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and [[information science]]. The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

Specifically, the NIH defines

{{quote|Computational biology: The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Bioinformatics: Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

While each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

'''Davender S. Malik''' is an Indian American mathematician and professor of mathematics and [[computer science]] at [[Creighton University]].

==Education==
Malik attended the [[University of Delhi]] in [[New Delhi]], [[India]], receiving his bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics, where he won the Prof. Ram Behari Gold Medal in 1980 for his high marks.&lt;ref name=indiawest&gt;{{cite news | title=Davender Malik Named for New Chair in Creighton Mathematics | work=India-West | date=24 November 2013 | url=http://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/davender-malik-named-for-new-chair-in-creighton-mathematics/article_f2f3434e-e461-5546-9b46-9b0b017872a3.html?mode=jqm | accessdate=29 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Fulvia Furinghetti | title=The First Century of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (1908-2008): Ram Behari | work=[[International Commission on Mathematical Instruction|ICMI]] | publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Genova | url=http://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/behari.php | accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, he received a master's degree in [[pure mathematics]].&lt;ref name=indiawest/&gt;  In the [[United States]], Malik went to [[Ohio University]], earning an M.S. in [[computer science]], and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1985, writing his dissertation on "A Study of Q-Hypercyclic Rings."&lt;ref name=indiawest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A study of q-hypercyclic rings | work=ALICE Catalog | publisher=Ohio University Libraries | url=http://alice.library.ohiou.edu/record=b1485010~S7 | accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

'''Expressionist architecture''' is an architectural movement in Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in [[Germany]]. [[Brick Expressionism]] is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in [[The Netherlands]] ([[Amsterdam School]]). Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of [[Modern architecture]] ([[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], Expressionist- and [[Constructivist architecture]]).

==In the 1920s==

The term "Expressionist architecture" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stallybrass and Bullock, p.301–392 – entry by John Willett&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate.

Important events in expressionist architecture include; the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)]] in [[Cologne]], the completion and theatrical running of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]], Berlin in 1919, the [[Glass Chain]] letters, and the activities of the [[Amsterdam School]]. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]]. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably [[Hans Scharoun]], continued to work in an expressionist idiom.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"&gt;Pehnt, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"/&gt; Until the 1970s scholars&lt;ref&gt;Most notably [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later [[International style (architecture)|International style]], but this has been re-evaluated in recent years.

==Characteristics==

Expressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.166&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works.

#Distortion of form for an emotional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Taut, Die Stadtkrone 1919 p.87, quote ''"Architecture is art and ought to be the highest of the arts. It consists exclusively of powerful emotion and addresses itself exclusively to the emotions."''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Subordination of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.
#An underlying effort at achieving the new, original, and visionary.
#Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of [[concept]]s more important than pragmatic finished products.
#Often hybrid solutions, irreducible to a single concept.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"&gt;Pehnt, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
#Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.19, Taut's mention of ''"earth-crust architecture"'' and what Poelzig deemed, ''"Important to remodel the earth's surface sculpturally."''&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary [[art nouveau]].
#Uses creative potential of [[artisan]] [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].
#Tendency more towards the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] than the [[Classical architecture|classical]]. Expressionist architecture also tends more towards the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] and the [[rococo]] than the classical.
#Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as [[Eastern world|eastern]] as [[western world|western]]. It draws as much from [[Moorish]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], and [[Indian architecture|Indian]] art and architecture as from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] or [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
#Conception of architecture as a work of art.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"/&gt;

==Context==

[[File:Taut Glass Pavilion exterior 1914.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Glass Pavilion]] at the [[Cologne]] [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition]], 1914 ([[Bruno Taut]])]]

Political, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the [[Weimar republic]] created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar [[October Revolution|revolution]] as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"&gt;Pehnt, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic movements that preceded expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the [[arts and crafts movement]] and [[art nouveau]] or in Germany, [[jugendstil]]. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in art nouveau, which was also prevalent in [[romanticism]], continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist, [[Ernst Haeckel]] was known by Finsterlin&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms.

The [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] architectural movements, and the [[dada]] anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, ''Frülicht'' included constructivist projects, including [[Vladimir Tatlin]]s ''Monument to the Third International''.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"&gt;Sharp, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; and urbanism&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist [[Antonio Sant'Elia]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.119"&gt;Pehnt, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Merzbau'' by Dada artist [[Kurt Schwitters]], with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.

Influence of individualists such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] also provided the surrounding context for expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudí was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of art nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of art nouveau than that of say Bruno Taut. The circle of der Ring, did know about Gaudí, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly arts and crafts or art nouveau, buildings such as the [[Hill House, Helensburgh|Hill House]] and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the [[Vienna Secession]] exhibition in 1900.

==Underlying ideas==

Many writers contributed to the ideology of expressionist architecture. Sources of [[philosophy]] important to expressionist architects were works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"&gt;Pehnt, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; particularly ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"/&gt; Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's ''Alpine Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Franz Kafka]] in his ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', with its shape shifting matched the material instability of expressionist architecture&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists such as [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Ernst Haeckel]] contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet [[Paul Scheerbart]] worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture.

Emergent [[psychology]] from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] was important to expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and space&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"&gt;Pehnt, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that, "Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt; The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of [[aesthetics]] had been developing, particularly through the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Schopenhauer]] and notions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the "science of art", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the Zeitschift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst "the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic theories of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], such as ''[[Concerning the Spiritual in Art]]'', and ''Point and Line to Plane'' were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"&gt;Sharp, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

A recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it [[monolith]]ic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future.&lt;ref&gt;Benson p.100&lt;/ref&gt; They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.
:''"Coloured glass destroys hatred","Without a glass palace life is a burden","Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm"'' – Paul Scheerbart, inscriptions on the 1914 Werkbund Glass Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"/&gt;
Another example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the towers namesake, ''Einstein'', and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, ''Ein stein''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.

Brick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. [[Josef Franke]] produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin Housing Estate "Legien-Stadt". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt ''"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick"''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the international style.

==Theatres, films, paintings and magazines==

[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of expressionist architecture in the film set for ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.]]

Europe witnessed a boom in [[Theatre|theatrical]] production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; [[Film|Cinema]] witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt;

Many architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for [[German Expressionism|expressionist films]]. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the [[performing arts]] held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor.

Built examples of expressionist theatres include [[Henry van de Velde]]'s construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and [[Hans Poelzig]]'s grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Grosses Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a "people's theatre".&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, ''Weltbaumeister''.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt;

Expressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on [[legend]]s or [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"&gt;Pehnt, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Poelzig designed scenographic sets for [[Paul Wegener]]'s 1920 film ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem]]''. Space in ''Der Golem'' was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the ''Cabinet of Doctor Caligari'', which was painted on canvas backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in ''Der Golem'' was able to create a whole village that "spoke with a Jewish accent."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"/&gt;

Herman Finsterlin approached [[Fritz Lang]] with an idea for a film.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Fritz Lang's film [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]] demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled ''Die Galoschen des Glücks''(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. On the film, Taut noted, "an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Taut, ''Die Gläserne Kette'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt; It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Abstraction==

The tendency towards abstraction in art corresponded with abstraction in architecture. Publication of ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art'' in 1912 by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in [[Der Blaue Reiter]] phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"/&gt; The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's ''Point and Line to Plane'' in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.

==Brick Expressionism==
{{main|Brick Expressionism}}
[[File:Chilehaus - Hamburg.jpg|thumb|235px|[[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]], 1923 ([[Fritz Höger]]) ]]
The term '''Brick Expressionism''' ({{lang-de|Backsteinexpressionismus}}) describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s or [[clinker brick]]s as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Ruhr area]], but the [[Amsterdam School]] belongs to the same category.

Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial [[Scheepvaarthuis]] (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925.

The great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups "[[Die Brücke]]" in [[Dresden]] since 1905 ([[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff|Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]],...) and "[[Der Blaue Reiter]]" in [[Munich]] since 1912 ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc|Marc]], [[August Macke|Macke]], [[Gabriele Münter|Münter]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky|Jawlensky]],...).

==Legacy==

The legacy of expressionist architecture extended to later movements in the twentieth century. It had an influence on its immediate successor, modern architecture, as well as Art Deco. The [[New Objectivity|new objectivity]] (''Neue Sachlichkeit'') art movement arose in direct opposition to expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in [[deconstructivism]], the work of [[Santiago Calatrava]], and the organic movement of [[blobitecture]].

Another movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is [[Metaphoric architecture]] which includes elements of [[biomorphism]] and [[Zoomorphic architecture]].  The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.&lt;ref name=metaphor&gt;

Many of the founders and significant players in expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.

===Art Deco===
{{Main|Art Deco}}
First identified at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] in 1925, [[art deco]] shares some characteristics of expressionism and is likely to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement – particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus – and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with [[art nouveau]] and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. Later examples of Art Deco, particularly in [[New York City]] can be seen as a Transatlantic equivalent of European expressionism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Expressionism since the 1950s===
The influential architectural critic and historian, [[Sigfried Giedion]] in his book ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism [[brutalist architecture|brutalism]] had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of [[Le Corbusier]] took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his [[Notre Dame du Haut]]. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré [[Mathias Goeritz]], published the "Arquitectura Emocional" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that "architecture's principal function is emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Goeritz, "El manifiesto de arquitectura emocional", in Lily Kassner, Mathias Goeritz, UNAM, 2007, p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mexican architect [[Luis Barragán]] adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project [[Torres de Satélite]] (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was [[Eero Saarinen]]. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as [[Eero Saarinen]]'s 1962 [[TWA Flight Center|TWA Terminal]] at [[JFK International Airport]]. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's ''Formspiels'' as any other, save [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]]. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently{{when|date=January 2011}} still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of [[Enric Miralles]], most notability his [[Scottish Parliament building]], [[deconstructivist]] architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]], as well as [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] architect [[Douglas Cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001394|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|title=The Canada Council for the Arts|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203103759/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===[[1900 in architecture|1900]]===

*Reactions to [[Art Nouveau]] impelled partly by moral yearnings for a sterner and more unadorned style and in part by rationalist ideas requiring practical justification for formal effects.

*November – [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] (Worker's Council for the Arts), founded by [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Adolf Behne]]. They model themselves consciously on the Soviets and attach a leftist programme to their Utopian and Expressionist activities. They demand; 1. A spiritual revolution to accompany the political one. 2. Architects to form ‘Corporations’ bound by ‘mutual aid’.
*November – [[Novembergruppe]] formed only to merge with [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] the following month. It proclaims; 1. Creation of collective art works. 2. Mass housing. 3. The destruction of artistically valueless monuments (This was a common reaction of the Avant Garde against the elitist militarism that was perceived as the cause of World War I).
*December – [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] declares its basic aims in [[Bruno Taut]]s ''Architeckturprogramm''. It calls for a new 'total work of art', to be created with active participation of the people.
*Bruno Taut publishes [[Die Stadtkrone]].

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1919 in architecture|1919]]&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vorgeschichte feininger.jpg|thumb|Woodblock 'Cathedral by [[Lyonel Feininger]], used as front cover for the 1919 [[Bauhaus]] manifesto]] --&gt;
*Spring manifesto of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] is published. Art for the masses. Alliance of the arts under the wing of architecture. 50 artists, architects and patrons join led by [[Bruno Taut]], [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Adolf Behne]].
*April – [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Bernard Hoetger]], [[Max Taut]] and [[Otto Bartning]] stage exhibition called 'An Exhibition of Unknown Architects'. [[Walter Gropius]] writes the introduction, now considered to be a first draft for the [[Bauhaus]] programme published later in the month. Called for a ‘Cathedral of the Future’, to unify the creative energy of society as in the Middle Ages.
*[[Bauhaus]] established and begins expressionist phase, to last until 1923.
*[[Adolf Behne]] publishes ''Ja! Stimmen des Arbeitsrates für Kunst in Berlin'' (''Yes! Voices from the art Soviet in Berlin'').
*[[Spartacist revolt]] ends the overt activities of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]]. The group starts the first [[Utopian]] letter of the [[Glass Chain]] by Bruno Taut. They are joined by previously peripheral architects; [[Hans Luckhardt]], [[Wassili Luckhardt]] and [[Hans Scharoun]]. The letters demand; 1. Return to medieval integration of the building team. 2. Irregular form. 3. Facetted form. 4. Glass monuments.
*Opening of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]] by Hans Poelzig in Berlin. Hanging pendentive forms create a ‘luminous dissolution of form and space’.
*[[Bruno Taut]] launches the magazine [[Frühlicht]] (Early Light).
*[[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Scharoun]] stress the creative importance of the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].

===[[1920 in architecture|1920]]===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Friedrichstrasse Mies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s Friedrichstraße Skyscraper Project, Berlin-Mitte, 1921]] --&gt;
*February 26, the film [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] premiered at the [[Marmorhaus]] in Berlin.
*[[Hans Poelzig]] declares affinity with the Glass Chain. He designs sets for [[The Golem: How He Came Into the World|The Golem]].
*Solidarity of the Glass Chain is broken. Final letter written by [[Hermann Finsterlin]]. Hans Luckhardt recognises the incompatibility of free unconscious form and rationalist prefabrication and moves to [[Rationalism]].
*Taut maintains his Scheerbartian views. He publishes ‘Die Auflösung der Städt' (The dissolution of the city) in line with [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]ian anarchist socialist tendencies. In common with the [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s, it recommends the breakup of cities and a return to the land. He models agrarian communities and temples in the Alps. There would be 3 separate residential communities. 1. The enlightened. 2. Artists. 3. Children. This authoritarianism is noted in Frampton as although socialist in intent, paradoxically containing the seeds of the later fascism.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1921 in architecture|1921]]&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Amsterdam PL Tak Complex.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Amsterdam]], [[Plan Zuid]], PL-Takstraat, 1923. "Amsterdam, Mecca of Social Housing" ]]
*Taut is made city architect of [[Magdeburg]] and fails to realise a municipal exhibition hall as the harsh economic realities of the [[Weimar republic]] become apparent and prospects of building a ‘glass paradise’ dwindle.
*[[Walter Gropius]] designs the ''Monument to the March Dead''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/1526381043320796;jsessionid=n_5xJRMLsgMegIOfxT] in [[Weimar]]. It is completed in 1922 and inspires the workers' gong in the 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' by [[Fritz Lang]].
*[[Frülicht]] loses its impetus.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]] visits works of the Dutch [[Wendingen]] group and tours the Netherlands. He meets the rationalists [[Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud|JJP Oud]] and [[W M Dudek]]. He recognises the conflict of visionary and objective approaches to design.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Mossehaus]] opens. Construction is complete on the [[Einstein Tower]]. It combines the sculptural forms of Van de Weldes Werkbund Exhibition theatre with the profile of Taut's Glashaus and the formal affinity to vernacular Dutch architecture of [[Eibink]] and [[Jan Snellebrand|Snellebrand]] and [[Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld|Hendrikus Wijdeveld]]. Einstein himself visits and declares it ‘organic’.
*Mendelsohn designs a hat factory in [[Luckenwalde]]. It shows influences of the Dutch expressionist [[De Klerk]], setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements. This approach is echoed in his [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] textile mill of 1925 and anticipates the banding in his department stores in [[Breslau]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Chemnitz]] and Berlin from 1927 and 1931.
*[[Hugo Häring]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] submit a competition entry for a Friedrichstrasse office building. It reveals an organic approach to structure and is fully made of glass.

*[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] publishes a glass skyscraper project in the last issue of [[Frülicht]].
*[[Toompea Castle]] is rebuilt for the [[Riigikogu]] in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], as the only expressionist style parliamentary building in the world.
*The film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' by [[F.W. Murnau]] is released.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1923 in architecture|1923]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Bauhaus]] expressionist phase ends. Standard arguments for the reasons for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. Rampant inflation in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the [[Zeitgeist]]. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, [[Johannes Itten]], to be replaced with the, then constructivist, [[László Moholy-Nagy]].
*[[Chilehaus]] in Hamburg by [[Fritz Höger]].
*[[Walter Gropius]] abandons expressionism and moves to rationalism.
*Bruno and Max Taut begin work on government funded low cost housing projects.
*[[Berlin secession exhibition]]. Mies van der Rohe and Hans and Wassili Luckhardt demonstrate a more functional and objective approach.
*[[Rudolf Steiner]] designs second [[Goetheanum]] after first was destroyed by fire in 1922. Work commences 1924 and is completed in 1928.

*[[Hugo Häring]] designs a farm complex. It uses expressive pitched roofs contrasted with bulky tectonic elements and rounded corners.
*[[Hugo Häring]] designs [[Prinz Albrecht Garten]], residential project. Whilst demonstrating overt expressionism he is preoccupied with deeper inquiries into the inner source of form.
*Foundation of [[Zehnerring]] group.

*[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) convenes in Switzerland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">A '''functional response''' in [[ecology]] is the intake rate of a [[heterotroph|consumer]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of [[food density]] (the amount of food available in a given [[ecotope]]). It is associated with the [[numerical response]], which is the [[reproduction]] rate of a consumer as a function of food density. Following [[C. S. Holling]], functional responses are generally classified into three types, which are called Holling's type I, II, and III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Holling |first1=C. S. |title=The components of [[predation]] as revealed by a study of small-[[mammal]] predation of the European pine sawfly |journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=91 |issue=5 |date=May 1959 |pages=293–320 |doi=10.4039/Ent91293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FunctionalResponsesGraph.svg|thumb|300px|right|Types I, II, and III functional responses]]

== Type I ==

Type I functional response assumes a linear increase in intake rate with food density, either for all food densities, or only for food densities up to a maximum, beyond which the intake rate is constant. The linear increase assumes that the time needed by the consumer to process a food item is negligible, or that consuming food does not interfere with searching for food. A functional response of type I is used in the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra]] predator–prey model. It was the first kind of functional response described and is also the simplest of the three functional responses currently detailed.

== Type II ==

Type II functional response is characterized by a decelerating intake rate, which follows from the assumption that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food. Type II functional response is often modeled by a [[rectangular hyperbola]], for instance as by Holling's disc equation,&lt;ref name="Holling59b"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Holling|first1=C. S.|title=Some characteristics of simple types of predation and parasitism|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=91|issue=7| date=July 1959 |pages=385&amp;ndash;98|doi=10.4039/Ent91385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive behaviors. The equation is
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
f(R) &amp;= \frac{a R}{1 + a h R}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Wolves killing caribou.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''Wolves killing Caribou'', by [[Arthur Robert Harding]], 1909. If the number of [[wolf|wolves]] is held constant, the number of [[caribou]] killed increases, then levels off.&lt;ref name=Dale1994/&gt;]]

where ''f'' denotes intake rate and ''R'' denotes food (or resource) density. The rate at which the consumer encounters food items per unit of food density is called the attack rate, ''a''. The average time spent on processing a food item is called the handling time, ''h''. Similar equations are the [[Monod equation]] for the growth of [[microorganism]]s and the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]] for the rate of enzymatic reactions. 

In an example with [[wolves]] and [[caribou]], as the number of caribou increases while holding wolves constant, the number of caribou kills increases and then levels off. This is because the proportion of caribou killed per wolf decreases as caribou density increases. The higher the density of caribou, the smaller the proportion of caribou killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, at very high caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and the total number of caribou kills reaches a plateau.&lt;ref name=Dale1994&gt;{{cite article |last1=Dale |first1=Bruce W. |first2=Layne G. |last2=Adams |first3=R. Terry |last3=Bowyer |title=Functional Response of Wolves Preying on Barren-Ground Caribou in a Multiple-Prey Ecosystem |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=63 |year=1994 |pages=644–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type III ==
Type III functional response is similar to type II in that at high levels of prey density, saturation occurs.  But now, at low prey density levels, the graphical relationship of number of prey consumed and the density of the prey population is a more than linearly increasing function of prey consumed by predators.  This accelerating function is largely descriptive, and often justified by learning time, prey switching, or a combination of both phenomena, but the type III functional response lacks the rigorous theoretical underpinning of the type II functional response. 

Learning time is defined as the natural improvement of a predator’s searching and attacking efficiency or the natural improvement in their handling efficiency as prey density increases.  Imagine a prey density so small that the chance of a predator encountering that prey is extremely low.  Because the predator finds prey so infrequently, it has not had enough experience to develop the best ways to capture and subdue that species of prey.  Holling identified this mechanism in [[shrews]] and [[deer mice]] feeding on [[sawflies]].  At low numbers of sawfly cocoons per acre, deer mice especially experienced exponential growth in terms of the number of cocoons consumed per individual as the density of cocoons increased.  The characteristic saturation point of the type III functional response was also observed in the deer mice.  At a certain density of cocoons per acre, the consumption rate of the deer mice reached a saturation amount as the cocoon density continued to increase.&lt;ref name="Holling59b"/&gt;

Prey switching involves two or more prey species and one predator species.  When all prey species are at equal prey densities, the predator will indiscriminately select between prey species.  However, if the density of one of the prey species decreases, then the predator will start selecting the other, more common prey species with a higher frequency.  Murdoch demonstrated this effect with [[guppy]] preying on tubificids and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. As fruit fly numbers decreased guppies switched from feeding on the fruit flies on the water’s surface to feeding on the more abundant tubificids along the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Murdoch|first1=William W.|title=Stabilizing effects of spatial heterogeneity in predator-prey systems|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=11|year=1977|pages=252&amp;ndash;73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Hydroinformatics''' is a branch of [[Information science|informatics]] which concentrates on the application of [[information technology|information and communications technologies]] (ICTs) in addressing the increasingly serious problems of the equitable and efficient use of [[water]] for many different purposes. Growing out of the earlier discipline of [[computational hydraulics]], the numerical [[simulation]] of water flows and related processes remains a mainstay of hydroinformatics, which encourages a focus not only on the technology but on its application in a social context. 

On the technical side, in addition to [[computational hydraulics]], hydroinformatics has a strong interest in the use of techniques originating in the so-called [[artificial intelligence]] community, such as [[artificial neural networks]] or recently [[support vector machines]] and [[genetic programming]]. These might be used with large collections of observed data for the purpose of [[data mining]] for knowledge discovery, or with data generated from an existing, physically based model in order to generate a computationally efficient emulator of that model for some purpose.

Hydroinformatics recognises the inherently social nature of the problems of water management and of decision making processes, and strives to understand the social processes by which technologies are brought into use. Since the problems of water management are most severe in the majority world, while the resources to obtain and develop technological solutions are concentrated in the hands of the minority, the need to examine these social processes are particularly acute.

Hydroinformatics draws on and integrates [[hydraulics]], [[hydrology]], [[environmental engineering]] and many other disciplines. It sees application at all points in the [[water cycle]] from atmosphere to ocean, and in artificial interventions in that cycle such as urban drainage and water supply systems. It provides support for decision making at all levels from governance and policy through management to operations.

Hydroinformatics has a growing world-wide community of researchers and practitioners, and postgraduate programmes in Hydroinformatics are offered by many leading institutions. The [[Journal of Hydroinformatics]] provides a specific outlet for Hydroinformatics research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/toc.htm IWA Publishing - Journal of Hydroinformatics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the community gathers to exchange ideas at the biennial conferences. These activities are coordinated by the joint [[IAHR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iahr.org/ International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Water Association|IWA]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwa-network.org/ IWA HomePage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Association of Hydrological Sciences|IAHS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://iahs.info/ IAHS-AISH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.iwahq.org/Home/Networks/Specialist_groups/List_of_groups/Hydroinformatics/ Hydroinformatics Section].

There is a growing need for professionals and managers to appreciate and work with these new technologies and tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2744">'''Hypsos''' is a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept comparable to the modern concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], or a moment that brings oral [[speech]] to an astonishing and monumental pause.  Its [[Word root|root]] ''hypso-'' literally means "aloft", "height", or "on high". However, a distinguishing feature of hypsos in [[rhetoric]]al studies is that it “combines conflicting [[emotion]]s: fear and [[awe]], [[wikt:Special:Search/horror|horror]] and fascinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;” It is a [[Climax (rhetoric)|climactic]] moment in speech that generates uncertainty for the audience.

==Longinus and hypsos==
The ancient Greek rhetoric teacher [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] introduced the concept of hypsos in the only significant piece of literature that he is known for having written during his lifetime, ''[[On the Sublime#The Treatise On the Sublime|On the Sublime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longinus|first=Cassius|title=Longinus On the Sublime|year=1867|publisher=T. &amp; G. Shrimpton|location=The University of Michigan|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. In his work, Longinus prompted the possibilities and freedom that [[speech]] could possess by presenting hypsos. Longinus’ theories and concepts differed greatly from other Greek rhetoricians and [[philosopher]]s, and challenged the traditional rigid structure of rhetorical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Gorman|first=Ned|title=Longinus's Sublime Rhetoric, or How Rhetoric Game into Its Own|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|year=2004|issue=34.2|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term effects of hypsos==
Hypsos is studied by present-day [[rhetorician]]s, and is often referred to through the publication of ''Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus: [[On the Sublime|Peri Hupsous]] in Rhetoric, the [[Visual Arts]], Architecture, and the Theatre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a collection of volumes of Longinus’ [[essay]]s. It stands as one of few pieces that explore the ways in which hypsos (which Longinus refers to as “the sublime in one single thought”) is used not only in rhetoric and literature, but also in the visual arts, architecture, and theater.

{{Disability}}
'''Inclusion''', in [[education]] refers to the a model wherein [[special needs]] students spend most or all of their time with non-special (general education) needs students.  It arises in the context of special education with an [[individualized education program]] or [[504 plan]], and is built on the notion that it is more effective for students with special needs to have said mixed experience for them to be more successful in social interactions leading to further success in life.  Inclusion rejects but still provides the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities. Schools with inclusive classrooms do not believe in separate classrooms. They do not have their own separate world so they have to learn how to operate with students while being less focused on by teachers due to a higher student to teacher ratio.

Implementation of these practices varies.  Schools most frequently use the inclusion model for selected students with mild to moderate special needs.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, K.E., Schwartz, I&lt;/ref&gt;  Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, do not separate "general education" and "special education" programs; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scheyer ''et al.'' (1996). The Inclusive Classroom Teacher Created Materials, Inc. ''[http://lib.syndetics.com/hw7.pl?isbn=1557348804/LC.JPG The Inclusive Classroom]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the 'integration' or '[[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreaming]]' model of education, which tended to be concerned principally with disability and special educational needs, and learners changing or becoming 'ready for' or deserving of accommodation by the mainstream.  By contrast, inclusion is about the child's right to participate and the school's duty to accept the child.

A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights.  Feeling included is not limited to physical and cognitive disabilities, but also includes the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and of other forms of human differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Inclusive Design|url=http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc|website=Inclusive Design Research Centre|publisher=OCAD University|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett wrote, "student performance and behaviour in educational tasks can be profoundly affected by the way we feel, we are seen and judged by others.  When we expect to be viewed as inferior, our abilities seem to diminish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Richard|last2=Pickett|first2=Kate|title=The Spirit Level- Why Equity is Better for Everyone|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books|location=England|isbn=978-0-241-95429-4|pages=113|edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration and mainstreaming==
Inclusion has different historical roots which may be integration of students with severe disabilities in the US (who may previously been excluded from schools or even lived in institutions)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. &amp; Ferguson, D. (1985). A summary of strategies utilized in model programs and resource materials. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Integration of Students with Severe Handicaps in Regular Schools''. Washington, DC: The Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnorr, R. (1990). Peter? He comes and goes...First graders' perspectives on a part-time mainstream student. ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 15(4): 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. (1986, winter). Education Integration/Integracion Scolaire. ''Entourage'', 1(1): 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; or an inclusion model from Canada and the US (e.g., Syracuse University, New York) which is very popular with inclusion teachers who believe in participatory learning, cooperative learning, and inclusive classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sapon-Shevin, M., Ayres, B., &amp; Duncan, J. (1994). Cooperative learning and inclusion. In: J. S. Thousand, R.A. Villa, &amp; A.I. Nevins, ''Creativity and Collaborative Learning: A Practical Guide to Empowering Students and Teachers''. (pp. 45-58). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education differs from the early university 
  professor's work (e.g., 1970s, Education Professor Carol Berrigan of Syracuse University, 1985; Douglas Biklen, Dean of School of Education through 2011) in ''[[Educational integration|integration]]'' and ''mainstreaming''&lt;ref&gt;Biklen, D. (1985). ''Achieving the Complete School: Strategies for Effective Mainsreaming''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which were taught throughout the world including in international seminars in Italy. Mainstreaming (e.g., the Human Policy Press poster; If you thought the wheel was a good idea, you'll like the ramp)tended to be concerned about "readiness" of all parties for the new coming together of students with significant needs. Thus, integration and mainstreaming principally was concerned about disability and 'special educational needs' (since the children were not in the regular schools) and involved teachers, students, principals, administrators, School Boards, and parents changing and becoming 'ready for'&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, C., Palombaro, M., &amp; Hollowood, T. (1993). On the nature and change of an inclusive elementary school. ''JASH'', 18(2): 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt; students who needed accommodation or new methods of curriculum and instruction (e.g., required federal IEPs – [[individualized education program]])&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, P., Goetz, L., &amp; Anderson, J. (1986, Summer). The quality of IEP objectives associated with placement on integrated versus segregated school sites. ''The Journal of The Association for Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 11(2): 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, M. &amp; Browder, D.M. (1986, Spring). Community-referenced instruction: Research and issues. ''JASH'', 11(1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, P.S. (1994, Spring). Judgment of the social validity of instructional strategies used in community-based instructional sites. ''JASH'', 19(1): 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Table 6.3: Curriculum for students with severe handicaps. ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 134). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, A. &amp; Davern, L. (1989). Moving forward on school integration: Strategies for involving studennt with severe disabilities in the life of the school. In: R. Gaylord-Ross, ''Integration Strategies for Persons with Handicaps''. (pp. 11-31). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, inclusion is about the child’s right to participate and the school’s duty to accept the child returning to the US Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education decision and the new Individuals with Disabilities Education (Improvement) Act (IDEIA).  Inclusion rejects the use of [[special schools]] or classrooms, which remain popular among large multi-service providers, to separate students with disabilities from students without disabilities.  A premium is placed upon full participation by students with disabilities, in contrast to earlier concept of partial participation in the mainstream,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Schwarz, P., Udvari-Solner, A., Kampchroer, E., Johnson, F., Jorgensen, J., &amp; Gruenewald, L. (1991, Spring). How much time should students with severe intellectual disabilities spend in regular education classrooms and elsewhere? ''JASH'', 16(1): 39-47.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon respect for their social, civil, and educational rights. Inclusion gives students with disabilities skills they can use in and out of the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;"Students learn the importance of individual and group contributions and develop valuable life skills that are often unexplored in less inclusive settings" (Tapasak 216). Tapasak, Renee and Christine Walther-Thomas. "Evaluation of a First-Year Inclusion Program:Student Perceptions and Classroom Performance." Remedial and Special Education 20(1999): 216-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fully inclusive schools and general or special education policies==
Fully inclusive schools, which are rare, no longer distinguish between "general education" and "[[special education]]" programs which refers to the debates and federal initiatives of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, W. (1989). The regular education initiative debate: Its promises and pitfalls. ''Exceptional Children'', 55(5): 440-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, J. (1989). The regular education initiative as Reagan-Bush education policy: A trickle down theory of the education of the hard-to-teach. ''The Journal of Special Education'', 23(3): 256- 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, S. &amp; Stainback, W. (1984). A rationale for the merger of special and regular education. ''Exceptional Children'', 51: 102-11.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Community Integration Project&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, J. &amp; Meyer, L. (1986). Principles and practices for school integration of students with severe disabilities: An overview of the literature. In: M. Berres &amp; P. Knoblock, ''Managerial Models of Mainstreaming''. Rockville, MD: Aspen.&lt;/ref&gt; and the debates on home schools and special education-regular education classrooms;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L., Long, E., Udvari-Solner, A., Schwarz, P., VenDeventer, P., et al. (1989, Spring). Should students with severe intellectual disabilities be based in regular or in special education classrooms in home schools? ''Journal of the Association of Persons with Severe Handicaps'', 14(1): 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, the school is restructured so that all students learn together.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sailor, W. (1991, November/December). Special education in the restructured school. ''Remedial and Special Education'', 12(6): 8-22.&lt;/ref&gt; All approaches to inclusive schooling require administrative and managerial changes to move from the traditional approaches to elementary and high school education.&lt;ref&gt;Sage, D.D. (1996). Administrative strategies for achieving inclusive schooling. (pp. 105-116). In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion remains in 2015 as part of school (e.g., Powell &amp; Lyle, 1997, now to the most integrated setting from LRE)&lt;ref&gt;Powell, D. &amp; Hyle, A. (12997, May). Principals and school reform: Barriers to inclusion in three secondary schools. ''Journal of School Leadership'', Volume 7: 301-326&lt;/ref&gt; and educational reform initiatives in the US&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy, T.G. (1989). Book Review of D. K. Liptsky and A. Gartner, ''School Reform for All Students: An Essay Review of Beyond Separate Education: Quality Education for All''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of the world. Inclusion is an effort to improve quality in education in the fields of disability, is a common theme in educational reform for decades,&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J., (1999). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life: Toward Universal Approaches to Support''. (p. 219). Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN, 2006). Inclusion has been researched and studied for decades, though reported lighly in the public with early studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous ability groupings (Stainback &amp; Stainback, 1989),&lt;ref&gt;Stainback, W. &amp; Stainback, W. C. (1989). Classroom organization for diversity among students. In: D. Biklen, D. Ferguson &amp; Al Ford, ''Schooling and Disability''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; studies of critical friends and inclusion facilitators (e.g., Jorgensen &amp; Tashie, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C. &amp; Tashie, C. (2000). Turning points: The story of high school inclusion in New Hampshire. (pp. 131-176). In: J. Nisbet &amp; D. Hagner, ''Part of the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; self-contained to general education reversal of 90% (Fried &amp; Jorgensen, 1998),&lt;ref&gt;Fried, R.L. &amp; Jorgensen, C.M (1998). Equity and excellence: Finding common ground between inclusive education and school reform. In: C. M. Jorgensen, ''Restructuring High School For All Students''. (pp. 15–28). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; among many others obtaining doctoral degrees throughout the US.

==Classification of students and educational practices==
Classification of students by disability is standard in educational systems which use diagnostic, educational and psychological testing, among others. However, inclusion has been associated with its own planning, including MAPS which Jack Pearpoint leads with still leads in 2015&lt;ref&gt;Forest, M. &amp; Pearpoint, J.. (1992). MAPS: Action planning. (pp. 52–56). In: J. Pearpoint, M. Forest, &amp; J. Snow, ''The Inclusion Papers: Strategies to Make Inclusion Work''. Toronto, Canada: The Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[person-centred planning]] with John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien who view inclusion as a force for school renewal.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. &amp; Lyle O'Brien, C. (1996). Inclusion as a force for school renewal. In : S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Inclusion: A Guide for Educators''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion has two sub-types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrE8sgg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/inclusion.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |df= }} Definition of inclusion, accessed October 11, 2007.  2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; the first is sometimes called '''regular inclusion''' or '''partial inclusion''', and the other is '''full inclusion'''.&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;Bowe, Frank.

''Inclusive practice'' is not always inclusive but is a form of integration.  For example, students with special needs are educated in regular classes for nearly all of the day, or at least for more than half of the day.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Whenever possible, the students receive any additional help or special instruction in the general classroom, and the student is treated like a full member of the class. However, most specialized services are provided outside a regular classroom, particularly if these services require special equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class (such as [[speech therapy]]), and students are pulled out of the regular classroom for these services.  In this case, the student occasionally leaves the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services, such as speech and language therapy, [[occupational therapy|occupational]] and/or [[physical therapy]], psychological services, and social work.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; This approach can be very similar to many [[mainstreaming in education|mainstreaming]] practices, and may differ in little more than the educational ideals behind it.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;

In the "full inclusion" setting, the students with special needs are always educated alongside students without special needs, as the first and desired option while maintaining appropriate supports and services. Some educators say this might be more effective for the students with special needs.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology&gt;"Understanding Psychology Eighth Edition", Feldman, Robert S. (2008), page 309. Retrieved 2010-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the extreme, full inclusion is the integration of all students, even those that require the most substantial educational and behavioral supports and services to be successful in regular classes and the elimination of special, segregated special education classes.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt; Special education is considered a service, not a place and those services are integrated into the daily routines (See, ecological inventories) and classroom structure, environment, curriculum and strategies and brought to the student, instead of removing the student to meet his or her individual needs. However, this approach to full inclusion is somewhat controversial, and it is not widely understood or applied to date.&lt;ref name=UnderstandingPsychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Student teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of children with special needs. Educational Psychology,'' Hastings. R.P., &amp; Oakford, S. (2003), page 23, 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mainstreaming to full inclusion: From orthogenesis to pathogenesis of an idea. International Journal of Disability, Development, and Education,'' Kavale, K.A. (2002), page 49, 201-214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attitudes of elementary school principals toward the inclusion of students with disabilities. Exceptional Children,'' Praisner, C. L. (2003), page 69, 135-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much more commonly, local educational agencies have the responsibility to organize services for children with disabilities. They may provide a variety of settings, from special classrooms to mainstreaming to inclusion, and assign, as teachers and administrators often do, students to the system that seems most likely to help the student achieve his or her individual educational goals.  Students with mild or moderate disabilities, as well as disabilities that do not affect academic achievement, such as using power [[wheelchair]], scooter or other mobility device, are most likely to be fully included; indeed, children with polio or with leg injuries have grown to be leaders and teachers in government and universities; self advocates travel across the country and to different parts of the world. However, students with all types of disabilities from all the different disability categories (See, also 2012 book by Michael Wehmeyer from the University of Kansas) have been successfully included in general education classes, working and achieving their individual educational goals in regular school environments and activities (reference needed).

===Alternatives to inclusion programs: school procedures and community development===
Students with disabilities who are not included are typically either mainstreamed or segregated.

A [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] student attends some general education classes, typically for less than half the day, and often for less academically rigorous, or if you will, more interesting and career-oriented classes.  For example, a young student with significant [[intellectual disabilities]] might be mainstreamed for physical education classes, art classes and storybook time, but spend reading and mathematics classes with other students that have similar disabilities ("needs for the same level of academic instruction"). They may have access to a [[resource room]] for remediation or enhancement of course content, or for a variety of group and individual meetings and consultations.

A segregated student attends no classes with non-disabled students with disability a tested category determined before or at school entrance.  He or she might attend a [[special school]] termed residential schools that only enrolls other students with disabilities, or might be placed in a dedicated, self-contained classroom in a school that also enrolls general education students.  The latter model of integration, like the 1970s Jowonio School in Syracuse, is often highly valued when combined with teaching such as [[Montessori education]] techniques. Home schooling was also a popular alternative among highly educated parents with children with significant disabilities.

Residential schools have been criticized for decades, and the government has been asked repeatedly to keep funds and services in the local districts, including for family support services for parents who may be currently single and raising a child with significant challenges on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). ''Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support for All''. Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs may already be involved with early childhood education which can have a [[family support]] component emphasizing the strengths of the child and family.&lt;ref&gt;Dunst, C.J. &amp; Trivette, C.M. (2012). Capacity-building family-system intervention practices. (pp. 33–57). In: G.H. S. Singer, Biegel, D.E. &amp; Conway, P., ''Family Support and Family Caregiving across Disabilities''. London &amp; NY, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students may be confined to a hospital due to a medical condition (e.g., cancer treatments) and are thus eligible for tutoring services provided by a school district.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C., Schuh, M., &amp; Nisbet, J. (2005). The inclusion facilitator's guide. Baltimore: Paul H.

==Legal issues: education law and disability laws==
The new anti-discriminatory climate has provided the basis for much change in policy and statute, nationally and internationally. Inclusion has been enshrined at the same time that segregation and discrimination have been rejected. Articulations of the new developments in ways of thinking, in policy and in law include:
* The UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) which sets out children’s rights in respect of freedom from discrimination and in respect of the representation of their wishes and views.
* The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]] of [[UNESCO]] prohibits any discrimination, [[social exclusion|exclusion]] or [[racial segregation|segregation]] in education.
* The [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921043927/http://www.unesco.org/en/inclusive-education/ |archivedate=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salamanca Statement (1994) which calls on all governments to give the highest priority to inclusive education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/pdf/SALAMA_E.PDF ''Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs.''] (PDF-File, 198 KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the least restrictive to the most integrated setting===
For [[special education in the United States|schools in the United States]], the federal requirement that students be educated in the historic [[least restrictive environment]] that is [[reasonable]] encourages the implementation of inclusion of students previously excluded by the school system.&lt;ref&gt;Karp, N. &amp; Taylor, S.J. (1988). ''The Least Restrictive Environment and Community Integration: A Leadership Institute''. Washington, DC and Syracuse, NY: National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation and Syracuse University, Center on Human Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, M., Blacher, J., Duffy, S., Hardman, M., McDonnell, J., Nisbet, J., Safer, N., &amp; Snell, M. (2005). Effective education in the least restrictive environment. In: K.C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and the American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a critical critique of the LRE principle, commonly used to guide US schools, indicates that it often places restrictions and segregation on the individuals with the most severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J. (1988, Spring). Caught in the continuum: A critical analysis of the principles of the least restrictive environment. ''JASH'', 13(1): 41-53.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, individuals with significant disabilities and their families and caregivers were already living quality lives in homes and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.J., Racino, J., Knoll, J., &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. (1987). ''The Least Restrictive Environment: On Community Integration of Persons with the Most Severe Disabilities''. Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheerenberger, R.

NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Luckily, the US Supreme Court has now ruled in the Olmstead Decision (1999) that the new principle is that of the "most integrated setting",&lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2012). ''Olmstead Implementation and the Concept of the Most Integrated Setting''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; as described by the national Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, which should result in better achievement of national integration and inclusion goals in the 21st Century.

==Inclusion rates in the world: "frequency of use"==
The proportion of students with disabilities who are ''included'' varies by place and by type of disability, but it is relatively common for students with milder disabilities and less common with certain kinds of severe disabilities.  In Denmark, 99% of students with [[learning disabilities]] like 'dyslexia' are placed in general education classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vouchers Help the Learning Disabled:  Lesson from 22 countries: Special-education students thrive in private schools

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, three out of five students with learning disabilities spend the  majority of their time in the general education classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009). [http://www.ncld.org/stateofld The State of Learning Disabilities.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706072327/http://www.ncld.org/stateofld |date=2009-07-06 }} New York, NY: National Center for Learning Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postsecondary statistics (after high school) are kept by universities and government on the success rates of students entering college, and most are eligible for either disability services (e.g., accommodations and aides) or programs on college campuses, such as supported education in psychiatric disabilities or College for Living. The former are fully integrated college degree programs with college and vocational rehabilitation services (e.g., payments for textbooks, readers or translators), and the latter courses developed similar to retirement institutes (e.g., banking for retirees).

==Principles and necessary resources==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}Although once hailed,{{By whom|date=August 2016}} usually by its opponents, as a way to increase achievement while decreasing costs, full inclusion does not save money, but is more cost-beneficial and cost-effective. It is not designed to reduce students' needs, and its first priority may not even be to improve academic outcomes; in most cases, it merely moves the special education professionals (now dual certified for all students in some states) out of "their own special education" classrooms and into a corner of the general classroom or as otherwise designed by the "teacher-in-charge" and "administrator-in-charge".  To avoid harm to the academic education of students with disabilities, a full panoply of services and resources is required (of education for itself), including:&lt;ref&gt;This list from the [[Utah Education Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate supports and services for the student
* Well-designed [[individualized education program]]s
* Professional development for all teachers involved, general and special educators alike
* Time for teachers to plan, meet, create, and evaluate the students together
* Reduced class size based on the severity of the student needs
* Professional skill development in the areas of cooperative learning, peer tutoring, adaptive curriculum
* Collaboration between parents or guardians, teachers or para educators, specialists, administration, and outside agencies.
* Sufficient funding so that schools will be able to develop programs for students based on student need instead of the availability of funding.
Indeed, the students with special needs do receive funds from the federal government, by law originally the Educational for All Handicapped Children Act of 1974 to the present day, Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which requires its use in the most integrated setting.

In principle, several factors can determine the success of inclusive classrooms:
* Family-school partnerships
* Collaboration between general and special educators
* Well-constructed plans that identify specific accommodations, modifications, and goals for each student
* Coordinated planning and communication between "general" and "special needs" staff
* Integrated service delivery
* Ongoing training and staff development
* Leadership of teachers and administrators

By the mid-1980s, school integration leaders in the university sector already had detailed schemas (e.g., curriculum, student days, students with severe disabilities in classrooms) with later developments primarily in assistive technology and communication, school reform and transformation, personal assistance of user-directed aides, and increasing emphasis on social relationships and cooperative learning.  In 2015, most important are evaluations of the populations still in special schools, including those who may be deaf-blind, and the leadership by inclusion educators, who often do not yet go by that name, in the education and community systems.

===Differing views of inclusion and integration===
However, early integrationists{{Who|date=August 2016}} [[community integration]] would still recommend greater emphasis on programs related to sciences, the arts (e.g., exposure), curriculum integrated field trips, and literature as opposed to the sole emphasis on community referenced curriculum. For example, a global citizen studying the environment might be involved with planting a tree ("independent mobility"), or going to an arboretum ("social and relational skills"), developing a science project with a group ("contributing ideas and planning"), and having two core modules in the curriculum.

However, students will need to either continue to secondary school (meet academic testing standards), make arrangements for employment, supported education, or home/day services (transition services), and thus, develop the skills for future life (e.g., academic math skills and calculators; planning and using recipes or leisure skills) in the educational classrooms. Inclusion often involved individuals who otherwise might be at an institution or residential facility.

Today, longitudinal studies follow the outcomes of students with disabilities in classrooms, which include college graduations and quality of life outcomes. To be avoided are negative outcomes that include forms of institutionalization.

==Common practices in inclusive classrooms==
Students in an inclusive classroom are generally placed with their chronological age-mates, regardless of whether the students are working above or below the typical academic level for their age.  Also, to encourage a sense of belonging, emphasis is placed on the value of friendships. Teachers often nurture a relationship between a student with special needs and a same-age student without a special educational need. Another common practice is the assignment of a [[wikt:buddy|buddy]] to accompany a student with special needs at all times (for example in the cafeteria, on the playground, on the bus and so on). This is used to show students that a diverse group of people make up a community, that no one type of student is better than another, and to remove any barriers to a friendship that may occur if a student is viewed as "helpless." Such practices reduce the chance for elitism among students in later grades and encourage cooperation among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Strully, J., &amp; Strully, C. (1996). Friendships as an educational goal: What we have learned and where we are headed. In W. Stainback &amp; S. Stainback (Eds.), ''Inclusion: A guide for educators''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers use a number of techniques to help build classroom communities:
* Using games designed to build community
* Involving students in solving problems
* Sharing songs and books that teach community
* Openly dealing with individual differences by discussion
* Assigning classroom jobs that build community
* Teaching students to look for ways to help each other
* Utilizing [[physical therapy]] equipment such as [[standing frames]], so students who typically use wheelchairs can stand when the other students are standing and more actively participate in activities
* Encouraging students to take the role of teacher and deliver instruction (e.g. read a portion of a book to a student with severe disabilities)
* Focusing on the strength of a student with special needs
* Create classroom checklists
* Take breaks when necessary
* Create an area for children to calm down
* Organize student desk in groups
* Create a self and welcoming environment
* Set ground rules and stick with them
* Help establish short-term goals
* Design a multi-faced curriculum
* Communicate regular with parents and/or caregivers
* Seek support from other special education teachers

'''Inclusionary practices are commonly utilized by using the following team-teaching models:'''
* One teach, one support:
In this model, the content teacher will deliver the lesson and the special education teacher will assist students individual needs and enforce classroom management as needed.
* One teach, one observe:
In this model, the teacher with the most experience in the content will deliver the lesson and the other teacher will float or observe.  This model is commonly used for data retrieval during IEP observations or Functional Behavior Analysis.
* Station teaching (rotational teaching):
In this model, the room is divided into stations in which the students will visit with their small groups.  Generally, the content teacher will deliver the lesson in his/her group, and the special education teacher will complete a review or adapted version of the lesson with the students.
* Parallel teaching:
In this model, one half of the class is taught by the content teacher and one half is taught by the special education teacher.  Both groups are being taught the same lesson, just in a smaller group.
* Alternative teaching:
In this method, the content teacher will teach the lesson to the class, while the special education teacher will teach a small group of students an alternative lesson.
* Team teaching (content/support shared 50/50):
Both teachers share the planning, teaching, and supporting equally.  This is the traditional method, and often the most successful co-teaching model.

===Children with extensive support needs===
For children with significant or severe disabilities, the programs may require what are termed health supports (e.g., positioning and lifting; visit to the nurse clinic), direct one-to-one aide in the classroom, assistive technology, and an individualized program which may involve the student "partially" (e.g., videos and cards for "visual stimulation"; listening to responses)in the full lesson plan for the "general education student". It may also require introduction of teaching techniques commonly used (e.g., introductions and interest in science) that teachers may not use within a common core class.

Another way to think of health supports are as a range of services that may be needed from specialists, or sometimes generalists, ranging from speech and language, to visual and hearing (sensory impairments), behavioral, learning, orthopedics, autism, deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury, according to Virginia Commonwealth University's Dr. Paul Wehman.&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P. (1997). ''Exceptional Individuals in School, Community and Work''. Austin, TX: PRO-ED.&lt;/ref&gt; As Dr. Wehman has indicated, expectations can include post secondary education, supported employment in competitive sites, and living with family or other residential places in the community.

In 2005, comprehensive health supports were described in National Goals for Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities as universally available, affordable and promoting inclusion, as supporting well-informed, freely chose health care decisions, culturally competent, promoting health promotion, and insuring well trained and respectful health care providers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, D., Bacon, A., Birenbaum, A., Campbell, V., Cerreto, M., Corbin, S., Crocker, A., Krahn, G., McClain, C., McDermott, Nehring, W., Pietrangelo, R., Rader, R., Spitalnik, D. &amp; White-Scott, S.(2005). Comprehensive health support and health promotion. (pp.109-124).  In: K. C. Lakin &amp; A. Turnbull, ''National Goals and Research for People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities''. Washington, DC: The Arc of the US and American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, mental health, behavioral, communication and crisis needs may need to be planned for and addressed.
 
"Full inclusion" – the idea that all children, including those with severe disabilities, can and should learn in a regular classroom has also taken root in many school systems, and most notably in the province of New Brunswick.

==Collaboration among the professions==
Inclusion settings allow children with and without disabilities to play and interact every day, even when they are receiving therapeutic services. When a child displays fine motor difficulty, his ability to fully participate in common classroom activities, such as cutting, coloring, and zipping a jacket may be hindered.  While occupational therapists are often called to assess and implement strategies outside of school, it is frequently left up to classroom teachers to implement strategies in school. Collaborating with occupational therapists will help classroom teachers use intervention strategies and increase teachers' awareness about students' needs within school settings and enhance teachers' independence in implementation of occupational therapy strategies.

As a result of the 1997 re-authorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals With Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA), greater emphasis has been placed on delivery of related services within inclusive, general education environments. [Nolan, 2004] The importance of inclusive, integrated models of service delivery for children with disabilities has been widely researched indicating positive benefits. [Case-Smith&amp; Holland, 2009] In traditional "pull out" service delivery models, children typically work in isolated settings one on one with a therapist, Case-Smith and Holland(2009) argue that children working on skills once or twice a week are "less likely to produce learning that leads to new behaviors and increased competence." [Case Smith &amp;Holland, 2009, pg.419]. In recent years, occupational therapy has shifted from the conventional model of "pull out" therapy to an integrated model where the therapy takes place within a school or classroom.

Inclusion administrators have been requested to review their personnel to assure mental health personnel for children with mental health needs, vocational rehabilitation linkages for work placements, community linkages for special populations (e.g., "deaf-blind", "autism"), and collaboration among major community agencies for after school programs and transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., Destefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policy''. Sycamore, IL: Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schall, C. &amp; McFarland-Whisman, J. (2009). Meeting transition goals through inclusion. (pp.95-110). In: P. Wehman, Datlow-Smith, M. &amp; Schall, C., ''Autism and the Transition to Adulthood: Success Beyond the Classroom''. Sydney, Australia: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Highly recommended are collaborations with parents, including parent-professional partnerships in areas of cultural and linguistic diversity (e.g., Syracuse University's special education Ph.D.'s Maya Kaylanpur and Beth Harry).

==Selection of students for inclusion programs in schools==
Educators generally say that some students with special needs are not good candidates for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Doug. "Transformation Ahead for Special Education"  ''The Arizona Republic.'' 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Many schools expect a fully included student to be working at or near [[grade level]], but more fundamental requirements exist:  First, being included requires that the student is able to attend [[school]].  Students that are entirely excluded from school (for example, due to long-term hospitalization), or who are educated outside of schools (for example, due to enrollment in a [[distance education]] program) cannot attempt inclusion.

Additionally, some students with special needs are poor candidates for inclusion because of their effect on other students.  For example, students with severe behavioral problems, such that they represent a serious physical danger to others, are poor candidates for inclusion, because the school has a duty to provide a safe environment to all students and staff.

Finally, some students are not good candidates for inclusion because the normal activities in a general education classroom will prevent them from learning.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  For example, a student with severe attention difficulties or extreme [[sensory processing disorder]]s might be highly distracted or distressed by the presence of other students working at their desks. Inclusion needs to be appropriate to the child's unique needs.

Most students with special needs do not fall into these extreme categories, as most students do attend school, are not violent, do not have severe sensory processing disorders, etc.

The students that are most commonly included are those with physical disabilities that have no or little effect on their academic work ([[diabetes mellitus]], [[epilepsy]], [[food allergies]], [[paralysis]]), students with all types of mild disabilities, and students whose disabilities require relatively few specialized services.

Bowe says that regular inclusion, but not full inclusion, is a reasonable approach for a significant majority of students with special needs.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt;  He also says that for some students, notably those with severe [[autism spectrum]] disorders or [[mental retardation]], as well as many who are [[deaf]] or have multiple disabilities, even regular inclusion may not offer an appropriate education.&lt;ref name=Bowe /&gt; Teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes use antecedent procedures, delayed contingencies, self-management strategies, peer-mediated interventions, [[pivotal response training]] and naturalistic teaching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to progressive education ==
Some advocates of inclusion promote the adoption of [[progressive education]] practices.  In the progressive education or inclusive classroom, everyone is exposed to a "rich set of activities", and each student does what he or she can do, or what he or she wishes to do and learns whatever comes from that experience. [[Maria Montessori]]'s schools are sometimes named as an example of inclusive education.

Inclusion requires some changes in how teachers teach, as well as changes in how students with and without special needs interact with and relate to one another.  Inclusive education practices frequently rely on active learning, [[Authentic assessment|authentic assessment practices]], applied curriculum, multi-level instructional approaches, and increased attention to diverse student needs and individualization.

sometimes it is not necessary that there will always be a positive environment and therefore a lot of attention of the teachers is also required along with the support of other children which will ensure a peaceful and happy place for both kinds of children.

==Arguments for full inclusion in regular neighborhood schools==
Advocates say that even partial non-inclusion is morally unacceptable.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;Stainback, W., &amp; Stainback, S. (1995). ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education''. Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents believe that non-inclusion reduces the disabled students' social importance and that maintaining their social visibility is more important than their academic achievement. Proponents say that society accords disabled people less [[human dignity]] when they are less visible in general education classrooms. Advocates say that even if typical students are harmed academically by the full inclusion of certain special needs students, that the non-inclusion of these students would still be morally unacceptable, as advocates believe that the harm to typical students' education is always less important than the social harm caused by making people with disabilities less visible in society.&lt;ref name=SS /&gt;

A second key argument is that everybody benefits from inclusion. Advocates say that there are many children and young people who don't fit in (or feel as though they don't), and that a school that fully includes all disabled students feels welcoming to all. Moreover, at least one author has studied the impact a diversified student body has on the general education population and has concluded that students with mental retardation who spend time among their peers show an increase in social skills and academic proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Trainer, M. (1991). ''Differences in common: Straight talk on mental retardation, Down Syndrome, and life''. Rockville, MD" Woodbine house.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for inclusion say that the long-term effects of typical students who are included with special needs students at a very young age have a heightened sensitivity to the challenges that others face, increased empathy and compassion, and improved leadership skills, which benefits all of society.&lt;ref&gt;Giangreco, M.F., Cloninger, C.J., &amp; Iverson, V.S.(1998). Choosing outcomes and accommodations for Children (COACH): A guide to educational planning for students with disabilities (2nd ed.). Baltimore: Paul H Brookes Publishing Co&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of inclusion and pull-out (partial inclusion) services has been shown to be beneficial to students with learning disabilities in the area of reading comprehension, and preferential for the special education teachers delivering the services.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Douglas. ''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 30, No. 2, 121–132 (1996)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusive education can be beneficial to all students in a class, not just students with special needs. Some research show that inclusion helps students understand the importance of working together, and fosters a sense of tolerance and empathy among the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies, R.M. (2004). The effects of cooperative learning on junior high school students during small group learning. ''Learning and Instruction'' there are inclusion units and other rooms in some schools which focus on these aspects, 14(2), 197–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects in regular classrooms==
There are many positive effects of inclusions where both the students with special needs along with the other students in the classroom both benefit. Research has shown positive effects for children with disabilities in areas such as reaching individualized education program (IEP) goal, improving communication and social skills, increasing positive peer interactions, many educational outcomes, and post school adjustments.  Positive effects on children without disabilities include the development of positive attitudes and perceptions of persons with disabilities and the enhancement of social status with non-disabled peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, T., Deluca, D., &amp; Bruns, D. (1997). Putting inclusion into practice: perspectives of teachers and parents. ''Exceptional Children,'' 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several studies have been done on the effects of inclusion of children with disabilities in general education classrooms. A study on inclusion compared integrated and segregated (special education only) preschool students. The study determined that children in the integrated sites progressed in social skills development while the segregated children actually regressed.&lt;ref&gt;Sale, P., &amp; Carey, D. (1995). The Sociometric status of students with disabilities in a full-inclusion school. ''Exceptional Children,'' 62.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Another study shows the effect on inclusion in grades 2 to 5.  The study determined that students with specific learning disabilities made some academic and affective gains at a pace comparable to that of normal achieving students.  Specific learning disabilities students also showed an improvement in [[self-esteem]] and in some cases improved motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji, M., &amp; Dailey, R. (1995). A Study of the effects of an inclusion model on students with specific learning disabilities. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' 28(8), 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study shows how the support of peers in an inclusive classroom can lead to positive effects for children with [[autism]].  The study observed typical inclusion classrooms, ages ranging from 7 years old to 11 years old.  The peers were trained on an intervention technique to help their fellow autistic classmates stay on task and focused.  The study showed that using peers to intervene instead of classroom teachers helped students with autism reduce off-task behaviors significantly.  It also showed that the typical students accepted the student with autism both before and after the intervention techniques were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Use of a peer support intervention for promoting academic engagement of students with autism in general education settings|last = McCurdy|first = E.

==Criticisms of inclusion programs of school districts==
Critics of full and partial inclusion include educators, administrators and parents. Full and partial inclusion approaches neglect to acknowledge the fact that most students with significant special needs require individualized instruction or highly controlled environments.  Thus, general education classroom teachers often are teaching a curriculum while the special education teacher is remediating instruction at the same time.  Similarly, a child with serious inattention problems may be unable to focus in a classroom that contains twenty or more active children. Although with the increase of incidence of disabilities in the student population, this is a circumstance all teachers must contend with, and is not a direct result of inclusion as a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, R.A. (1998). ''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Full inclusion may be a way for schools to placate parents and the general public, using the word as a phrase to garner attention for what are in fact illusive efforts to educate students with special needs in the general education environment.&lt;ref&gt;JM Kauffman, DP Hallahan.''The Illusion of Full Inclusion: A Comprehensive Critique of a Current Special Education Bandwagon''. PRO-ED, Inc., 8700 Shoal Creek Blvd., Austin, TX 78757-6897&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study examined the lack of individualized services provided for students with IEPs when placed in an inclusive rather than mainstreamed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C.A.Individualized Education Programs in Resource and Inclusive Settings.''The Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 32, No. 3, 164–174 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have maintained school districts neglect to prepare general education staff for students with special needs, thus preventing any achievement. Moreover, school districts often expound an inclusive philosophy for political reasons, and do away with any valuable pull-out services, all on behalf of the students who have no so say in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Laurence M. ''Preserving Special Education''. Weston: Nobb Hill Press Inc, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion is viewed by some as a practice philosophically attractive yet impractical.  Studies have not corroborated the proposed advantages of full or partial inclusion. Moreover, "push in" servicing does not allow students with moderate to severe disabilities individualized instruction in a [[resource room]], from which many show considerable benefit in both learning and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;An Investigation of the Effectiveness of Resource Rooms for Children with Specific Learning Disabilities Lawrence H. Weiner Journal of Learning Disabilities, Apr 1969; vol. 2: pp. 223 - 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents of disabled students may be cautious about placing their children in an inclusion program because of fears that the children will be ridiculed by other students, or be unable to develop regular life skills in an academic classroom.&lt;ref&gt;This information provided by SEDL.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that inclusive schools are not a cost-effective response when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as [[special education]].  They argue that special education helps "fix" the special needs students by providing individualized and personalized instruction to meet their unique needs.  This is to help students with special needs adjust as quickly as possible to the mainstream of the school and community.  Proponents counter that students with special needs are not fully into the mainstream of student life because they are secluded to special education.  Some argue that isolating students with special needs may lower their self-esteem and may reduce their ability to deal with other people.  In keeping these students in separate classrooms they aren't going to see the struggles and achievements that they can make together. However, at least one study indicated [[mainstreaming in education]] has long-term benefits for students as indicated by increased test scores,&lt;ref&gt;van den Bos, K.P., Nakken, H., Nicolay, P.G.,&amp; van Houten, E.J. (2007). Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: Can their reading comprehension ability be improved? ''Journal of Intellectual Disability Research'', 51(11), 830–845.&lt;/ref&gt; where the benefit of inclusion has not yet been proved.

== Broader approach: social and cultural inclusion ==
As used by UNESCO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf|title=Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; inclusion refers to far more than students with special educational needs.  It is centered on the inclusion of  marginalized groups, such as religious, racial, ethnic, and linguistic minorities, immigrants, girls, the poor, students with disabilities, HIV/AIDS patients, remote populations, and more.  In some places, these people are not actively included in education and learning processes.&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines"&gt;UNESCO (2009) Policy Guidelines on Inclusion in Education. UNESCO: Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0017/001778/177849e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. this broader definition is also known as "culturally responsive" education, which differs from the 1980s-1990s cultural diversity and cultural competency approaches,&lt;ref&gt;Harry, B. (1992). ''Cultural Diversity, Families and the Special Education System''. NY, NY: Teachers College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, T.B., Bazron, B. &amp; Dennis, K. W. (1989). ''Towards Culturally Competent System of Care''. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Child Development Center.&lt;/ref&gt; and is promoted among the ten equity assistance centers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/equitycenters/index.html|title=Training and Advisory Services - Equity Assistance Centers|date=1 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the U.S. Department of Education, for example in Region IX (AZ, CA, NV), by the Equity Alliance at ASU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equityallianceatasu.org/|title=Home - The Equity Alliance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Ladson-Billings]]&lt;ref name="Gloria Ladson-Billings"&gt;Ladson-Billings, B. (1992). Reading between the lines and beyond the pages: A culturally relevant approach to literacy teaching.  Theory Into Practice, 31(4), 312-320.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that teachers who are culturally responsive know how to base learning experiences on the cultural realities of the child (e.g. home life, community experiences, language background, belief systems). Proponents argue that [http://ea.niusileadscape.org/lc/Record/137?search_query=Culturally%20Responsive culturally responsive pedagogy] is good for all students because it builds a caring community where everyone's experiences and abilities are valued.

Proponents want to maximize the participation of all learners in the community schools of their choice and to rethink and restructure policies, curricula, cultures and practices in schools and learning environments so that diverse learning needs can be met, whatever the origin or nature of those needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bps.org.uk/downloadfile.cfm?file_uuid=CE1DCB9D-1143-DFD0-7EA9-5C1B82EA4596&amp;ext=doc British Psychological Society position statement on inclusive education&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that all students can learn and benefit from education, and that schools should adapt to the physical, social, and cultural needs of students, rather than students adapting to the needs of the school. Proponents believe that individual differences between students are a source of richness and diversity, which should be supported through a wide and flexible range of responses. The challenge of rethinking and restructuring schools to become more culturally responsive calls for a complex systems view of the educational system (e.g.see Michael Patton&lt;ref name="Developmental Evaluation"&gt;Patton, M. (2011). Developmental evaluation: Applying complexity concepts to enhance innovation and use. New York, NY, The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;), where one can extend the idea of strength through diversity to all participants in the educational system (e.g. parents, teachers, community members, staff).

Although inclusion is generally associated with elementary and secondary education, it is also applicable in postsecondary education.  According to UNESCO, inclusion "is increasingly understood more broadly as a reform that supports and welcomes diversity amongst all learners."&lt;ref name="PolicyGuidelines" /&gt;  Under this broader definition of inclusion, steps should also be taken to eliminate discrimination and provide accommodations for all students who are at a disadvantage because of some reason other than disability.

===Benefiting in an inclusive environment===
"The inclusion of age-appropriate students in a general education classroom, alongside those with and without disability is beneficial to both parties involved. (Waitoller and Thorius) With inclusive education, all students are exposed to the same curriculum, they develop their own individual potential, and participate in the same activities at the same time. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which learning takes place because students learn differently, at their own pace and by their own style. (Carter, Moss, Asmus, Fesperman, Cooney, Brock, Lyons, Huber, and Vincent) Effectively, inclusive education provides a nurturing venue where teaching and learning should occur despite pros and cons. It is evident that students with disabilities benefit more in an inclusive atmosphere because they can receive help from their peers with diverse abilities and they compete at the same level due to equal opportunities given."

==Academic Background==
In 1976 Jawahir Thontowi graduated from the one of the first Education for Islamic Judges in Indonesia established in Yogyakarta. This was a school which will become of the pioneers of legal practitioners in Indonesia. As an example the head of the Constitution Court in Indonesia Mahfud MD is an alumnus.

Between 1978 and 1979 became the president of the Student Representative Council in The law faculty UII and at the same time the Vice director of the Human Right Commission which was later turned into the Legal Aid Institute in Yogyakarta.  In 1979-1980 become the Secretary General for Student Government Council UII then became the staff member of the community development in Muslim students association Yogyakarta.  During these years he has become a prominent activist in the campus which builds the foundation of his organization skills in later life.

In 1981 he received an LLB Degree from the Faculty of Law Universitas Islam Indonesia. Then in 1984 became the Head of Community Development Division Institute for Research and Community at the Universitas Islam Indonesia.  Then in 1986 took a course in Center for Research Training of Social Science, Universitas Hasanudin. In August that year he received an Award for an outstanding field research Stunent given by YIIS and PLPIIS in Jakarta. Working in the campus and research would then lead to further development in his academic career and an opportunity to attain higher education in Australia. This was a turning point that would excel in academic career.

In 1990 he started a preliminary Masters of Arts at the Anthology Department of UWA . Then in 1992 receive a research grant for the post graduate students from the University of Western Australia.  In 1998 finally completed his Ph.D Degree in the University of Western Australia.  He was ready to go back to Indonesia to implement his knowledge and skill in an Indonesia context, especially going back to campus to teach again. 
Upon return from Australia and going back to Indonesia holding a Ph.D he was appoint Head of the International Department for 3 years in 1999-2001. During this time he was focusing on building and improving the law faculty and made it more dynamic. He pas the team leader in various initiatives conducted by the campus such Designing University Joint Collaboration and development then Establishing the Doctorate Program in Law Faculty University.  This was a major breakthrough for UII having established a Doctorate program in the field of Law.

September 2000 he became the Director of the Doctorate Program law faculty.  In September the next year in 2001 he made an initiative to make the International Program for Law in the campus which took a one-year process. For the Law faculty he made two important contributions that are the establishment of the Doctorate program and the second the International program. March that year he was elected to become the Dean of the Law Faculty until 2006.

In 2006 the election for the Rector of UII He participated in first direct election for the position being the fourth rank,  Edy Suandi Hamid having 284.5 votes,  Amir Mu’alim 92 votes, Luthfi Hasan, 87.5 votes.  Eddy Suandi Hamid came out as winner to lead the campus.  The next election for the position as the Vice Rector I to be in charge of academics it was between Jawahir Thontowi and Sarwidi which was a very close election and Sarwidi manages to be elected for the position having 309,5 votes compared to only 298,5 votes. Supporters of Jawahir Thontowi in campus still remain strong.

In 2010 election Jawahir Thontowi became in the running for the peak positions in campus again. Still competing versus Edy Suandi Hamid and Sarwidi,  the election process was very tight Edy Suandi Hamid with only 32 votes, Jawahir Thontowi 31 votes and Sarwidi 25 votes.  Interesting that in 2006 elections he lost to Sarwidi for the position but now in the 2010 he has more votes.

After losing from the selection process, he came back to the law faculty to continue to teach, practice what he has learned and implement his understanding about the law in Indonesia. This experience will be the foundations of the position in the future for the next election process in 2014 to become the rector of campus. To have the highest academic career in UII starting as a student activist, then becoming a researcher and lecturer, then become the dean of the law faculty and hope the next position becoming the rector.

[[File:Leigh Marine Laboratory 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;Leigh Marine Laboratory&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''Leigh Marine Laboratory''' is the marine research facility for the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home Leigh Marine Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is situated in north eastern New Zealand, {{convert|100|km}} north of Auckland city. The facility is perched on the cliffs overlooking the Goat Island marine reserve that covers {{convert|5|km}} of coastline from Cape Rodney to Okakari Point. The laboratory provides the facilities to support a wide range of field based research, including overnight field trips for undergraduate students and for postgraduate students to live on campus. The laboratory has a fleet of small boats, including a {{convert|15|m}} long [[research vessel]], ''Hawere''.

==History==

Leigh Marine Laboratory was opened in 1964 in the small coastal community of [[Leigh, New Zealand|Leigh]]. The first director of the marine laboratory, [[Bill Ballantine (biologist)|Bill Ballantine]] was instrumental in the establishment of the adjacent [[Goat Island marine reserve]] in 1975, the first [[Marine reserves of New Zealand|marine protected area in New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine-reserves.org.nz/pages/ballintine.html Dr Bill Ballantine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200559/http://www.marine-reserves.org.nz/pages/ballintine.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 a major redevelopment of the Leigh Marine Laboratory began with  new facilities being opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/for/future-undergraduates/facilities-and-resources/fu-science-building-at-leigh-marine new facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The new facilities included a new accommodation and workshop building, a three story research building and an interpretive educational centre for public visitors.

==Research==

A wide range of research activities are undertaken at the laboratory, including marine [[biogeography]], [[physiology]], [[ecology]], [[genetics]], [[Fisheries science|marine fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]. The laboratory has nine academic staff on site, with seven support staff. Further academic staff from the main University of Auckland campus are also frequent users of the laboratory. Postgraduate research is a major feature of the Leigh Laboratory with more than 400 marine science theses produced from the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/our-research Postgraduate research]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of research at the Leigh Marine Laboratory is supporting the development of [[aquaculture in New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.govt.nz/ aquaculture in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong focus on the development of new aquaculture species, including [[spiny lobster]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s, [[New Zealand sea urchin|sea urchins]], and various fin fish species. In addition, research is undertaken on improving the production and sustainability of existing [[Aquaculture in New Zealand|important aquaculture species]], such as [[abalone]], [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel|mussels]] and [[Tiostrea chilensis|oysters]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8179">'''Loaded language''' (also known as '''loaded terms''', '''emotive language''', '''high-inference language''' and '''language-persuasive techniques''') is [[rhetoric]] used to influence an audience by using words and phrases with strong [[connotations]] associated with them in order to [[Pathos|invoke an emotional response]] and/or exploit [[stereotypes]].{{sfn|Weston|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dancers Human Kinetics |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-87322-667-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Loaded words and phrases have significant emotional implications and involve strongly positive or negative reactions beyond their [[literal meaning]]. For example, the phrase ''[[tax cut|tax relief]]'' refers literally to changes that reduce the amount of tax citizens must pay. However, use of the emotive word ''[[relief]]'' implies that taxation is an inherently unreasonable [[wikt:Burden#English|burden]]. Another example of loaded language is the question "Do you really want to associate with those people?", which implies a sense of disapproval from the speaker.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}}{{clarify|date=July 2018}}

==Definition==

Loaded terms, also called emotive or ethical words, were clearly described by [[Charles Stevenson]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1938|}} He noticed that there are words that do not merely describe a possible state of affairs. "[[wikt:terrorist|Terrorist]]" is not used only to refer to a person who commits specific actions with a specific intent. Words such as "[[wikt:torture|torture]]" or "[[wikt:freedom|freedom]]" carry with them something more than a simple description of a concept or an action.{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}} They have a "magnetic" effect, an imperative force, a tendency to influence the interlocutor's decisions.{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|pp=18–19}} They are strictly bound to moral values leading to value judgments and potentially triggering specific emotions. For this reason, they have an emotive dimension. In the modern psychological terminology, we can say that these terms carry "emotional valence",{{sfn|Frijda|Mesquita|2000|p=49}} as they presuppose and generate a value judgment that can lead to an emotion.{{sfn|Macagno|Walton|2014|p={{page needed|date=March 2017}} }}

The appeal to emotion is often seen{{By whom|date=October 2018}} as being in contrast to an appeal to [[logic]] and [[reason]]. Authors [[R. Malcolm Murray]] and [[Nebojša Kujundžić]] distinguish "''[[prima facie]]'' reasons" from "considered reasons" when discussing this.  An emotion, elicited via emotive language, may form a ''prima facie'' reason for action, but further work is required before one can obtain a ''considered'' reason.{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}

Emotive arguments and loaded language are particularly{{Clarify|reason=Particularly among...?|date=October 2018}} persuasive because they exploit the human weakness{{What|reason=Why is it a weakness, if even|date=October 2018}} for acting immediately based upon an emotional response, ''without'' such further considered judgment.  Due to such potential for emotional complication, it is generally advised{{By whom|date=October 2018}} to avoid loaded language in argument or speech when fairness and impartiality is one of the goals.  [[Anthony Weston]], for example, admonishes students and writers: "In general, avoid language whose only function is to sway the emotions".{{sfn|Weston|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}

==Examples==

[[Politician]]s cultivate loaded language, and often{{How often|date=October 2018}} study how to use it effectively: which words to use or avoid using to gain political advantage or disparage an opponent. Heller{{Who|date=October 2018}} gives the example that it is common for a politician to advocate "investment in public services"{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, because it has a more favorable connotation than "[[Government spending|public spending]]".{{sfn|Heller|2002|p=54}}

One aspect of loaded language is that loaded words and phrases occur in pairs, sometimes as [[political framing]] techniques by individuals with opposing agendas. Heller calls these "a Boo! version and a Hooray! version" to differentiate those with negative and positive emotional connotations. Examples include ''bureaucrat'' versus ''public servant'', ''anti-choice'' versus ''pro-life'', ''regime'' versus ''government'', and ''elitist'' versus ''expert''.{{sfn|Heller|2002|p=54}}

In the 1946 essay "[[Politics and the English Language]]", [[George Orwell]] discussed the use of loaded language in political discourse.
 	
{{quote|The word ''[[Fascism]]'' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies "something not desirable." The words ''democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice'' have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like ''democracy'', not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning.{{sfn|Orwell|1946}}

'''Marjorie J. ("Maggie") Clarke''', [[Ph.D.]], is an [[environmental scientist]] who specializes in recycling participation, waste prevention methods, [[waste-to-energy]]/incinerator emissions controls, environmental impacts of the [[Health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center fires and collapse]], and community botanical gardening. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] she has focused on increasing participation in New York City's waste prevention and recycling programs.  She is a native of Miami [[Florida]], Born July 14, 1953.

==Education==

A 1975 graduate, with B. A. in Geology of [[Smith College]], a year of which was spent at Dartmouth College on exchange program in the environmental studies program in 1973-1974, she received M.S. in [[environmental science]]s from Johns Hopkins University in 1978, M.S. in energy technology (applied sciences) from New York University in 1982, and a Ph.D. in earth &amp; environmental sciences in 2000 — City University of New York.

==Professional==
Clarke was the Department of Sanitation's specialist on [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] from [[incinerator]]s from 1984 to 1988, the author of a book&lt;ref&gt;Burning Garbage in the US—Practice vs. State-of-the-art, INFORM, New York, NY 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of publications on the subject of minimizing emissions. She also served on a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] committee on Health Effects of Waste Incineration, co-authoring the [[United States National Research Council|NRC]] publication by that name. Clarke also served on the [[New Jersey]] Standard-Setting [[Task Force]] on Mercury emissions from incinerators in the early 1990s.

From 2002-2004, she was a Scientist-in-Residence and adjunct assistant professor at [[Lehman College]], and an [[adjunct professor]] at [[Hunter College]], [[City University of New York]] from 1996 - 2005.

==Notable contributions==
Best known as a persistent questioner of [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s claims about the safety of the [[World Trade Center site]],&lt;ref&gt;Public Lives: Keeping a Wary Eye on the E.P.A. at Ground Zero, Robin Finn, for New York Times, June 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Clarke has underscored the importance of understanding [[toxicity]], synergy of chemicals acting together, and the precautionary principle, and has provided testimony to many government committees and panels, including the [[U.S. Senate]] down to the New York City Council, and has been a guest speaker in academic settings, conferences, down to local eldercare centers. Dr. Clarke laid the groundwork for the later work of such area politicians as Congressman [[Jerrold Nadler]] and Senator [[Hillary Clinton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

She also conceived and garnered support for a New York City local law to eliminate 2200 apartment building incinerators which was signed into law in 1989.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==NGO participation==
Clarke has been chair or vice chair of the ''Manhattan Citizens' Solid Waste Advisory Board'' for 8 of the years since its inception in 1990, a steering committee member of the ''New York City Recycling Advisory Board'' since its inception in 1990, and was a founding member of the NYC Waste Prevention Coalition. These are connected to efforts to clean up lower [[Manhattan]] from the effects of [[9/11]] and others to solid waste prevention and recycling. She has chaired and currently vice chairs the ''Municipal and Medical Waste Division of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association''. She co-founded and has been president of the ''Riverside-Inwood Neighborhood Garden (RING)'', a volunteer botanical garden in Upper Manhattan, since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finn|first1=Robin|title=Pilfered Peppers in City Gardens; Tomatoes, Too|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/nyregion/community-gardens-find-theft-is-a-fact-of-life.html?_r=0|website=Ny York Times|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Clem|title=Inwood's Dyckman St. is battleground between residents and businesses over noise|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/inwood-dyckman-st-battleground-residents-businesses-noise-article-1.118097|website=Ny Daily News|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10709">'''Matched molecular pair analysis''' ('''MMPA''') is a method in [[cheminformatics]] that compares the properties of two molecules that differ only by a single chemical transformation, such as the substitution of a hydrogen atom by a chlorine one. Such pairs of compounds are known as matched molecular pairs (MMP). Because the structural difference between the two molecules is small, any experimentally observed change in a physical or biological property between the matched molecular pair can more easily be interpreted. The term was first coined by Kenny and Sadowski in the book ''Chemoinformatics in Drug Discovery''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Peter W. | last1=Kenny | first2=Jens | last2=Sadowski | chapter=Chapter 11: Structure Modification in Chemical Databases | title=Chemoinformatics in Drug Discovery | editor1-first=Tudor I. | editor1-last=Oprea | publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA | year=2005 | pages=271–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

MMP can be defined as a pair of molecules that differ in only a minor single point change (See Fig 1). Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) are widely used in [[medicinal chemistry]] to study changes in compound properties which includes biological activity, toxicity, environmental hazards and much more, which are associated with well-defined structural modifications. Single point changes in the molecule pairs are termed a chemical transformation or Molecular transformation.  Each molecular pair is associated with a particular transformation. An example of transformation is the replacement of one functional group by another. More specifically, molecular transformation can be defined as the replacement of a molecular fragment having one, two or three attachment points with another fragment. Useful Molecular transformation in a specified context is termed as "Significant" transformations. For example, a transformation may systematically decrease or increase a desired property of chemical compounds. Transformations that affect a particular property/activity in a statistically significant sense are called as significant transformations. The transformation is considered significant, if it increases the property value "more often" than it decreases it or vice versa. Thus, the distribution of increasing and decreasing pairs should be significantly different from the binomial ("no effect") distribution with a particular p-value (usually 0.05).

==Significance of MMP based analysis==

MMP based analysis is an attractive method for computational analysis because they can be algorithmically generated and they make it possible to associate defined structural modifications at the level of compound pairs with chemical property changes, including biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Griffen | first1=Ed | last2=Leach | first2=Andrew G. | last3=Robb | first3=Graeme R. | last4=Warner | first4=Daniel J. | title=Matched molecular pairs as a medicinal chemistry tool | journal=[[J.

===Interpretable QSAR models===

MMPA is quite useful in the field of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] (QSAR) modelling studies. One of the issues of QSAR models is they are difficult to interpret in a chemically meaningful manner. While it can be pretty easy to interpret simple linear regression models, the most powerful [[algorithm]]s like [[neural network]]s, [[support vector machine]] are similar to "black boxes", which provide predictions that can't be easily interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Cumming et.al., Chemical predictive modelling to improve compound quality,Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 12, 948–962 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This problem undermines the applicability of QSAR model in helping the medicinal chemist to make the decision. If the compound is predicted to be active against some microorganism, what are the driving factors of its activity? Or if it is predicted to be inactive, how its activity can be modulated? The black box nature of the QSAR model prevents it from addressing these crucial issues. The use of predicted MMPs allows to interpret models and identify which MMPs were learned by the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sushko|first=Yurii|last2=Novotarskyi|first2=Sergii|last3=Körner|first3=Robert|last4=Vogt|first4=Joachim|last5=Abdelaziz|first5=Ahmed|last6=Tetko|first6=Igor V|date=2014-12-11|title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process|url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48|journal=Journal of Cheminformatics|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMPs, which were not reproduced by the model, could correspond to experimental errors or deficiency of the model (inappropriate descriptors, too few data, etc.). 

Analysis of MMPs (matched molecular pair) can be very useful for understanding the mechanism of action. A medicinal chemist might be interested particularly in "activity cliff". Activity cliff is a minor structural modification, which changes the target activity significantly.

===Activity Cliff===

Activity cliffs are minor structural modifications, with significant effect on molecular property. Activity cliffs usually have high SAR information content. Because small chemical changes in the set of similar compounds lead to large changes in activity. The assessment of activity cliffs requires careful consideration of similarity and potency difference criteria&lt;ref&gt;Stumpfe D, Bajorath J: Exploring activity cliffs in medicinal chemistry. J Med Chem. 2012; 55(7): 2932–2942 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22236250]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stumpfe D, Hu Y, Dimova D, et al.: Recent progress in understanding activity cliffs and their utility in medicinal chemistry. J Med Chem. 2014; 57(1): 18–28.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23981118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hu Y, Stumpfe D, Bajorath J: Advancing the activity cliff concept [v1; ref status: indexed, http://f1000r.es/1wf]. F1000Res. 2013; 2: 199.[https://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.2-199.v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of MMP based analysis==

Matched molecular pair (MMPA) analyses can be classified into two types: supervised and unsupervised MMPA.

===Supervised MMPA===

In supervised MMPA, the chemical transformations are predefined, then the corresponding matched pair compounds are found within the data set and the change in end point computed for each transformation.

===Unsupervised MMPA===

Also known as automated MMPAs. A [[machine learning]] algorithm is used to finds all possible matched pairs in a data set according to a set of predefined rules. This results in much larger numbers of matched pairs and unique transformations, which are typically filtered during the process to identify those transformations that correspond to statistically significant changes in the targeted property with a reasonable number of matched pairs.

== Matched molecular series==

Here instead of looking at the pair of molecules which differ only at one point, a series of more than 2  molecules different at a single point is considered. The concept of matching molecular series was introduced by Wawer and Bajorath.&lt;ref name="Local Structural Changes, Global Data Views: Graphical Substructure−Activity Relationship Trailing"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Mathias | last1=Wawer | first2=Jürgen | last2=Bajorath | title=Local Structural Changes, Global Data Views: Graphical Substructure−Activity Relationship Trailing | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=54 | issue=8 | pages=2944-2951 | year=2011 | pmid=21443196 | doi=10.1021/jm200026b | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm200026b}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that longer matched series is more likely to exhibit preferred molecular transformation while, matched pairs exhibit only a small preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Noel M. | last1=O'Boyle | first2=Jonas | last2=Boström | first3=Roger A. | last3=Sayle | first4=Adrian | last4=Gill | title=Using Matched Molecular Series as a Predictive Tool To Optimize Biological Activity | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=57 | issue=6 | pages=2704-2713 | year=2014 | pmid=24601597 | pmc=3968889 | doi=10.1021/jm500022q | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm500022q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The application of the MMPA across large chemical databases for the optimization of ligand potency is problematic because same structural transformation may increase or decrease or doesn't affect the potency of different compounds in the dataset. Selection of practical significant transformation from a dataset of molecules is a challenging issue in the MMPA. Moreover, the effect of a particular molecular transformation can significantly depend on the Chemical context of transformations.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, D. J., Bridgland-Taylor, M. H., Sefton, C. E. &amp; Wood, D. J. Prospective prediction of antitarget activity by matched molecular pairs analysis. Mol. Inform. 31, 365–368 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hajduk | first1=P.J. | last2=Sauer | first2=D.R. | title=Statistical analysis of the effects of common chemical substituents on ligand potency | journal=[[J. Med. Chem.]] | volume=51 | issue=3 | page=553–564 | year=2008 | pmid=18173228 | doi=10.1021/jm070838y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside these, MMPA might pose some limitations in terms of computational resources, especially when dealing with databases of compounds with a large number of breakable bonds. Further, more atoms in the variable part of the molecule also leads to combinatorial explosion problems. To deal with this, the number of breakable bonds and number of atoms in the variable part can be used to pre-filter the database.

:''This article is about the philosophical argument; for normal conditions in the sense of standards see the corresponding articles, e.g. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]].''

'''Normal conditions''' are a restriction on [[Philosophy|philosophical]] arguments, especially in [[epistemology]], in order to avoid objections perceived as digressive. As a reply to objections to an explanation of a [[phenomenon]], e.g. a [[hypothesis]] or a [[theory]], it is said, argument X holds [only] under normal conditions. In some cases, the concept of normal conditions tends to be rather blurred and the reply '''under normal conditions''' can tend to extend to everything that contradicts an argument. In cases, when the argument of normal conditions comes too often, according to the principle of [[Occam's Razor]] another explanation X' has to be found.

The term '''Norman architecture''' is used to categorise styles of [[Romanesque architecture]] developed by the [[Normans]] in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries. In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture.  The Normans introduced large numbers of [[castle]]s and [[fortification]]s  including Norman [[keep]]s, and at the same time [[monastery|monasteries]], [[abbey]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[cathedral]]s, in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded [[arch]]es (particularly over windows and doorways) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style.

==Origins==
These [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles originated in [[Normandy]] and became widespread in north western [[Europe]], particularly in [[England]], which contributed considerable development and has the largest number of surviving examples. At about the same time [[Hauteville family|a Norman dynasty]] ruled in [[Sicily]], producing a distinctive variation incorporating [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Saracen]] influences which is also known as Norman architecture, or alternatively as Sicilian Romanesque. Ancient Rome's invention of the arch is the basis of all Norman architecture.

The term may have originated with eighteenth-century [[antiquarian]]s, but its usage in a sequence of styles has been attributed to [[Thomas Rickman]] in his 1817 work ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' which used the labels "Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular". The more inclusive term ''romanesque'' was used of the [[Romance languages]] in English by 1715,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Romanesque": in French a letter of 1818 by [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien Duhérissier de Gerville]] seems to be the first&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries from 1819.&lt;ref&gt;OED same entry; in French by Gerville's friend [[Arcisse de Caumont]] in his ''Essaie sur l'architecture du moyen âge, particulièrement en Normandie,'' 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Edward the Confessor]] built [[Westminster Abbey]] in Romanesque style (now all replaced by later rebuildings) just before the Conquest, which is still believed to be the earliest major Romanesque building in England, no significant remaining Romanesque architecture in Britain can clearly be shown to predate the Conquest, although historians believe that many surviving "Norman" elements in buildings, nearly all churches, may well in fact be Anglo-Saxon.

==Norman arch==
[[File:Laon Cathedral Interior 04.JPG|thumb|The nave of [[Laon Cathedral]] resembles a Norman arch]]
The Norman arch is a defining point of Norman architecture. Grand [[arch]]ways are designed to evoke feelings of [[awe]] and are very commonly seen as the entrance to large [[religious]] buildings such as [[cathedral]]s.

==Normandy==
[[Viking]] invaders arrived at the mouth of the [[river Seine]] in 911, at a time when [[Franks]] were fighting on horseback and Frankish lords were building castles. Over the next century the population of the territory ceded to the Vikings, now called [[Normans]], adopted these customs as well as Christianity and the ''[[langue d'oïl]]''. Norman barons built timber castles on earthen mounds, beginning the development of [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and great stone churches in the Romanesque style of the Franks. By 950, they were building stone [[keep]]s. The Normans were among the most travelled peoples of Europe, exposing them to a wide variety of cultural influences which became incorporated in their art and architecture.  They elaborated on the early Christian basilica plan. Originally longitudinal with side aisles and an apse they began to add in towers, as at the Church of Saint-Étienne]] at Caen, in 1067. This would eventually form a model for the larger English [[cathedral]]s some 20 years later.

==England==

[[File:Norman arch.jpg|thumb |A Norman arch with zig-zag mouldings above the church doorway at [[Guiting Power]], [[Gloucestershire]]]]
In [[England]], Norman nobles and bishops had influence before the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and Norman influences affected late [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]]. [[Edward the Confessor]] was brought up in Normandy and in 1042 brought masons to work on the first Romanesque building in England, [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1051 he brought in Norman [[knight]]s who built "motte" castles as a defence against the [[Wales|Welsh]]. Following the invasion, Normans rapidly constructed [[motte-and-bailey]] castles along with  [[Church (building)|churches]], [[abbey]]s, and more elaborate [[fortification]]s such as Norman stone [[keep]]s.

The buildings show massive proportions in simple geometries using small bands of [[sculpture]]. Paying attention to the concentrated spaces of [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s and round doorways as well as the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] under an arch. The "Norman arch" is the rounded, often with mouldings carved or incised onto it for decoration. [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron patterns]], frequently termed "zig-zag [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]]", were a frequent signature of the Normans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Edward |title=ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC |journal=The Archaeological Review |date=December 1888 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=237-251 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44245200 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]]es often had deep [[chancel]]s and a square [[crossing tower]] which has remained a feature of English [[ecclesiastical architecture]]. Hundreds of [[parish]] churches were built and the great English [[cathedral]]s were founded from 1083.

After a fire damaged [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174 Norman masons introduced the new [[Gothic architecture]]. Around 1191 [[Wells Cathedral]] and [[Lincoln Cathedral]] brought in the English Gothic style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.

==Scotland==
[[Scotland]] also came under early Norman influence with Norman nobles at the court of King [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] around 1050. His successor [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Máel Coluim III]] overthrew him with English and Norman assistance, and his queen, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], encouraged the church. The [[Benedictine]] order founded a monastery at [[Dunfermline]]. Her sixth and youngest son, who became [[David I of Scotland|King David]], built [[St. Margaret's Chapel]] at the start of the 12th century.

==Ireland==
The Normans first landed in Ireland in 1169. Within five years earthwork castles were springing up, and in a further five, work was beginning on some of the earliest of the great stone castles. For example, [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] built a [[Motte-and-bailey]] castle on the site of the present day [[Trim Castle]], [[County Meath]], which was attacked and burned in 1173 by the Irish king [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]]. De Lacy, however, then constructed a stone castle in its place, which enclosed over three acres within its walls, and this could not be burned down by the Irish. The years between 1177 and 1310 saw the construction of some of the greatest of the Norman castles in Ireland. The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and among other buildings they constructed were [[Swords Castle]] in [[Fingal]] (North County Dublin), [[Dublin Castle]] and [[Carrickfergus Castle]] in [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Castles in Ireland Feudal Power in a Gaelic World. by Tom McNeill. (London, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-415-22853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

===Mezzogiorno===
The Normans began constructing castles, their trademark architectural piece, in Italy from an early date. [[William Iron Arm]] built one at an unidentified location (Stridula) in [[Calabria]] in 1045. After the death of [[Robert Guiscard]] in 1085, the [[Mezzogiorno]] (peninsular southern Italy) experienced a series of civil wars and fell under the control of increasingly weaker princes. Revolts characterised the region until well into the twelfth century and minor lords sought to resist ducal or royal power from within their own castles. In the [[Molise]], the Normans embarked on their most extensive castle-building programme and introduced the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' technique to Italy. Their clever use of the local stone artisans, together with the vast riches amassed from their enslaved population, made such tremendous feats possible. Some as majestic as those of the ancient Roman structures they tried to emulate.

Besides the [[encastellation]] of the countryside, the Normans erected several religious buildings which still survive. They edified the shrine at [[Monte Sant'Angelo]] and built a [[mausoleum]] to the [[Hauteville family]] at [[Venosa]]. They also built many new Latin monasteries, including the famous foundation of {{ill|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|lt=Sant'Eufemia|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlante.beniculturalicalabria.it/schede.php?id=178 |title=Abbazia Benedettina di Sant’ Eufemia |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of great importance are the portal of the [[Shrine of Mary Queen of Anglona]] and the ambulatory and radiating chapels of the [[Aversa Cathedral]]. In [[Salerno]], however, remember Fruscione Palace.

Here is a list of Norman architecture in the Mezzogiorno : 
* Castle of Circello. 
* Castle Monforte (Campobasso).

===Sicily===
{{further|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture}}
[[File:3420 - Catania - Absidi del duomo (1094) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 5-July-2008.jpg|thumbnail|The oldest Norman cathedral in Sicily (1094), the cathedral of Catania]]
[[File:Cefalu Cathedral interior BW 2012-10-11 12-07-53.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Cathedral of Cefalu]]]]
[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Cefalu]]]]
[[Sicily]]'s Norman period lasted from circa 1070 until about 1200.  The architecture was decorated in [[gilding|gild]]ed mosaics such as that at the cathedral at [[Monreale]].  The Palatine Chapel in [[Palermo]] built in 1130 is perhaps the strongest example of this. The interior of the [[dome]], (itself a Byzantine feature), is decorated in a [[mosaic]] depicting Christ Pantocrator accompanied by his [[angel]]s.

During Sicily's later Norman era early Gothic influences can be detected such as those in the [[Messina Cathedral|cathedral]] at Messina consecrated in 1197.  However, here the high Gothic [[campanile]] is of a later date and should not be confused with the early Gothic built during the Norman period; which featured pointed arches and windows rather than the [[flying buttress]]es and [[pinnacle]]s later to manifest themselves in the Gothic era.

===Malta===
After its Norman conquest in 1091, Malta saw the construction of several Norman pieces of architecture. Many have been demolished and rebuilt over the years (especially after the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]] which destroyed many old Norman buildings), however some fortresses and houses still exist in [[Mdina]] and [[Vittoriosa]].

==Transitional style==
As [[stone mason|master mason]]s developed the style and experimented with ways of overcoming the geometric difficulties of [[groin vault]]ed ceilings, they introduced features such as the pointed arch that were later characterised as being [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Architectural historians and scholars consider that a style must be assessed as an integral whole rather than an aggregate of features, and while some include these developments within the Norman or Romanesque styles, others describe them as transitional or "Norman–Gothic Transitional". A few websites use the term "Norman Gothic", but it is unclear whether they refer to the transitional style or to the Norman style as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Gothic-architecture.htm |title=Gothic Architecture in England |publisher=Britainexpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racine.ra.it/ungaretti/gothic/norman_gothic.htm |title=Norman Gothic |publisher=Racine.ra.it |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Norman==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Neo-Norman architecture is a type of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] based on Norman Romanesque architecture. There is sometimes confusion, especially in North America, between this style and revivalist versions of vernacular or later [[architecture of Normandy]], such as the "Norman farmhouse style" popular for larger houses.

Romanesque Revival versions focus on the arch and capitals, and decorated doorways.  There are two examples in Manchester: the former Stock Exchange building and a synagogue in [[Fallowfield]].

== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &amp;ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|deadurl = yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archivedate = 1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &amp;ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation &amp; life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="AAG"/&gt;

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &amp;ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &amp;ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &amp;ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &amp;ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny JBH et al. [http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621194350/http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} ''Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 | VOLUME 4''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climatology]] &amp;ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;Climate Prediction Center. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C Climate Glossary.] Retrieved on 2006-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &amp;ndash; study of soils in their natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |accessdate = 2006-06-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &amp;ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &amp;ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology.

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &amp;ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &amp;ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.&lt;ref name="AAG"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &amp;ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Children's geographies]] &amp;ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of focii within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &amp;ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &amp;ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &amp;ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
**# [[Linguistic geography]] &amp;ndash; deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pei, M. (1966). ''Glossary of linguistic terminology.'' New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1974). ''Linguistic change and diffusion: description and explanation in sociolinguistic dialect geography.''

* [[Development geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).
* [[Economic geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &amp;ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &amp;ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &amp;ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &amp;ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &amp;ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &amp;ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &amp;ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

* [[Qualitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[qualitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &amp;ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &amp;ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Supercontinents ====

[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|300px|Earth may have had a single supercontinent called "[[Pangaea]]"]]

[[List of supercontinents]]
A ''supercontinent'' is a [[landmass]] comprising more than one [[continent]]al core, or [[craton]].

*[[Afro-Eurasia]] ''(formed 5 million years ago)
*[[Americas]] ''(formed 15 million years ago)
*[[Eurasia]] ''(formed 60 million years ago)

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &amp;ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

* [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] 7.7 mil. km² (including [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and neighboring islands). The northern boundary of this zone is known as the [[Wallace line]].
* [[Neotropic]] 19.0 mil. km² (including [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]])
* [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]] 1.0 mil. km² (including [[Polynesia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Micronesia]])
* [[Antarctic ecozone|Antarctic]] 0.3 mil. km² (including [[Antarctica]]).

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &amp;ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &amp;ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Ecozone]] &amp;ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &amp;ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than an ecozone that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &amp;ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &amp;ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &amp;ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.
** {{annotated link|Village}} &amp;ndash; clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).
** {{annotated link|Town}} &amp;ndash; human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.
*** {{annotated link|Urban hierarchy}} &amp;ndash; ranks the structure of towns within an area.
**** {{annotated link|1st-order towns}} &amp;ndash; bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.
**** {{annotated link|2nd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|3rd-order towns}}

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

'''Pacific Open Learning Health Net''' ('''POLHN''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|h|ən}}) is a non-profit established in 2003, focused on [[distance education]]  for health professionals working in the Pacific. Since 2004, it has provided free online courses for [[continuing professional development]] in a wide range of health and science related disciplines.  These include self-directed, [[blended learning]], instructor-led and hybrid courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.polhncourses.org/oldmoodle|title=Former Courses|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.polhncourses.org/newmoodle|title=New Courses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform runs on a [[free and open-source software]] [[learning management system]]. POLHN works with several universities institutions and Ministries of Health to develop online health related courses guided by [[WHO]] publications and accepted [[standard operating procedure]].  Since 2013, the platform has resembled a typical [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) platform.

==History==

The [[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]) and Pacific Ministries of Health established POLHN in 2003 through funding provided by the Government of [[Japan]]. POLHN was established to address the need of [[health professionals]] in the Pacific to access [[continuing professional development]] (CPD) opportunities and up-to-date [[health information]]. POLHN fulfills these needs through an [[e-learning]] network across fourteen [[Pacific Island]] Countries, areas and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/southpacific/programmes/pacific_initiatives/polhn/en|title=Overview|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

POLHN provides access to sponsored and self-paced courses, news, application forms, and links to resources. The website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polhn.org|title=POLHN Website|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the main gateway to accessing courses, online resources, and health information. The website also contains information about POLHN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/about-polhn|title=POLHN website - about POLHN|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; information on learning centres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/learning-centres|title=POLHN website - Learning Centres}}&lt;/ref&gt; contact details for POLHN country coordinators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/team-profiles|title=POLHN website - Meet the Team|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; information on the availability of scholarships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/scholarships|title=POLHN website-scholarships|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and application forms for courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/forms|title=POLHN website-forms|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has partnerships with many organisations, allowing members to complete certification programs.  There are also general courses unrelated to any certification program, such as Patient Safety,  Risk Communications,  Diabetes, and Psycho-social Response in Humanitarian Disasters.  These take between 20 and 60 hours to complete, with automatic assessment of activities and exams.

Since its inception, POLHN has undergone various steps to expand and improve. These have included external reviews, for instance by the [[WHO Collaborating Centres|WHO Collaborating Centre]] at the [[University of Technology Sydney]] and Hezel Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hezel.com/what-we-ve-done/past-projects/226-who-wpro-pohln-nursing|title=Hezel Associates - WHO-WPRO Evaluation of POHLN Nursing Education (2010-2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===

POLHN has three main goals: 
# To provide access to quality, equitable, efficient and effective e-learning platforms that support health workers to maintain relevant skills and in so doing to enable countries to have a more sustainable and responsive skill mix;
# To assist regulatory and ministerial bodies to develop relevant policies for continuing professional development (CPD) of health workforces; and
# To support in building and sustaining the capacity of institutions to provide appropriate and accredited curricula through collaborative partnerships with health professionals, service providers, professional bodies, healthcare organisations, education and research entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/about-polhn|title=POLHN website - About us|work=polhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The POLHN community==

The POLHN platform facilitates learning through an interactive environment, where students can access information, communicate with students and teachers, and complete course modules and assessments. Over 30,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polhn.org/about-polhn|title=POLHN website}}&lt;/ref&gt; health workers have accessed POLHN across various cadres.

===Learning centres===

A key component of the POLHN community is its learning centres. These are physical locations where health workers in Pacific island countries can have easy access to courses. To date, POLHN has 54 internet connected learning and development centres in 15 Pacific island countries.

Learning centres are located in 14 countries: 
* [[American Samoa]];

Bern, Switzerland: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt;for quantifying an individual's impact on the environment via analysis of answers to an extensive quantity-based questionnaire that the individual fills out regarding their lifestyle.  The questions are arranged in six areas: home energy and water, transportation, consumerism, waste, advocacy, and demographics. 

==Conception==
Lotter, at the time a graduate student in ecology at the [[University of California, Davis]], developed the PEIA methodology while teaching a course on the History of Western Consciousness in the UC Davis Experimental College.  He realized that, while individuals in contemporary Western society generally have an enormous [[environmental impact]], there is very little awareness of it and no method for its quantification or [[environmental impact assessment|assessment]].

==Development==
The first software version of the PEIA methodology was the [[DOS]]-based EnviroAccount software, written in [[QuickBasic]] and completed in 1992. The basic PEIA algorithms were then transferred to [[Windows 3.1]] based EarthAware software, released in 1996.

EarthAware is still available for [http://donlotter.net/earthaware.html download] and runs on Windows 32-bit computers.

Lotter also authored a book on the topic, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Earthscore-Personal-Environmental-Audit-Guide/dp/0962906964 EarthScore: Your Personal Environmental Audit and Guide]''.

PEIA is similar in concept to the [[Ecological footprint]].

'''Pietra dura''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːtra ˈduːra|lang}}) or '''''pietre dure''''' {{IPA-it|ˈpjɛːtre ˈduːre|}} (see below), called '''parchin kari''' or '''parchinkari''' in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], is a term for the [[inlay]] technique of using cut and fitted, highly polished colored stones to create images. It is considered a [[decorative art]]. The stonework, after the work is assembled loosely, is glued stone-by-stone to a substrate after having previously been "sliced and cut in different shape sections; and then assembled together so precisely that the contact between each section was practically invisible". Stability was achieved by grooving the undersides of the stones so that they interlocked, rather like a jigsaw puzzle, with everything held tautly in place by an encircling 'frame'. Many different colored stones, particularly [[marble]]s, were used, along with [[semiprecious stone|semiprecious]], and even [[gemstone|precious stones]]. It first appeared in [[Rome]] in the 16th century, reaching its full maturity in [[Florence]].  Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones.  Typically, the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples where the image is in low [[relief]] were made, taking the work more into the area of [[hardstone carving]].

[[:wikt:pietra|Pietre]] [[:wikt:duro|dure]] is an Italian plural meaning "hard rocks" or [[hardstone]]s; the singular ''pietra dura'' is also encountered in Italian.  In Italian, but not in English, the term embraces all [[gem engraving]] and [[hardstone carving]], which is the artistic carving of three-dimensional objects in [[semi-precious]] stone, normally from a single piece, for example in [[Chinese jade]].  The traditional convention in English has been to use the singular ''pietra dura'' just to denote multi-colored inlay work.&lt;ref&gt;A distinction easily seen by comparing the [http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html |date=2011-01-09 }} and [http://www.firenzemusei.it/opificio/index.html Italian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014011118/http://www.firenzemusei.it/opificio/index.html |date=2009-10-14 }} versions of the website of the [[Opificio delle pietre dure]] in Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years there has been a trend to use ''pietre dure'' as a term for the same thing, but not for all of the techniques it covers, in Italian.&lt;ref name="Getty Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/3545/galleria-de'lavori-in-pietre-dure-italian-active-1588-present/ | title=Galleria de'Lavori in pietre dure | publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum | accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the title of a 2008 exhibition at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, ''Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe'' used the full Italian sense of the term, probably because they thought that it had greater brand recognition.  The material on the website speaks of objects such as a vase in [[lapis lazuli]] as being examples of "hardstone carving (''pietre dure'')"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/special/pietre_dure/more.asp Metropolitan Museum of Art] ''Art of the Royal Court: Treasures in Pietre Dure from the Palaces of Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London uses both versions on its website, but uses pietra dura ("A method of inlaying coloured marbles or semi-precious stones into a stone base, often in geometric or flower patterns....") in its "Glossary",&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.vam.ac.uk/vamembed/media/uploads/files/vanda-course-high_renaissance-glossary.pdf V&amp;A glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; which was evidently not consulted by the author of another page, where the reader is told: "Pietre dure (from the Italian 'hard stone') is made from finely sliced coloured stones, precisely matched, to create a pictorial scene or regular design".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/sculpture_features/caring_marble_plaster/marble_similar/index.html Is it Marble?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226161617/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/sculpture_features/caring_marble_plaster/marble_similar/index.html |date=2009-02-26 }} V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;  The English term "Florentine mosaic" is sometimes also encountered, probably developed by the tourist industry. Giovanni Montelatici (1864-1930) was an Italian Florentine artist whose brilliant work has been distributed across the world by tourists and collectors.

It is distinct from mosaic in that the component stones are mostly much larger and cut to a shape suiting their place in the image, not all of roughly equal size and shape as in mosaic. In pietra dura, the stones are not cemented together with [[grout]], and works in pietra dura are often portable.  Nor should it be confused with [[micromosaics]], a form of [[mosaic]] using very small [[tesserae]] of the same size to create images rather than decorative patterns, for [[Byzantine]] icons, and later for panels for setting into furniture and the like.

For fixed [[inlay]] work on walls, ceilings, and pavements that do not meet the definition for mosaic, the terms [[intarsia]] or [[cosmati]] work/[[cosmatesque]] are better used.  Similarly, for works that use larger pieces of stone (or tile), [[opus sectile]] may be used.  Pietre dure is essentially stone [[marquetry]].  As a high expression of [[lapidary]] art, it is closely related to the [[jewelery|jewelers art]].  It can also be seen as a branch of [[sculpture]] as three-dimensionality can be achieved, as with a [[bas relief]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010427064818/http://www.medici.org/hum/topics/pietredure.htm Medici.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pietra dura developed from the ancient Roman [[opus sectile]], which at least in terms of surviving examples, was architectural, used on floors and walls, with both geometric and figurative designs.  In the Middle Ages [[cosmatesque]] floors and small columns etc. on tombs and altars continued to use inlays of different colours in geometric patterns. [[Byzantine art]] continued with inlaid floors, but also produced some small religious figures in hardstone inlays, for example in the [[Pala d'Oro]] in [[San Marco, Venice]] (though this mainly uses [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]). In the [[Italian Renaissance]] this technique again was used for images.  The Florentines, who most fully developed the form, however, regarded it as 'painting in stone'.

As it developed in Florence, the technique was initially called ''opere di commessi'' (approximately, "Fitted together works"). [[Medici]] Grand Duke [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I]] of [[Tuscany]] founded the ''Galleria di'Lavori'' in 1588,&lt;ref name="Getty Center"/&gt; now the [[Opificio delle pietre dure]], for the purpose of developing this and other decorative forms.

A multitude of varied objects were created. Table tops were particularly prized, and these tend to be the largest specimens. Smaller items in the form of [[medallion]]s, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]s, wall [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]]s, panels inserted into doors or onto cabinets,  bowls, [[jardiniere]]s, garden ornaments, fountains, benches, etc. are all found. A popular form was to copy an existing painting, often of a human figure, as illustrated by the image of [[Pope Clement VIII]], above. Examples are found in many museums. The medium was transported to other European centers of court art and remained popular into the 19th century. In particular, [[Naples]] became a noted center of the craft. By the 20th century, the medium was in decline, in part by the assault of [[modernism]], and the craft had been reduced to mainly restoration work. In recent decades, however, the form has been revived, and receives state-funded sponsorship. Modern examples range from tourist-oriented [[kitsch]] including syrupy reproductions of 19th century style religious subjects (especially in Florence and Naples), to works copying or based on older designs used for luxurious decorative contexts, to works in a genuinely contemporary artistic idiom.

==Parchin kari==
By the early part of the 17th century, smaller objects produced by the Opificio were widely diffused throughout Europe, and as far East to the court of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in [[Indian art|India]], where the form was imitated and reinterpreted in a native style; its most sumptuous expression is found in the [[Taj Mahal]]. In Mughal India, pietra dura was known as ''Parchin kari'', literally 'inlay' or 'driven-in' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=10070 IJAR, vol. 1- Issue 1: The Notion of Hierarchy: The 'Parchin Kari' Programme at the Taj Mahal] ArchNet Islamic architecture library. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202160308/http://archnet.org/library/documents/one-document.tcl?document_id=10070 |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Taj Mahal being one of the major tourist attractions, there is a flourishing industry of Pietra Dura artifacts in Agra ranging from tabletops, medallions, elephants and other animal forms, jewellery boxes and other decorative items.  This art form is fully alive and thriving in Agra, India though the patterns in the designs are more Persian than Roman or Medician.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">'''Polymedia''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] notion that was introduced by  [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and Mirca Madianou&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Daniel and Madianou, M. (2012). Migration and New Media: Transnational Families and Polymedia. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the way most people today use a wide variety of [[Media (communication)|communication media]]. They claim that as individual communication acts are no longer dictated by access and cost, people are likely to be judged on why they selected one particular media rather than others, for example in breaking up a relationship.

Through [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]] on transnational familial communication, particularly between mothers and their children, Madianou and Miller found [[mediated communication]] does not take place over a single technology but by choosing among and commingling a variety of media technologies. According to Mirca Madianou and Daniel Miller, rather than relying on technological determinism “the situation of polymedia is one in which the media are mediated by the relationship as well as the other way around.”&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Daniel and Madianou, M. (2012). Migration and New Media: Transnational Families and Polymedia. London: Routledge, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding on the idea of polymedia, communication scholars Herbig, Herrmann, and Tyma extended the concept, not only as a social and technological practice, but as an important entry point for discussion in a “polymediated age.”  As they note, “The ‘poly’ in polymediation not only signifies the many forms that media take, but the many different interactions we can have with them.”&lt;ref name="Tyma_xx"&gt;Tyma, A, Herrmann, A. F., and Herbig, A. (2015). Introduction: The Beginnings: #WeNeedaWord. In Herbig, A., Herrmann, A. F., &amp; Tyma, A. W. (Eds). (2015). Beyond new media: Discourse and critique in a polymediated age. Lanham, MD:  Lexington Books, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also suggest that polymediation “is both the process and product resulting from media producers—who can be everyone and anyone with access—existing within a converged media state” that “moves beyond media convergence alone, by examining the simultaneous processes and outcomes of convergence and fragmentation" and "Since individuals can act as producers, audiences, and critics, the term polymediation can be utilized as a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb.”&lt;ref name="Tyma_xx"/&gt;

Similarly, according to Calka, polymediation has definitive characteristics: ubiquity, shape-shifting authorship, simultaneous fragmenting and merging of identity, and division/communality.&lt;ref&gt;Calka, Michelle (2015). Polymediation: The Relationship Between Self and Media. In Herbig, A., Herrmann, A. F., &amp; Tyma, A. W. (Eds). (2015). Beyond new media: Discourse and critique in a polymediated age. Lanham, MD:  Lexington Books, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/identity/13-523-future-identities-changing-identities-report.pdf Foresight], p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes polymedia as the way individuals configure a particular combination of media in their communication as an aspect of contemporary identity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2928">[[File:Abbaye Saint-Victor de Paris en 1655.png|thumb|Abbey of St. Victor, 1655]]
The '''school of St Victor''' was the medieval [[monastic school]] at the [[Augustinian]] [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|abbey of St Victor]]. The name also refers to the '''Victorines''', the group of philosophers and mystics based at this school as part of the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haren, ''Medieval Thought'' (1985), pp. 111-114&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in the twelfth century by [[Peter Abelard]]'s tutor and subsequent opponent, the realist school master [[William of Champeaux]], and a prominent early member of their community was [[Hugh of St Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferruolo, The Origins of the University, Stanford University Press 1985, {{ISBN|0-8047-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members were [[Achard of St. Victor]], [[Andrew of St Victor]], [[Richard of St Victor]], [[Walter of St Victor]] and [[Godfrey of St Victor]], as well as [[Thomas Gallus]].

Under the rigorous supervision of Hugh, St Victor offered a coherent and structured approach to learning through the cultivation of personal virtue rather than the requisition of knowledge for its own sake. This is exemplified in the schema for the [[liberal arts]] laid out in Hugh's ''Didascalicon'', in which he exhorts the reader to ''Omnia Disce'', or to know all. By 1160, the abbey had become a place of retreat from the schools, echoing the original act of weary retirement enacted by William of Champeaux at its founding. By the time of Godfrey, St Victor was primarily concerned with the instruction of its own canons, rather than the emphasis on the extern school operated earlier in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The end of the Victorines as a unique force came by 1173, when the reactionary Walter was appointed as prior. Walter launched a furious attack upon the intellectual culture of the school and its members with his ''Contra quatuor labyrinthos Francae'' (Against the Four Labyrinths of France), a denunciation of secular theological teaching. After this violent repudiation of Victorine pedagogical tradition the abbey was, in effect, a self-contained Augustinian priory like any other.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jan van Ruusbroec]] submitted his [[Groenendael Priory]] to their Rule in 1335, from which stemmed the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] and [[Thomas à Kempis]]' [[Devotio Moderna]]. A major theme of their studies was the anagogical relationship between the Divine and the Mundane, adopted by Pope Eugene IV in his 5.1.1435 bull&lt;ref&gt;Belgian National Archives, Anderlecht, Fonds Ecclesiastique&lt;/ref&gt; declaring Roman supremacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11119">{{short description|The area of sea ice relative to the total area at a given point in the ocean}}
'''Sea ice concentration''' is a useful variable for [[climatology|climate]]
scientists and nautical [[navigators]].  It is defined as the area of
[[sea ice]] relative to the total at a given point in the [[ocean]].
This article will deal primarily with its determination from [[remote sensing]] measurements.

==Significance==

Sea ice concentration helps determine a number of other important climate
variables.  Since the [[albedo]] of ice is much higher than that of water,
ice concentration will regulate [[insolation]] in the polar oceans.
When combined with [[sea ice thickness|ice thickness]], it determines
several other important [[flux]]es between the air and sea,
such as salt and fresh-water fluxes between the polar oceans
(see for instance [[bottom water]]) as well as
[[heat flux|heat transfer]] between the atmosphere.
Maps of sea ice concentration can be used to determine
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice area|ice area]] and
[[Measurement of sea ice#ice extent|ice extent]], both of which are important
markers of [[climate change]].

Ice concentration charts are also used by navigators to determine
potentially passable regions—see [[icebreaker]].

==Methods==

===In situ===

Measurements from ships and aircraft are based on simply calculating
the relative area of ice versus water visible within the scene.
This can be done using photographs or by eye.
In situ measurements are used to validate remote sensing
measurements.

===SAR and visible===

Both [[synthetic aperture radar]] and visible sensors (such as [[Landsat]])
are normally high enough resolution that each pixel is simply classified
as a distinct surface type, i.e. water versus ice.  The concentration can then be
determined by counting the number of ice pixels in a given area which
is useful for validating concentration estimates from lower resolution
instruments such as microwave radiometers.  Since SAR images are normally
monochrome and the [[backscatter]] of ice can vary quite considerably,
classification is normally done based on texture using groups of
pixels—see [[pattern recognition]].

Visible sensors have the disadvantage of being quite weather sensitive—images are obscured by clouds—while SAR sensors, especially in the
higher resolution modes, have a limited coverage and must be pointed.
This is why the tool of choice for determining ice concentration is
often a passive microwave sensor.

===Microwave radiometry===
[[File:Oldest Arctic Sea Ice is Disappearing.png|left|thumb|Arctic sea ice coverage in 1980 (bottom) and 2012 (top), as observed by passive microwave sensors on NASA’s Nimbus-7 satellite and by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Multi-year ice is shown in bright white, while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white. The data shows the ice cover for the period of 1 November through 31 January in their respective years.]]
All warm bodies emit electro-magnetic radiation: see [[thermal radiation]].
Since different objects will emit differently at different frequencies,
we can often determine what type of object we are looking at based on its emitted
radiation—see [[spectroscopy]].  This principle underlies all ''passive''
microwave sensors and most passive infrared sensors.  Passive is used in the
sense that the sensor only measures radiation that has been emitted by other
objects but does not emit any of its own.
(A SAR sensor, by contrast, is ''active''.) [[SSMR]] and [[SSMI]] radiometers were flown on the [[Nimbus program]] and [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series of satellites.

Because clouds are translucent in the microwave regime, especially
at lower frequencies, microwave radiometers are quite weather insensitive.
Since most microwave radiometers operate along a [[polar orbit]] with
a broad, sweeping scan, full ice maps of the polar regions where
the swaths are largely overlapping can usually be obtained within one day.
This frequency and reliability comes at the cost of a poor resolution:
the angular [[field of view]] of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] is directly
[[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[wavelength]]
and inversely proportional to the effective [[aperture]] area.
Thus we need a large deflector dish to compensate for a low frequency
.&lt;ref name="Ulaby_etal1986"/&gt;

Most ice concentration algorithms based on microwave radiometry
are predicated on the dual observation that: 1. different surface types
have different, strongly clustered, microwave signatures and
2. the radiometric signature at the instrument head is a linear
combination of that of the different surface types, with the weights
taking on the values of the relative concentrations.
If we form a vector space from each of the instrument channels
in which all but one of the signatures of the different surface types
are linearly independent, then it is straightforward to solve for
the relative concentrations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec T_b = \vec T_{b0} + \sum_{i=1}^n(\vec T_{bi} - \vec T_{b0})C_i
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec T_b&lt;/math&gt; is the radiometric signature at the
instrument head (normally measured as a [[brightness temperature]]),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{b0}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the nominal
background surface type (normally water),
&lt;math&gt;\vec T_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the signature of the ''i''th
surface type while ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the relative
concentrations.

Every operational ice concentration algorithm is predicated on this
principle or a slight variation.
The NASA team algorithm, for instance, works by taking the
difference of two channels and dividing by their sum.
This makes the retrieval slightly [[nonlinear]], but with
the advantage that the influence of temperature is mitigated.
This is because brightness temperature varies roughly linearly
with physical temperature when all other things are equal—see [[emissivity]]—and because the sea ice emissivity at different microwave
channels is strongly correlated.&lt;ref name="Rothrock_etal1988"/&gt;
As the equation suggests, concentrations of multiple ice
types can potentially be detected, with NASA team distinguishing between
first-year and multi-year ice (see image above).

Accuracies of sea ice concentration derived from passive microwave sensors may be expected to be on the order of 5\% (absolute).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of factors act to reduce the accuracy of the retrievals, the most obvious being variations in the microwave signatures produced by a given surface type.
For sea ice, the presence of snow, variations in salt and moisture content, the presence of melt ponds as well as variations in surface temperature will all produce strong variations in the microwave signature of a given ice type.  New and thin ice in particular will often have a microwave signature closer to that of open water.  This is normally because of its high salt content, not because of radiation being transmitted from the water through the ice—see [[sea ice emissivity modelling]].
The presence of waves and surface roughness will change the signature over open water.  Adverse weather conditions, [[clouds]] and [[humidity]] in particular, will also tend to reduce the accuracy of retrievals.&lt;ref name="smos_final"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6777">'''Shona music''' is the [[music]] of the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]]. There are several different types of traditional Shona music including [[mbira]], [[singing]], [[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]] and [[drum (musical instrument)|drumming]].  Very often, this music will be accompanied by [[dance|dancing]], and participation by the audience.  In Shona music, there is little distinction between the performer and the audience, both are often actively involved in the music-making, and both are important in the religious ceremonies where Shona Music is often heard.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Mbira==
[[Image:Mbira dzavadzimu.jpg|thumb|An [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]]]]
{{Main|Mbira}}

The mbira is a traditional instrument of the Shona People often used in religious ceremonies.  There are several different varieties of mbira including the [[Mbira#Mbira dzavadzimu|Mbira Dzavadzimu]] and [[Mbira#Mbira Nyunga Nyunga|Mbira Nyunga Nyunga]].

Shona music is well known as representative of mbira ("thumb piano") music. The performer of the "[[kushaura]]" (lead mbira part) often acts also as the lead vocalist, selecting a known melody or mbira pattern to accompany selected lyrics, usually a phrase or a few lines of text which are then commented upon improvisationally. The performer of the "kutsinira" (second mbira part) plays a pattern which interlocks with the "kushaura" in a way that creates the repeated notes which identify mbira music. The "kutsinira" part is sometimes the same part as the "kushaura", but following the kushaura one pulse behind. The mbira players are accompanied by another less active singer who plays the [[hosho (instrument)|hosho]] (a rattle) and responds to the improvised lyrics of the singer and, most importantly, embellishes and complements the lead vocal melody. (Garfias 1971){{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Drumming==
Drums are always associated with dance and can be used for various dances.

===Mhande Drums===
# [[Shauro]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Tsinhiro]]- used for the response rhythm

===Dinhe Drums===
# [[Mhito]]- used for the lead rhythm
# [[Mitumba miviri]]- used for the response rhythm

===Chokoto Drums===
(these are two headed)
# [[Chimudumbana]]- small, for lead rhythm
# [[Chigubha]]- big, for response rhythm

==Hosho==
[[Image:Hosho instrument.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]]]]
{{Main|Hosho (instrument)}}

Shona music is often accompanied by the '''[[Hosho (instrument)|hosho]]''', a hollowed-out maranka gourd containing ''hota'' seeds or other objects that is shaken to generate a sound.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

== Ancient Shona Music ==
Traditional ancient Shona musics consist of [[Mbira dzavadzimu]] played by multiple players, [[Hosho (instrument)|Hosho]] and [[Ngoma drums]].Ancient shona music is mainly played at spiritual ceremonies called Bira.

==Modern==
Traditional Shona music has been adapted to modern instruments such as electric guitars and western drumsets, for example by musicians such as [[Thomas Mapfumo]], [[Stella Chiweshe]], and [[Oliver Mtukudzi]]. This music is also associated with the [[Chimurenga]] movement.{{cn|date =October 2017}}

==Shona music in the West==
Shona music has become popular in the West and even in the East such as Japan.  In the United States, Shona music has become popular in Colorado, California, the Pacific Northwest and in some places of Argentina, largely due to the seeding influence of musicians such as [[Dumisani Maraire]], [[Ephat Mujuru]], Thomas Mapfumo and [[Erica Azim]].{{cn|date =October 2017}}

===Shona music on Marimba===
Shona marimbas are diatonic and are made with F#'s and without. They are different from other marimbas through their larger keys and resonators beneath the keys (to produce a buzzing sound). Often traditional mbira songs are translated to the marimba.

'''Situational strength''' is defined as cues provided by environmental forces regarding the desirability of potential behaviors.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's [[Personality type|personality]], they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, [[extraversion]], risk-taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of [[individual differences]] in terms of actual behaviors.

==Contrasting strong and weak situations==
An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.

In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop.

==Origins and history==
Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in [[psychology]], work conducted by [[Carl Rogers]] suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist.&lt;ref name="rogers-1954"/&gt; Additionally, [[Stanley Milgram]] argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions.&lt;ref name="milgram-1965"/&gt; However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of [[Walter Mischel]]. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, ''Personality and Assessment'', where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics.&lt;ref name="mischel-1968"/&gt; It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been.&lt;ref name="mischel-1999"/&gt;

In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological "situations" and "treatments" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior "when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation" (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as "situational strength" (or "situation strength").

Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt;

==Modern conceptualization and empirical verification==
Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed:&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength.
# Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others.
# If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet-based effects occur.

Four facets of situational strength have been identified:
# Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand.
# Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other.
# Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control.
# Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity.

In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting [[meta-analysis]], it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the [[effect size]] of the interaction effect was reasonably large.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;

==Implications==
Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mischel-1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins-cummings-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-adler-1984"/&gt; This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness–performance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-bonaccio-2009"/&gt;

Another important implication revolves around the idea of [[person-environment fit]]. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health.&lt;ref name="kristofbrown-zimmerman-johnson-2005"/&gt; Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing.

==Future directions==
Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study:
# It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order "to analyze the context within which the job is embedded" (page 349).&lt;ref name="murphy-dzieweczynski-2005"/&gt; There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait-outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature—the absence of which has been noted.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt; Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question.&lt;ref name="azen-budescu-2003"/&gt; Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions [[interaction|interact]] with each other—and, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1443">'''Soil defertilisation''' refers to the practice of reducing [[soil fertility]] in order to reduce the number of plants that can grow on that soil. It is often done on land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks.

== Benefit ==
On land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks or other communal spaces, undesired plants (weeds) can become a nuisance to the city's communal services, costing effort and money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In some cases, along with soil defertilisation, the soil's pH and water content can be altered. This may create a much different environment, allowing more specialised plants/vegetation to grow and take hold.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== In practice ==
Soil defertilisation is done by growing [[Green_manure|specific cover crops]] (e.g., ''[[Phacelia]]'', ''[[White mustard|Sinapis alba]]'', ''[[Lolium multiflorum]]'') on them and then, instead of ploughing them under, removing them from the soil. By doing this, the nutrients that have accumulated in the crops are removed together with the crops. The crops may be used on other land that needs to be [[Fertilizer|fertilsed]] (instead of defertilised), for example agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Stappen naar een ecologische tuin: aanleg en beheer by Geertje Coremans, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sothic cycle''' or '''Canicular period''' is a period of 1,461 [[Egyptian civil year]]s of 365 days each or 1,460 [[Julian calendar|Julian years]] averaging 365¼ days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the [[heliacal rising]] of the star [[Sirius]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}} or ''[[Sopdet]]'', "Triangle"; {{lang-grc-gre|Σῶθις}}, ''Sō̂this'') on 19 July in the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The date slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is an important aspect of [[Egyptology]], particularly with regard to reconstructions of the [[Egyptian calendar]] and its history. [[Egyptian astronomy|Astronomical records]] of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

==Mechanics==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian calendar|civil year]], its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the [[heliacal rising|return]] of the bright star [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]] to the night sky was considered to herald the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate [[leap year]]s until 22{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, its months "wandered" backwards through the [[solar year]] at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the {{nowrap|'''Sothic year'''}} as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].)&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sidereal year]] of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the [[ecliptic]] (the apparent path of the [[Sun]] across the sky), whereas Sirius's displacement ~40˚ below the ecliptic, its [[proper motion]], and the wobbling of the [[celestial equator]] cause the period between its [[heliacal rising]]s to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the "wandering" day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 civil or 1460 Julian years.

==Discovery==
This cycle was first noticed by [[Eduard Meyer]] in 1904, who then carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of the [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by [[Censorinus]] as having happened on the Egyptian New Year's Day between {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 and 142.&lt;ref name=Kitchen&gt;Kitchen, K. A. ''The Chronology of Ancient Egypt.'' p.205. World Archaeology,  Vol. 23, No. 2 (October 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The record actually refers to 21{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140 but is astronomically calculated as a definite 20{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. Leap day occurs in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140, and so the new year on 1{{nbsp}}[[Thoth (month)|Thoth]] is 20{{nbsp}}July in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 but it is 19{{nbsp}}July for {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140-142. Thus he was able to compare the day on which Sirius rose in the Egyptian calendar to the day on which Sirius ought to have risen in the Julian calendar, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation. One also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs, and mislocating an observation can potentially change the resulting chronology by several decades.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; (Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]],&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.)&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075421/http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |archivedate=2017-02-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer concluded from an ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] that the Egyptian civil calendar was created in [[5th millennium BC|4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} a date that appears in a number of old books. But research and discoveries have since shown that the [[first dynasty of Egypt]] did not begin before {{nowrap|c. [[4th millennium BC|3100 {{sc|bc}}]]}}, and the claim that 19{{nbsp}}July 4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} is the "earliest fixed date" has since been discredited. Most scholars either move the observation upon which he based this forward by one cycle of Sirius to 19{{nbsp}}July 2781{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} or reject the assumption that the document in question indicates a rise of Sirius at all.&lt;ref name=Grimal&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.52. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological interpretation==
Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.51. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date is too late for Djer's reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian ''lunar'' calendar, instead of the solar civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value.&lt;ref name=Grimal/&gt;
A newly discovered Sothis-date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18741665-12340035 Gautschy et al. 2017 A New Astronomically Based Chronological Model for the Egyptian Old Kingdom]

The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of [[Senusret III]]. This observation was almost certainly made at [[Itj-Tawy]], the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991-1778{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), [[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] reduces it to 206 years (1991-1785{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), based on 17{{nbsp}}July 1872{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker's investigation of lunar dates the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007-1794{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 21 July 1888{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year, and then as 2003-1790{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 20 July 1884{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year.

The third observation was in the reign of [[Amenhotep I]], and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be expanded by some 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.202. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational mechanics and precession==
The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula 1/a + 1/b = 1/t or half the [[harmonic mean]]. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. 

The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to [[axial precession]],&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, M. F. "The Length of the Sothic Cycle", ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', '''55''' (1969), p. 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility. Throughout the year the star will rise approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to its same relative location at sunrise. This length of time can be called an observational year. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will on average exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed.

The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration was exactly 365.25 days in the early {{nowrap|4th millennium {{sc|bc}}&lt;ref&gt;SkyCharts III&lt;/ref&gt;}} before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The 1461 value could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation.

It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the [[precession of the equinox]]. Professor [[Jed Buchwald]] wrote "Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes—and so from the solstices—throughout these many centuries, despite precession." &lt;ref&gt;Buchwald, Jed Z. (2003), [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4096/1/Egyptian.pdf "Egyptian Stars under Paris Skies"], ''Engineering and Science'' (Caltech), 66 (4) (2003) 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the helical rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do but much slower.&lt;ref&gt;One day per 120 years, see Winlock H., ''Origin of the Ancient Egyptian Calendar'', Proc. of the Am. Philosophical Soc., '''83''' (1940): 447-64.&lt;/ref&gt; This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about the 20th of July, that is a month later after the summer solstice.

==Problems and criticisms==
Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt;

A number of criticisms have been leveled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic.  Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation.  Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless.  Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn't merit mention or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery.

One recent popular history of the Ancient Near East by Marc Van De Mierop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and believes that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE. &lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop ''A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000–323 B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some have recently claimed that the [[Theran eruption]] marks the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] due to Theran ash and pumice discoveries in the ruins of [[Avaris]] in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Because the evidence of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BC, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50–80 years at the outset of the 18th dynasty{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Claims that the Thera eruption is the subject of the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritner|first=Robert K|author2=Moeller, Nadine |title=The Ahmose ‘Tempest Stela’, Thera and Comparative Chronology|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=2014|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1086/675069|jstor=10.1086/675069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been disputed by writers such as [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Centuries of Darkness'' (London, 1991: [http://www.centuries.co.uk/index.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction''' (SPIE) system was developed as a means to rapidly insert and/or extract a [[reconnaissance]] [[patrol]] from an area that does not permit a helicopter to land.  SPIE has application for rough terrain as well as water inserts/extracts. It is an adaptation of the [[Vietnam War]]-era [[STABO]] rig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the SPIE rope is lowered into the pickup area from a hovering helicopter.  Patrol personnel, each wearing a harness with an attached [[carabiner]], hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope.  A second safety line is attached to a second D-ring located above the first.  The helicopter lifts vertically from an extract zone until the rope and personnel are clear of obstructions, then proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone.  The rope and personnel are treated as an external load and airspeeds, altitudes, and oscillations must be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;FMFM 7-40 Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Operations&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Coast Guard]] uses a similar technique to board ships when speed and stealth are required.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
The Special Personnel Insertion/Extraction was first designed by the Marines of [[1st Force Reconnaissance Company]], the Marine division's [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] riggers.  They created and combat tested several versions of the SPIE before it was officially recommended to be tested.  In May 1970, the commanding general of [[3rd Marine Expeditionary Force|3rd Marine Amphibious Force]] coordinated input from the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] and his [[1st Marine Air Wing]].  A request was sent to the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and to the Development Center for certification of the SPIE rig and to its safety and use.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 1stFORECON"&gt;Bruce F. Meyers, ''Fortune Favors the Brave: The Story of First Force Recon,'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The parachute test jumpers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) and Marine Corps, all qualified parachutist designers and engineers, assembled together at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|El Centro]] for the initial testing and evaluation of the SPIE rig.  After a few test dummies were tried, Marine Major Bruce F. Meyers, along with four Navy NPU parachutist engineers, successfully attempted the first flight on the SPIE assembly.

'''Structural complexity''' is a science of [[applied mathematics]], that aims at relating fundamental physical or biological aspects of a [[complex system]] with the mathematical description of the morphological complexity that the system exhibits, by establishing rigorous relations between mathematical and physical properties of such system (Ricca 2005). 

Structural complexity emerges from all systems that display morphological organization (Nicolis &amp; Prigogine 1989). Filamentary structures, for instance, are an example of [[Lagrangian_coherent_structures |coherent structures]] that emerge, interact and evolve in many physical and biological systems, such as mass distribution in the [[Shape of the universe|Universe]], [[Vortex |vortex filaments]] in turbulent flows, [[neural networks]] in our brain and genetic material (such as [[DNA]]) in a cell. In general information on the degree of morphological [[Order_and_disorder_(physics) |disorder]] present in the system tells us something important about fundamental physical or biological processes.

Structural complexity methods are based on applications of [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] (and in particular [[knot theory]]) to interpret physical properties of [[dynamical systems]] (Abraham &amp; Shaw 1992; Ricca 2009), such as relations between [[kinetic energy]] and tangles of vortex filaments in a turbulent flow or [[magnetic energy]] and braiding of magnetic fields in the solar corona, including aspects of [[topological fluid dynamics]].

== Surface engineering ==

[[Surface engineering]] is the sub-discipline of [[materials science]] which deals with the surface of solid matter.  It has applications to [[chemistry]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]] (particularly in relation to [[semiconductor manufacturing]]).

[[Solids]] are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which bounds the bulk material is called the [[Surface phase]]. It acts as an interface to the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the [[Bulk phase]].

The surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This interaction can degrade the surface phase over time. Environmental degradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by [[wear]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Surface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in order to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the surface robust to the environment in which it will be used.

===Applications and Future of Surface Engineering===

Surface engineering techniques are being used in the automotive, aerospace, missile, power, electronic, biomedical,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; textile, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, steel, power, cement, machine tools, construction industries. Surface engineering techniques can be used to develop a wide range of functional properties, including physical, chemical, electrical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant properties at the required substrate surfaces.  Almost all types of materials, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites can be coated on similar or dissimilar materials.  It  is also possible to form coatings of newer materials (e.g., met glass. beta-C3N4), graded deposits, multi-component deposits etc.

In 1995, surface engineering was a ₤10 billion market in the United Kingdom. Coatings, to make surface life robust from wear and corrosion, was approximately half the market.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Functionalization of Antimicrobial Surfaces]] is a unique technology that can be used for sterilization in health industry, self-cleaning surfaces and protection from bio films.

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in surface engineering from age-old electroplating to processes such as vapor phase deposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Ilona Kretzschmar |title=Template-Assisted GLAD: Approach to Single and Multipatch Patchy Particles with Controlled Patch Shape|journal=Langmuir|date=6 December 2013|volume=29|issue=51|pages=15755–15761|doi=10.1021/la404592z|pmid=24313824}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Zhenping|author2=Kretzschmar, Ilona |title=Template-Assisted Fabrication of Patchy Particles with Uniform Patches|journal=Langmuir|date=3 June 2012|volume=28|issue=26|pages=9915–9919|doi=10.1021/la3017563|pmid=22708736}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffusion, thermal spray &amp; welding using advanced heat sources like plasma,&lt;ref name="vacuum2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; laser, ion, electron, microwave, solar beams, synchrotron radiation,&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt; pulsed arc, pulsed combustion, spark, friction and induction.

It's estimated that loss due to wear and corrosion in the US is approximately $500 billion. In the US, there are around 9524 establishments (including automotive, aircraft, power and construction industries) who depend on engineered surfaces with support from 23,466 industries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Surface functionalization ==

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''Surface functionalization''' introduces chemical [[functional group]]s to a surface. This way, materials with functional groups on their surfaces can be designed from substrates with standard bulk material properties. Prominent examples can be found in semiconductor industry and biomaterial research.&lt;ref name="synthesis2010"/&gt;

=== Polymer Surface Functionalization ===

[[Plasma processing]] technologies are successfully employed for polymers surface functionalization.

'''The ''Tenjukoku Shūchō'' Mandala''' ({{nihongo|天寿国繍帳}}) is a Japanese work of [[textile art]]. It is the oldest known example of [[embroidery]] in Japan, dating back to 622 CE. It was created in honour of [[Prince Shōtoku]], one of the earliest proponents of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="DeaconCalvin2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deborah A.

==Creation==

In the ''[[Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu]]'', it is recorded that Tachibana no Ōiratsume, one of the widows of Prince Shōtoku, commissioned the [[mandala]] after her husband's death, to represent the heavenly realm to which he had departed so that she could envision his afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=尼門跡寺院の世界: 皇女たちの信仰と御所文化|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6AYAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=産経新聞社|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork was created by maidservants of the Imperial Court, with the permission of the Empress Suiko.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt; The original was stitched in silk on a series of large square curtains, approximately {{convert|5|m|ft}} across,&lt;ref name="meeks2007"/&gt; but only a small portion of this, measuring approximately {{convert|89|cm|in}} by {{convert|83|cm|in}}, still survives.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis Granoff|author2=Koichi Shinohara|title=Images in Asian Religions: Text and Contexts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f22MMuUrOaUC&amp;pg=PA261|date=1 October 2010|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5980-6|page=261–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidder1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidder|first1=J. Edward Jr|title=The Fujinoki Sarcophagus|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|date=1989|volume=44|issue=4|pages=415–460|doi=10.2307/2384537|jstor=2384537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replica and current version==

The mandala is held at the [[Nara National Museum]], but remains the property of the [[Chūgū-ji]] temple in [[Nara Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"/&gt; The extant version was created in the [[Edo period]] by combining remnants of the original embroidery with a replica made in the late 13th century.&lt;ref name="tnm"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tenjukoku Shucho Mandara and the Statue of Prince Shotoku|url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=242&amp;lang=en|publisher=Tokyo National Museum|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its association with the temple and its reconstruction are due to the work of the [[Bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] [[Shinnyo]], who recovered the original mandala from its storage at [[Hōryū-ji]] in 1273. According to the narratives of Shinnyo's life, she had a dream in which she learned that the mandala contained the death date of the {{nihongo|Princess Anahobe no Hashihito|穴穂部間人皇女|Anahobe no Hashihito no Himemiko}}, consort of [[Emperor Jomei]] and mother of Shōtoku (Shinnyo was researching Hashihito, the patroness of Chūgū-ji, as part of her work to restore the temple). The mandala was locked away at Hōryū-ji, but a break-in at the Hōryū-ji treasury allowed Shinnyo to access their stores under the pretext of checking for damages. There, she found the mandala, severely damaged, and was given permission to remove it to Chūgū-ji. She subsequently took it on a fund-raising tour to Kyoto, and received enough donations to fund the creation of a replica.&lt;ref name="meeks2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meeks|first1=Lori R.|title=In Her Likeness: Female Divinity and Leadership at Medieval Chūgūji|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=2007|volume=34|issue=2|pages=351–392|jstor=30233816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the replica and the original were damaged by fires at Chūgū-ji in the early fourteenth century, but the damaged pieces were preserved and in the nineteenth century were combined together to create the current version.&lt;ref name="delrosariopradel"/&gt; The colour fastness of the original material was superior to that of the later replica; in the extant version of the artwork, the brighter sections are all derived from the original.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kidder1989"/&gt;

==Content==

The mandala depicts the Buddhist realm of Tenjukoku ({{nihongo|天寿国}}), or the "Land of Infinite Life", and presents a number of different elements representing various Buddhist concepts. The building in the bottom right is assumed by most scholars to represent the heavenly palace of Zenpōdō from the ''[[Maitreya]] [[Sutra]]''. The main pattern of tortoises contains characters spelling the names of Shōtoku, Hashihito and Ōiratsume, arranged as a Buddhist [[Triple deity|triad]],&lt;ref name="mita"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mita|first1=Kakuyuki|title=On the Original Form of the Tenjukoku-shûchô and its Subject|url=http://www.bijutsushi.jp/pdf-files/ronbunshou/english/Jahs09-6MitaSar.pdf|website=Bijutsushi|publisher=Japan Art History Society|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents Shōtoku's genealogy; other tortoises contain further characters recorded in the ''Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu'', including the death dates of Shōtoku and his mother, and the story of the mandala's creation.&lt;ref name="Lee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Doo Young Lee|title=Prince and the Monk, The: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Xnk04cEGIC&amp;pg=PA93|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8046-5|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of the work contained 100 such tortoises.&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt; An inscription, purportedly a statement by Shōtoku, was originally appended: "The world is folly. Only the Buddha is real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenjukoku Shucho|url=http://www.trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/clothing-undergarment/individual-textiles-and-textile-types/religious-representations/tenjukoku-shucho|publisher=Lieden Textile Research Centre|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original base fabric on which the images are embroidered is a woven purple [[gauze]], which may have been imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple [[twill]] or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are [[Yarn#Structure|z-twisted]] ([[Rope#Styles of rope construction|right laid]]) and are sewn exclusively in [[backstitch]] while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn may be one of the reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.&lt;ref name="delrosariopradel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pradel|first1=Maria del Rosario|title=The Tenjukoku Shucho and the Asuka Period Funerary Practices|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1874&amp;context=tsaconf|website=Textile Society of America|publisher=University of Nebraska|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers argue that the similarity of the mandala's iconography to Chinese and Korean funeral monuments, together with the gauze fabric on which it was originally stitched, indicate that it is not in fact a Buddhist artefact. This theory suggests that the artwork does not represent Tenjukoku, but rather constitutes a record of the memorial rites performed for Shōtoku, and that the association with Buddhism was a later development.&lt;ref name="Lee2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pradel2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pradel|first1=Chari|title=Fabricating the Tenjukoku Shūchō Mandara and Prince Shōtoku’s Afterlives|date=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004182608|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/fabricating-tenjukoku-shucho-mandara-and-prince-shotokus-afterlives|accessdate=22 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518100946/http://www.brill.com/products/book/fabricating-tenjukoku-shucho-mandara-and-prince-shotokus-afterlives|archive-date=2017-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pradel3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pradel|first1=Maria del Rosario|title=The fragments of the Tenjukoku shūchō mandara : reconstruction of the iconography and the historical contexts|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3852027|website=HKUL|publisher=University of Hong Kong|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Concept of Law.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Concept of Law''''' ({{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}) is the most famous work of the [[legal philosophy|legal philosopher]] [[H. L. A. Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.angelfire.com/md2/timewarp/hart.html|title = H.L.A. Hart’s The Concept of Law|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first published in 1961 and develops Hart's theory of [[legal positivism]] (the view that laws are rules made by human beings and that there is no inherent or necessary connection between law and [[morality]]) within the framework of [[analytic philosophy]].  In this work, Hart sets out to write an essay of descriptive [[sociology]] and [[analytical jurisprudence]].  ''The Concept of Law'' provides an explanation to a number of traditional jurisprudential questions such as "what is law?", "must laws be rules?", and "what is the relation between law and morality?".  Hart answers these by placing law into a social context while at the same time leaving the capability for rigorous analysis of legal terms, which in effect "awakened English jurisprudence from its comfortable slumbers".&lt;ref name="Postema"&gt;{{cite book|last=Postema|first=Gerald|title=Legal Philosophy in the Twentieth Century: The Common Law World|editor=Enrico Pattaro|publisher=Springer|date=2011|series=A Treatise of Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence|volume=11|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result Hart's book has remained "one of the most influential text of analytical legal philosophy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-endless-search-for-truth/|title=The Endless Search For Truth: Richard Marshall interviews Andrei Marmor|last=Marshall|first=Richard|date=2012-07-06|publisher=[[3:AM Magazine]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "the most successful work of analytical jurisprudence ever to appear in the common law world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=A. W. Brian|title=Reflections on 'The Concept of Law'|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2011|pages=1|isbn=0199693323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Concept of Law'' emerged from a set of lectures Hart delivered in 1952. The lectures were preceded by Hart's Holmes lecture, ''Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals'' at [[Harvard Law School]]. The book developed a sophisticated view of legal positivism.

Among the ideas developed in the book are:
*A critique of [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin's]] theory that law is the command of the sovereign backed by sanction.
*A distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, where a primary rule governs conduct and a secondary rule allows the creation, alteration, or extinction of primary rules.
*A distinction between the internal and external points of view of law and rules, close to (and influenced by) [[Max Weber]]'s distinction between the sociological and the legal perspectives of law.
*The idea of the [[rule of recognition]], a social rule that differentiated between those norms that have the authority of law and those that do not. Hart viewed the rule of recognition as an evolution from [[Hans Kelsen]]'s "''[[Grundnorm]]''", or "basic norm".
*A reply to [[Ronald Dworkin]], who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in ''Taking Rights Seriously'' (1977), ''A Matter of Principle'' (1985) and ''Law's Empire'' (1986).

==Austin's "command theory"==
The starting point for the discussion is Hart's dissatisfaction with [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s "command theory": a jurisprudential concept that holds that law is command backed by threat and is meant to be ubiquitous in its application.  Hart likens Austin's theory to the role of a [[gun|gunman]] in a [[bank]] and tries to establish the differences between the gunman's orders and those made by law. (For instance, the gunman forces us to obey but we may not feel inclined to obey him. Presumably, obedience to the law comes with a different feeling.) 

Hart identifies three such important differences: content, origin, and range. In terms of content, not all laws are imperative or [[coercive]]. Some are facilitative, allowing us to create [[contracts]] and other legal relations.

Austin believed that every legal system had to have a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] who creates the law (origin) while remaining unaffected by it (range), such as the bank scene's gunman, who is the only source of commands and who is not subject to other's commands.  Hart argues that this is an inaccurate description of law, noting that laws may have several sources and legislators are very often subject to the laws they create. Hart lets us know that laws are much broader in scope than coercive orders, contrary to the "command theory" of Austin. Frequently laws are enabling and so allow citizens to carry out authoritative acts such as the making of wills or contracts which have legal effect.

==Social habits and rules==
Hart draws a distinction between a social [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] (which people follow habitually but where breaking the habit does not bring about opprobrium - going to the cinema on Thursday for example) and a social rule (where breaking the rule is seen as wrong - neglecting to take off one's hat upon entering a church, for example).  We feel in some sense bound by social rules and laws frequently appear to be types of social rule. 

There are two perspectives to this: the external aspect, which is the independently observable fact that people do tend to obey the rule with regularity, and the internal aspect which is the feeling by an individual of being in some sense obligated to follow the rule, otherwise known as the critical reflective attitude. It is from this internal sense that the law acquires its normative quality. The obedience by the populace of a rule is called efficacy. No law can be said to be efficacious unless followed by the majority of the populace. Though an average citizen in a modern state with a developed legal system may feel the internal aspect and be compelled to follow the laws, it is more important for the officials of the society/peoples to have  the internal aspect since it is up to them to follow the constitutional provisions which, if they wish, could ignore without accountability. Yet, the officials must use the internal aspect and accept the standards as guiding their behaviour in addition to also guiding the behaviour of other officials.

==Hart's Empirical Legal System in "The Concept of Law"==
Hart believed law is the union of '''primary rules''' (rules of conduct) and '''secondary rules''' (empowering rules). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=H.L.A.|title=The Concept of Law|date=1994|page=94|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary Rules===
''Primary rules'' are rules, or laws, that govern general societal conduct. Thus, ''primary rules'' construct legal obligations and consequences when they are disobeyed. A good example of a ''primary rule'' is the law against murder; it prohibits a person from killing and attaches consequences for committing, attempting to commit, and conspiring to commit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary Rules===
''Secondary rules'' confer power to create sovereignty; they also confer the power to change, modify, or enforce primary (and secondary) rules.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary rules combat the three major issues of legal systems that ''primary rules'' can't–(1) &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the law, (2) &lt;u&gt;efficiency&lt;/u&gt; of the law, and (3) &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; ''quality'' of the law. Each kind of ''secondary rule'' addresses a separate one of those three issues, yet all are interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-97&lt;/ref&gt; Hart separates secondary rules into three types–the '''rules of recognition''', the '''rules of change''', and the '''rules of adjudication'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.93-120&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rules of Recognition====
Hart states that the remedy for the &lt;u&gt;uncertainty&lt;/u&gt; of the regime of primary rules is a ''rule of recognition''. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of recognition is a collection of standards and requisites that govern the validity of all rules; thus, the rule of recognition confers power to new rules by validating them. For a rule to be valid is to recognize it as passing all the tests provided by the rule of recognition. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Change====
There are no legal systems that can be classified as [[pareto optimal]]. The next best thing is to make sure that the system does not remain at a static quality but instead is dynamic and progressive. The remedy for the &lt;u&gt;static&lt;/u&gt; quality of the regime of ''primary rules'' are ''rules of change''.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, rules of change confer and prohibit power of the creation, extinction and alteration of primary and secondary rules. Rules of change range in complexity: “the powers conferred may be unrestricted or limited in various ways: and the rules may, besides specifying the persons who are to legislate, define in more or less rigid terms the procedure to be followed in legislation.” As mentioned earlier, rules of change are interdependent with the other rules. Hart emphasizes the “close connection between the rules of change and the rules of recognition.” Where rules of change exist, rules of recognition "ʺwill necessarily incorporate a reference to legislation as an identifying feature of the rules, though it need not refer to all the details of procedure involved in legislation.” &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Rules of Adjudication====
''Rules of adjudication'' were intended to remedy the &lt;u&gt;inefficiency&lt;/u&gt; of its diffused social pressure. Rules of adjudication empower individuals to make authoritative determinations of the question whether, on a particular occasion, a primary rule has been broken.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (“Besides identifying the individuals who are to adjudicate, such rules will also define the procedure to be followed”)&lt;/ref&gt; Rules of adjudication govern the election and procedure of the judiciary. However, intermingled with who adjudicates is what laws they adjudicate. &lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that “if courts are empowered to make authoritative determinations of the fact that a rule has been broken, these cannot avoid being taken as authoritative determinations of what the rules are.”)&lt;/ref&gt; Under that logic, rules of adjudication, like rules of change, must also be supplemented by rules of recognition of some sort. Thus, “the rule which confers jurisdiction will also be a rule of recognition, identifying the primary rules through the judgments of the courts and these judgments will become a 'source' of law.”&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1994, p.96-97 (Hart emphasizes that a “system which has rules of adjudication is necessarily also committed to a rule of recognition of an elementary and imperfect sort.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The dose makes the poison'''" ({{lang-la|'''sola dosis facit venenum'''}}) is an [[adage]] intended to indicate a basic principle of [[toxicology]]. It is credited to [[Paracelsus]] who expressed the classic toxicology maxim "All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison." This is often condensed to: "The dose makes the poison" or in Latin, {{lang|la|"Sola dosis facit venenum"}}. It means that a substance can produce the harmful effect associated with its toxic properties only if it reaches a susceptible biological system within the body in a high enough concentration (i.e., [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html The Dose Makes the Poison on Chemsafe at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202055026/http://learn.caim.yale.edu/chemsafe/references/dose.html |date=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle relies on the finding that all chemicals—even [[Water intoxication|water]] and [[Oxygen toxicity|oxygen]]—can be toxic if too much is eaten, drunk, or absorbed. "The toxicity of any particular chemical depends on many factors, including the extent to which it enters an individual’s body."&lt;ref name="Trautmann"&gt;[http://www.actionbioscience.org/environment/trautmann.html Nancy Trautmann: The Dose Makes the Poison--Or Does It?], Bioscience 2005, American Institute of Biological Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; This finding also provides the basis for public health standards, which specify maximum acceptable concentrations of various contaminants in food, public drinking water, and the environment.&lt;ref name="Trautmann"/&gt;

However, there is no linear relationship and also more to chemical toxicity than the acute effects caused by short-term exposure. Relatively low doses of contaminants in water, food, and environment can already have significant chronic effects if there is a long-term exposure.&lt;ref name="Trautmann"/&gt;  Many pollutants, drugs, and natural substances adhere to this principle by causing different effects at different levels, which can as a result lead to health standards that are either too strong or too weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite |url=http://www.ourstolenfuture.org/NewScience/lowdose/2007/2007-0525nmdrc.html |last=Pete Myers, Ph.D. and Wendy Hessle |title= Does 'the dose make the poison?' |website=ourstolenfuture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the effects of different doses can be very different at different levels (not only bigger and smaller impacts depending on dose).

The '''UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning''' (formerly: UNESCO Institute for Education) is one of six educational institutes of [[UNESCO]]. It is a non-profit international research, training, information, documentation and publishing centre on [[literacy]], [[non-formal education]], adult and [[lifelong learning]]. By linking educational research, policy and practice in these areas, UIL makes a special contribution in enhancing access to learning, and improving the environment and quality of learning for all in all regions of the world. 
UIL provides services in literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning to UNESCO's Member States, [[NGO]]s, and grassroots and community organizations, but also to partners in civil society and the private sector. In doing so, the Institute works in close collaboration with its Paris headquarters, with UNESCO field offices in different countries, with sister institutes and with national and international partners.

UIL is based in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The [[Senate of Hamburg|Senate (government) of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg]] provides the Institute with premises close to the University, in a historic villa, which was built for the shipping magnate [[Albert Ballin]]. In February 2007, a country agreement was signed which defines the terms and conditions under which the UIL is hosted by the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].

== Mission ==

UIL's mission is to see to it that all forms of education and learning – formal, non-formal and informal – are recognized, valued and available for meeting the demands of individuals and communities throughout the world. UIL responds to these demands and helps meet the challenges facing humanity (peace and democracy, [[sustainable development]] and poverty eradication, nurturing diversity, defeating HIV/AIDS, protecting the environment) with policy-driven research, [[capacity-building]], networking, publications and technical services for Member States and non-governmental and civil society organisations, as well as private providers at their request.

==Projects==

* Publication of the [[International Review of Education]], the longest-running international journal on comparative education
* Coordination of the 6th International Conference on Adult Education ([[CONFINTEA]] VI)
* ALADIN network
* Coordination of the Adult Learners Week
* Cooperation with the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA)

== Research ==

UIL’s research covers appropriate concepts, good practice, favourable conditions and innovative approaches in the areas of literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning in different cultural contexts, including all modes of learning (formal, non-formal and informal), with a view to the creation of lifelong learning environments, the making of literate societies and the building of learning societies. All research activities aim at promoting adult and lifelong learning and at highlighting the contribution of learning to poverty alleviation, sustainable human development, democracy and critical citizenship.

Research work is mainly policy-driven and action-oriented. The research carried out by the Institute may take the form of individual case and country studies, comparative analyses, regional and cross-regional syntheses, international surveys, conceptual and position papers, co-operative and joint investigations with academics, partner institutions, governmental organizations, [[NGO]]s and CSOs, etc.

Specific research questions and themes relate to the following:
*Theories and practices of literacy
*Foundations of lifelong learning
*The making of literate societies
*The creation of supportive policy and legislative environments/conditions for lifelong learning;
*The creation of literate environments, especially in multicultural and multilingual settings;
*Integration of formal, non-formal and informal education: recognition, accreditation and validation of non-formal, informal and experiential learning; qualification frameworks, equivalencies and bridges;
*Adult learning for sustainable development with a focus on HIV/AIDS, environmental protection, democratic participation, conflict prevention, critical citizenship and good governance;
*Gender mainstreaming in literacy, non-formal education, adult and lifelong learning with a focus on budgeting, monitoring and evaluation;
*Development of gender-just and culturally sensitive indicators;
*Impact of literacy, non-formal education and adult learning;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10299">'''Ultimogeniture''', also known as '''postremogeniture''' or '''junior right''', is the tradition of [[inheritance]] by the last-born of a privileged position in a parent's wealth or office.  The tradition has been far rarer historically than [[primogeniture]] (sole inheritance by the first-born) or [[partible inheritance]] (division of the estate among the children).

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Ultimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of "keeping the hearth", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults.

There are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture.  One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded.

[[Coercion]], [[assassination]], [[fratricide]], or even [[patricide]] can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped.
To clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist.

==Usage examples==
* Many [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions around the world include important figures who were youngest siblings, although they are subject to various interpretations. Several important [[Biblical]] characters—including [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[David]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=729&amp;letter=J |title=Jewish Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are described as youngest sons or daughters, leading some scholars to propose a prehistoric practice of ultimogeniture among the [[Hebrews]], although this form of inheritance is not espoused by the preserved text.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deut|21|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some early [[Greek myth]]s, [[Greek kingship|kingship]] was conferred by marriage to a tribal [[nymph]], who was selected by ultimogeniture or success in a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uk.geocities.com/lucath/myths.html |title="Myths" (Geocities) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115650/http://uk.geocities.com/lucath/myths.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[England]], patrilineal ultimogeniture (i.e., inheritance by the youngest surviving male child) is known as '''Borough English''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Alternatively rendered as '''borough English''' and '''Borough-English'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}}} after its former practice in various ancient [[England|English]] [[borough]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} It was only enforced against those who died [[intestate]] and frequently—though not universally—also included the principle of inheritance by the deceased's youngest brother when there was no son.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Less often, the practice was extended to the youngest daughter, sister, aunt, etc.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Its origin is much disputed, although the [[Anglo-Normans|Normans]]—who generally practiced [[primogeniture]]—considered it to be a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] legacy.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} A 1327 court case found it to be the practice of the English burgh at [[Nottingham]], although not of that town's "French" district.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of 22 Edward IV. fol. 32b.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition was also found across many rural areas of England where lands were held in tenure by [[Soke (legal)|socage]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} It also occurred in [[copyhold]] [[manor]]s in [[Hampshire]], [[Surrey]], [[Middlesex]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} [[Suffolk]], and [[Sussex]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} where manorial custom dictated the form of inheritance to be ultimogeniture.
* In the German Duchy of [[Saxe-Altenburg]], land-holdings traditionally passed to the youngest son, who might then employ his older brothers as farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, ''9th ed.'' |contribution=Saxe-Altenburg }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[India]], matrilineal ultimogeniture is practiced by the [[Khasi people]] of [[Meghalaya]], wherein inheritance is traditionally passed down to the youngest daughter. Although portions of the property are divided among siblings, the bulk of the share, including the "ancestral hearth", is bestowed on the youngest daughter ({{lang|kha| ka khadduh}}), who is also expected to take care of the aging parents, as well as any unmarried siblings. As a consequence, marriage to the youngest daughter is [[uxorilocal]], as opposed to marriage to the other siblings, which is [[neolocal]].
* Among the Malabar [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] community of [[Kerala]] in southern India, a variant of ultimogeniture is practised, where the youngest son gets the ancestral house (''[[tharavad]]'') and adjoining property and is expected to take care of his elderly parents, while his elder brothers also get a share of the property though they live separately; the daughters are granted a bounteous dowry but traditionally do not receive inheritance of property.&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ycZjQeZ278C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;q=Ultimogeniture|title=“Stridhanam: Rethinking Dowry, Inheritance and Women's Resistance Among the Syrian Christians of Kerala.” Anthropologica|last=Philips|first=Amali|date=2003|publisher=Canadian Anthropology Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"/&gt; Only if there are no sons, the husband of the youngest daughter is formally embraced into the family as adopted son (''dathu puthran'') to fulfill the role of the youngest son. &lt;ref name="book_syrian_christian_2014"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt6vAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT480&amp;q=youngest+son|title=Eastern Christianity and Politics in the Twenty-First Century|last=Leustean|first=Lucian N.|date=2014-05-30|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317818656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper_dowry_syrian_christian_2003"/&gt;
* In some southwestern areas of [[Japan]], property was traditionally apportioned by a modified version of ultimogeniture known as ''masshi souzoku'' ({{lang|ja|末子相続}}).  An estate was distributed equally among all sons or children, except that the youngest received a double share as a reward for caring for the elderly parents in their last years. Official surveys conducted during the early years of the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era demonstrated that the most common family form throughout the country during the [[Edo period]] was characterized by stem structure, patrilineal descent, patrivirilocal{{clarify|date=August 2017}} residence and patrilineal [[primogeniture]], but in some southwestern areas this combination of partible inheritance and ultimogeniture was sometimes employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Family History Revisited: Comparative Perspectives |editor-last=Wall |editor-first=Richard Wall |editor2-first=Tamara K. |editor2-last=Hareven |editor3-first=Joseph |editor3-last=Ehmer |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8awruI9XyXsC&amp;pg=PA343 343–344]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Among [[Mongols]], each son received part of the family herd as he married, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but the ancestral seat was inherited by the youngest along with his share of the herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Influence of the Great Code "Yasa" on the Mongolian Empire |url=http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, each son inherited part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder sons receiving more than the younger ones, but further afield from the family tent. (Family units would often remain near enough for close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations.){{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Similarly, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongolian Empire|empire]] was divided among all four of his sons, but the [[Mongolia|Mongolian homeland]] was passed to his youngest, [[Tolui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200301/the.arts.of.the.mongols.htm |title="The Arts of the Mongols"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kachin people|Kachin]] of northern [[Burma]] and southern [[China]] traditionally instruct elder sons to move away upon maturity, leaving the youngest son to inherit the family property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://victoria.linguistlist.org/~lapolla/rda/EO.htm |title=(Linguist List) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villem Raam was born in [[Pärnu]] and studied art history at [[Tartu University]]. In 1938 he produced his first scholarly work on medieval Estonian architecture. Following the occupation of Estonia, in July 1940 Raam became the director of the State Art Museum of Soviet Estonia; however, in June 1941 he was arrested by Soviet authorities and deported to Siberia. He would remain in [[Gulag|labour camp]] for fifteen years. He was allowed to return to Estonia in 1956 and was able to continue working in his academic field, first as an employee at an institution with the purpose of registering architectural monuments. In 1957 he was admitted and eventually made a member of the board of the Estonian SSR Artists' Union. Subsequently he dedicated the rest of his life to art history, conservation issues and art criticism. Among his tangible contributions are the restoration of [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St. Nicholas' church]] in [[Tallinn]], which he managed to convince the authorities to transform into a museum of ecclesiastical art rather than an initially planned "museum of atheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Randla|first1= Anneli|last2= |first2= |year= 2010|title= Villem Raam 100|journal= Baltic Journal of Art History|volume= |issue= 2010.

In 1996, Raam was awarded the [[Order of the National Coat of Arms]], 3rd class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/decorations/bearers.php?tm=Riigivapi+III+klassi+teenetem%C3%A4rk&amp;pn=raam&amp;en=|title= Estonian State Decorations|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= President of the Republic of Estonia|publisher= |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between June 2010 and May 2011, an exhibition his architectural photographs was made at the [[Art Museum of Estonia]] to mark the centenary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nigulistemuuseum.ee/et/naitused/toimunud/8-est/sisulehed/369-raami-pildid-villem-raam-fotograafina|title= Raami pildid.

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:
* [[WARC Software Development Kit]] (WSDK) represents a set of simple, compact, and highly optimized Erlang modules to manipulate (create/read/write) the [[Web ARChive|WARC]] ISO 28500:2009 file format.
