      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">The '''A.D. Xenopol Institute of History''' ({{lang-ro|Institutul de Istorie „A.D. Xenopol”}}) in [[Iași]] is an institution of research in the field of [[history]] under the auspices of the [[Romanian Academy]]. The institute was named in honour of Romanian historian [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]].

The institute was founded in 1941 as the "A.D. Xenopol Institute for the History of Romanians" within the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University]], by Professor [[Ilie Minea]], and became an independent entity in 1943 (as the "A.D. Xenopol Institute of National History").&lt;ref&gt;[http://adxenopol.academiaromana-is.ro/istoric.html Istoricul Institutului]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 it was renamed the "A.D. Xenopol Institute of History and Archaeology", and placed under the authority of the [[Academy of Social and Political Sciences of the Socialist Republic of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adxenopol.academiaromana-is.ro/istoric.html Istoricul Institutului]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Romanian Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] and the disbandment of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences, the Institute is passed under the aegis of the [[Romanian Academy]]. The archaeology section splits off, forming the [[Iași Institute of Archaeology]], and the institute acquires its present name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adxenopol.academiaromana-is.ro/istoric.html Istoricul Institutului]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre''' or '''AMMRC''' was established in 1996 as a co-operative centre of the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales]].

The centre’s research program includes the impacts of climate change, the spatial, haul-out and foraging behaviour of [[leopard seal]]s, population monitoring of [[Antarctic]] [[marine mammals]], and the development of non-invasive techniques that will allow researchers to monitor the hormones of wild populations (whales, dolphins and seals) without having to restrain the animals.

The researchers, behavioural ecologists and veterinarians, work on projects including:
* [[Pinniped|Seals]] of the Antarctic pack ice,
* [[Cetaceans]] in the coastal waters of [[New Guinea]],
* Seal and cetacean populations in Australian waters,
* Comparing southern and northern hemisphere endangered populations of cetaceans.

The research is supported by such organisations as the (Australian) [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO).

'''''Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines''''' is a 2000 book by Robert McIntosh, published by [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]. The book is about [[child labour]] in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with special reference to the history of boys, aged 8 to 15, who worked in [[coal mines]]. These boys worked underground, leading horses along subterranean roads, manipulating ventilation doors, helping miners cut and lift tons of coal, and filling wagons with freshly mined coal.&lt;ref name=boys&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/03/bookrevs.htm Book reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/0424 Boys in the Pits: Child Labour in Coal Mines]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[business]] training, education or analysis. It can be [[scenario]]-based or [[Number|numeric]]-based.

Most business simulations are used for business acumen training and development. Learning objectives include: strategic thinking, decision making, problem solving, financial analysis, market analysis, operations, teamwork and leadership.&lt;ref name="bizsims"&gt;[http://www.bizsims.edu.au/ Online Business Simulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The business gaming community seems lately to have adopted the term '''business simulation game''' instead of just '''gaming''' or just '''simulation'''. The word '''simulation''' is sometimes considered too mechanistic for educational purposes. '''Simulation''' also refers to activities where an optimum for some problem is searched for, while this is not usually the aim of an educational game. On the other hand, the word '''game''' can imply time wasting, not taking things too seriously and engaging in an exercise designed purely for fun. The concept of '''simulation gaming''' seems to offer the right combination and balance between the two.&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"&gt;Lainema (2003). Enhancing Organizational Business Process Perception – Experiences from Constructing and Applying a Dynamic Business Simulation Game. Turku School of Economics, Series A-5:2003. {{ISBN|951-564-139-X}}. Online: http://info.tse.fi/julkaisut/vk/Ae5_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation gaming is also the term that the educational gaming community has adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Greenblat, Cathy Stein (1988). Designing Games and Simulations: An Illustrated Handbook. Sage Publications, Newbury Park&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games and business simulation games ==
Partly, the terminology of [[business simulation game]]s is not well established. The most common term used is '''[[business game]]''' but several other terms are also in use. Here we will define the most common terms used in context of (computer-based) business learning environments.

Klabbers (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (1999). Three Easy Pieces: A Taxonomy of Gaming. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 16-33&lt;/ref&gt; notes that gaming is sometimes associated with something that is frivolous, just for the fun of it. This hampers its scientific endeavor and the more serious connotations of gaming in the scientific arena. The term game is used to describe activities in which some or all of these characteristics are prominent:&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"&gt;Elgood, Chris (1996). Using Management Games. 2nd edition, Gower Press, Aldershot, Hampshire, England&lt;/ref&gt;
* human, humanly controlled, opponents, whose actions have an effect upon each other and upon the environment,
* an emphasis on competitiveness and winning,
* an emphasis on pleasure, humour and enjoyment,
* a repetitive cycle of making decisions and encountering a result, allowing the hope of improvement and 'doing better next time'.

Games are played when one or more players compete or cooperate for payoffs, according to an agreed set of rules. Players behave as themselves though they may well display exceptional behavior.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"&gt;Jaques, David (1995). Games, Simulations and Case Studies – A Review. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 21-38&lt;/ref&gt; Games are social systems and they include actors (players), rules and resources, which are the basic building blocks of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2001). Bridging information &amp; knowledge society: potentials of gaming. In Rahnu, L. (ed.) Bridging the Information and Knowledge Societies. Tartu University Press, Tartu, Estonia&lt;/ref&gt; In each game, the players (actors) interact with one another, while applying different rules, and utilizing different resources.&lt;ref&gt;Klabbers, Jan H. G. (2003). Interactive Learning of What? In Percival, Godfrey, Laybourn and Murray (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Vol. 11, pp. 257-266. Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya&lt;ref&gt;Tsuchiya, Tomoaki and Tsuchiya, Shigehisa (1999). The Unique Contribution of Gaming/Simulation: Towards Establishment of the Discipline. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 46-57&lt;/ref&gt; note that the simulation gaming community is still struggling to establish itself as a discipline, although 35 years have passed since the International Simulation and Gaming Association ('''ISAGA''') was established. To be a discipline, simulation gaming needs a theory, methodology, and application and validation. Of these, forming a theory is the most difficult challenge. Similar comments come from Wolfe and Crookall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Joseph and Crookall, David (1998). Developing a Scientific Knowledge of Simulation/Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 7-19&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to prior research they conclude that the educational simulation gaming field has been unable to create a generally accepted typology, let alone taxonomy, of the nature of simulation gaming. According to them this is unfortunate because the basis of any science is its ability to discriminate and classify phenomena within its purview, based on underlying theory and precepts. Without this, the field has been stuck, despite its age, at a relatively low level of development.

In most cases, the terms '''business (simulation) game''' and '''management (simulation) game''' can be used interchangeably and there is no well-established difference between these two terms. Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"&gt;Greenlaw, Paul S., Herron, Lowell W. and Rawdon, Richard H. (1962). Business Simulation in Industrial and University Education. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; determine a business game (or business simulation) as ''a sequential decision-making exercise structure around a model of a business operation, in which participants assume the role of managing the simulated operation''. The descriptions given for a management game, for example, by Forrester&lt;ref&gt;Forrester, Jay W. (1961). Industrial Dynamics. The M.I.T. Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, London&lt;/ref&gt; and Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"&gt;Naylor, Thomas H. (1971). Computer Simulation Experiments with Models of Economic Systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, New York&lt;/ref&gt; do not differ from the previous. However, Elgood&lt;ref name="Elgood, Chris 1996"/&gt; determines that in a management game profit is not the dominant measure of success. Keys and Wolfe&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keys | first1 = Bernard | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = Joseph | year = 1990 | title = The Role of Management Games and Simulations in Education and Research | url = | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 307–336 | doi=10.1177/014920639001600205}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a management game as a simplified simulated experiential environment that contains enough verisimilitude, or illusion of reality, to include real world-like responses by those participating in the exercise.

Gredler&lt;ref&gt;Gredler, Margaret E. (1996). Educational Games and Simulations: A Technology in Search of a (Research) Paradigm. In Jonassen, David H. (ed.) Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology. Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; divides experiential simulations into the following four categories:
# Data management simulations,
# Diagnostic simulations,
# Crisis management simulations, and
# Social-process simulations.
Business simulation games are most often of the first kind. A participant in a data management simulation typically functions as a member of a team of managers or planners. Each team is managing a company allocating economic resources to any of several variables in order to achieve a particular goal.

Business strategy games are intended to enhance students' decision-making skills, especially under conditions defined by limited time and information.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn and Sigelman, Lee (1991). Computer Simulation Applications, An Introduction. Sage Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; They vary in focus from how to undertake a corporate takeover to how to expand a company's share of the market. Typically, the player feeds information into a computer program and receives back a series of optional or additional data that are conditional upon the player's initial choices. The game proceeds through several series of these interactive, iterative steps. As can be noted, this definition does not consider continuous (real-time) processing an alternative.

In business simulation games players receive a description of an imaginary business and an imaginary environment and make decisions – on price, advertising, production targets, etc. – about how their company should be run. A business game may have an industrial, commercial or financial background (Elgood, 1996). Ju and Wagner&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"&gt;Ju, Edward and Wagner, Christian (1997). Personal Computer Games: Their Structure, Principles, and Applicability for Training. The DATA BASE for Advances in Information Systems, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 78-92&lt;/ref&gt; mention that the nature of business games can include decision-making tasks, which pit the player against a hostile environment or hostile opponents. These simulations have a nature of strategy or war games, but usually are very terse in their user interface. Other types of managerial simulations are resource allocation games, in which the player or players have to allocate resources to areas such as plant, production, operations, marketing, and human resources, in order to produce and sell goods.

According to Senge and Lannon&lt;ref&gt;Senge, P. M. and Lannon, C. (1997). Managerial Microworlds. Technology Review, Vol. 93, Issue 5, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt; in '''managerial microworlds''' – like business simulation games – unlike in the actual world, managers are free to experiment with policies and strategies without fear of jeopardizing the company. This process includes the kind of reflection and inquiry for which there is no time in the hectic everyday world. Thus, Senge and Lannon argue, managers learn about the long-term, systemic consequences of their actions. Such "virtual worlds" are particularly important in team learning. Managers can learn to think systemically if they can uncover the subtle interactions that thwart their efforts.

Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; in 1971 gives quite a detailed view of the contents, structure, and operating of management games. Today, this description by Naylor is still valid for most of the business simulation games. Business simulation games are built around a hypothetical oligopolistic industry consisting of three to six firms, whose decision-makers or managers are the participants of the game. Each firm or team is allocated a specific amount of resources in the form of cash, inventories, raw materials, plant and equipment, and so forth. Before each operating period the players make decisions. Naylor mentions that these decisions can concern, e.g., price, output, advertising, marketing, raw material acquisition, changes in plant capacity, and wage rate. This information is read into a computer that has been programmed on the basis of a set of mathematical models that provide a link between the operating results and operating decisions of the individual firms, as well as the external environment (the market). On the basis of '''(a)''' a set of behavioral equations, such as demand and cost functions, and a set of accounting formulas that have been programmed into the computer, and '''(b)''' the individual decisions of each firm, operating results are generated by the computer in the form of printed reports – for example, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, production reports, sales reports, and total industry reports – at the end of each operating period. Usually the environment can be changed by the administrator of the game by altering the parameters of the operating characteristics of the game. In each case, the firms find it necessary to react according to the magnitude and the nature of the change imposed by the external environment. Naylor mentions that some of the more complicated and more realistic games even permit multiple products, plants, and marketing areas, stochastic production periods, stochastic demand, labor negotiations, and the sale of common stock. For more information about this topic see Lainema (2003).&lt;ref name="info.tse.fi"/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of games for education and development was the war game simulations in China in about 3,000 B.C. These games bore a vague similarity to the early 17th century chess.&lt;ref name="Keys 1990 pp. 307-336"/&gt; In the Western world, war games date back to at least the German Kriegspiel of the mid-nineteenth century (Faria and Dickinson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faria | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Dickinson | first2 = John R. | year = 1994 | title = Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training | url = | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 47–59 | doi=10.1108/02621719410050183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faria and Dickinson note that different war games have also been conducted in Japan before the Second World War and war games have been long used by the British and the Americans to test battle strategies. Military officers trained with war games in the 1930s and 1940s started to use their military training to manage civilian businesses. Some of the business game evolution can be traced to a 1955 Rand Corporation game, which simulated the U.S. Air Force inventory management within its supply system.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. R. (1959). Learning from Experience in Business Decision Games. California Management Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 92-107&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlaw et al.&lt;ref name="Greenlaw, Paul S. 1962"/&gt; state that business simulation exercises may be considered an outgrowth of earlier developments in three fields: military war gaming, operations research, and educational role-playing.

According to Naylor,&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; the use of games in business and economics goes back to 1956 when the American Management Association developed the first so-called management decision-making game, called the Top Management Decision Game. Faria and Dickinson and Greenlaw et al. also find this the first widely known business decision-making simulation, although Greenlaw et al. date the origin of the game to 1957 and further specify that it was the first non-military competitive business game. Greenlaw et al. note that the Top Management Decision Simulation stimulated the design and use of dozens of other games. In this simulation five teams of players operated firms competing in a hypothetical, one-product industry. Teams made quarterly decisions covering price, production volume, budgets, research and development, advertising, and sales force and could request selected marketing research information. During the period 1955-1957 only one or two new games appeared each year (Faria, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Faria, Anthony J. (1990). Business Simulation Games after Thirty Years: Current Usage Levels in the United States. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 36-47&lt;/ref&gt;

A rapid growth in the number of business games occurred over the years from 1958 to 1961. Greenlaw et al. had made a summary of some business games available by the beginning of the 1960s. The summary includes 89 different business games or different versions of a certain business game developed by industrial firms, business associations, educational institutes, or governmental units. Naylor&lt;ref name="Naylor, Thomas H. 1971"/&gt; mentions already in 1971 that hundreds of management games have been developed by various universities, business firms, and research organizations. These management games have been used both for research purposes and for training people in diverse disciplines such as management, business operation, economics, organization theory, psychology, production management, finance, accounting, and marketing. Also Faria (1990) and Dickinson note that the number of simulation games grew rapidly in the 1960s. McRaith and Goeldner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRaith | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Goeldner | first2 = C. R. | year = 1962 | title = A Survey of Marketing Games | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 26 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; list 29 marketing games, of which 20 had been developed by business firms and nine by academians for university teaching. In 1969 Graham and Gray&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. G., and Gray, C. F. (1969). Business Games Handbook. American Management Association, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; listed nearly 200 business games of different varieties. Horn and Cleaves&lt;ref&gt;Horn, R. E., and Cleaves, A. (1980). The Guide to Simulation/Games for Education and Training. Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  provided a description of 228 business games. Faria (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Faria, A.J. (1989). Business Gaming: Current Usage Levels. Management Development Review, Vol. 8, No. 2, pp. 58-66&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that over 200 simulations were in use in the United States in over 1,700 business schools. Overall, taking advantage of computer games in education increased enormously through the 1960s to the 1980s, see for example Ju and Wagner.&lt;ref name="Wagner, Christian 1997 pp. 78-92"/&gt;

At the end of the 1980s Faria (1990) estimated that there were approximately 228 games available in the United States, and that there were around 8,500 instructors using business games. At that point Faria also believes that there is a large and growing number of business schools instructors and business firm users of simulation games. Still, Faria estimated that only 12.5% of all US business firms with training and development managers used computerized business games.

The penetration of business gaming in academia is fuelled by the following factors:&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Thomas F. (1995). Strategy Support during a Business Game using an Expert System. In Saunders, Danny and Severn, Jackie (eds.) The International Simulation &amp; Gaming Research Yearbook: Simulations and Games for Strategy and Policy Planning. Kogan Page, London, pp. 87-101&lt;/ref&gt; the increase in student numbers, the increase in new courses, increased adoption of methods supporting diverse learning styles, and the increasing availability of technology. Dickinson and Faria&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, John R. and Faria, A. J. (1995). Simulation Gaming for Sales Management Training and a Demonstration. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 99-109&lt;/ref&gt; state that in US over 200 business games are being used by nearly 9,000 teachers at over 1,700 colleges offering business programmes.

Larsen and Lomi&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Erik and Lomi, Alessandro (1999). System Dynamics and the 'New Technology' for Organizational Decisions: From Mapping and Simulation to Learning and Understanding. European Management Journal, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 117-119&lt;/ref&gt; describe the shift of the objectives of management gaming. They state that until the early 1980s simulation was used to forecast the behavior of a variety of sub-system level variables, ranging from the cash flow and financial performance of a company, to the inflation and unemployment rates of an economy. They state further, that during the last 15 years a new way of thinking about simulation emerged. Instead of focusing on predicting, simulation progressively became a tool to help management teams understand their company and industry's problems and opportunities. Simulations could prepare for the future and reduce the sensitivity of possible strategies to changes in alternative frames of reference – or mental models. Larsen and Lomi further note, that the emphasis of computer-based simulation models has shifted:
# from predicting the future, to understanding how multiple possible futures might be linked to decisions and actions that must be taken today, and
# from designing the best strategy, to analyzing how robust our preferred strategy would be under different assumptions about how the future might unfold, or about how the past actually produced the events that we perceive.

In the late 1990s, training and consulting companies began designing and customizing business simulations for individual companies to augment their corporate leadership development programs. The business simulations often focused on strategy and business acumen. The business simulations allowed participants to test their decision-making skills, make mistakes, and safely learn from their experience. Some refer to this type of employee education as "[[experiential learning]]".  By 2000, business simulations were available that blended the traditional business acumen (financial) skills  with the softer – interpersonal – skills required for effective leadership development.

==Scenario simulations ==
In a [[business game]] or business simulation game, a scenario is played out in a simulated environment and the learner or user is asked to make individual or team based decisions on how to act in the simulations. Often multiple choice alternatives are used and the scenario is played out following a branching tree based on which decisions the learner makes. Throughout or at certain intervals feedback is provided. These are similar to [[role-play]] simulations.

==Numeric simulations ==
A numeric simulation can mimic a whole company on a high level or it can be more detailed and mimic specific organizational units or processes. In a numeric simulation the learner or user makes decisions by pulling levers and dialers as well as through inputting numbers. The decisions are processed and the outcomes are calculated and shown in reports and graphs, e.g. price and volume as well as number of employees can be decisions and the outcome can be viewed in e.g. an [[income statement]], a [[balance sheet]] and a [[cash flow statement]]. [[Feedback]] is given throughout the simulation or at certain intervals, such as when a year has passed. Many numeric business simulations include elements of competition against other participants or against computer generated competitors.

== Types of business simulation games ==
Business simulation games can be classified according to several properties. The first taxonomies were introduced already in the beginning of the 1960s (see e.g. Greenlaw et al., 1962). Here we introduce the taxonomy from Biggs,&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, William D. (1990). Introduction to Computerized Business Management Simulations. In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 23-35&lt;/ref&gt; which is practically identical with the taxonomy from Greenlaw et al.

== The simulation gaming process ==
Business simulation game developers regard their artifacts to be learning environments. When arguing for this, they most often refer to [[David A. Kolb|David A. Kolb's]] influential work in the field of [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolb, David (1984). Experiential Learning: Experience the Source of Learning and Development. Prentice-Hall, Inc, Englewood Cliffs&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decades ideas from [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] and authentic e-learning have also provided new perspectives for considering the role of business simulations in learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lainema, T. (2009). Perspective Making – Constructivism as a Meaning Structure for Simulation Gaming. Simulation &amp; Gaming: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Theory, Practice and Research, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 48-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="authenticlearning"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://authenticlearning.info/# |title=Authentic e-Learning |access-date=2015-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313190110/http://authenticlearning.info/# |archive-date=2015-03-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The activities carried out during a simulation game training session are:&lt;ref&gt;Villegas, Jaime (1997). Simulation Supported Industrial Training: A Method for Increasing the Competence of People in Companies. Saunders, Peter and Cox, Benita (eds.) The International Simulation and Gaming Yearbook, Volume 5: Research into Simulations in Education. Kogan Page, London, pp. 144-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical instruction: the teacher goes through certain relevant aspects of a theory and participants can intervene with questions and comments.
* Introduction to the game: the participants are told how to operate the computer and how to play the game.
* Playing the game: participants get the opportunity to practice their knowledge and skills by changing different parameters of the game and reflecting on the possible consequences of these changes. Permanent contact with the participants is advisable, as well as keeping the training going to maintain a positive atmosphere and to secure that the participants feel engaged.
* Group discussions: Each of the participants is given a possibility to present and compare their results from the game with the results of others. The participants are encouraged to present their results to others. The teacher should continually look for new ways of enriching the discussions and to help the participants to find the connection between the game results and the problems in real world. The quality of this group discussion plays a relevant role in the training as it will affect the participants' transfer of knowledge and skills into the real world.

The last phase in the list above is usually called debriefing. Debriefing is the most important part of the simulation/gaming experience.&lt;ref&gt;Crookall, David (1995). Preface: Debriefing the Profession and Professionalizing Debrifing. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 7-12&lt;/ref&gt; We all learn from experience, but without reflecting on this experience the learning potential may be lost. Simulation gaming needs to be seen as contrived experiences in the learning cycle, which require special attention at the stages of reflection and generalization.&lt;ref name="Jaques, David 1995 pp. 21-38"/&gt;

Thiagarajan&lt;ref&gt;Thiagarajan, Sivasailam (1995). Guidelines for Conducting a Debriefing Session and for Developing a Debriefing Guide. In Saunders, Danny (ed.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 3: Games and Simulations for Business. Kogan Page, London, pp. 43-49&lt;/ref&gt; lists six phases of debriefing, presented as a flexible suggestion and not as rigid requirements:
# How do you feel? Gives the participants an opportunity to get some of their strong feelings about the simulation game off their chest.
# What happened? Makes it possible for the participants to compare and to contrast participant recollections and to draw some general conclusions during the next phase.
# What did you learn? Encourage the generation and testing of different hypotheses. Ask the participants to come up with general principles based on their experiences from the game and to offer evidence to support or to reject the principles.
# How does this relate to the real world? Encourage a discussion of the relevance of the game to the participants' real world workplace.
# What if…? Encourage the participants to apply their insights to new contexts.
# What next? Participants use their insights to come up with strategies for the simulation game and for the workplace.

Van Ments&lt;ref&gt;van Ments, Morry (1996). Role Playing: Playing a Part or a Mirror to Meaning. In Saunders, Percival and Vartiainen (eds.) The Simulation and Gaming Workbook Volume 4: Games and Simulations to Enhance Quality Learning. Kogan Page, London&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the aim of debriefing is to: deal with factual errors and to tie up loose ends (including scoring); draw out general conclusions about the session; and deduce general lessons which can be extrapolated to the real world. Furthermore, the participants should not be allowed to conclude what was learned without receiving feedback (Gentry, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, James W. (1990). What is Expeiential Learning? In Gentry (ed.) Guide to Business Gaming and Experiential Learning. Nichols/GP, London, pp. 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; The participants need to articulate their perception of what was learned, and the instructor needs to put things into a broader perspective. Gentry also expresses that process feedback is much more valuable than outcome feedback. As games are less-than-perfect representations of the real world, it should be the decision process used that needs to be applauded or critiqued, not the gaming outcome.
The importance of reflection, debriefing and feedback highlight the need for business simulations to supported by carefully considered learning outcomes, pedagogy and assessment tasks. Student factors such as low motivation to engage and prior skill weaknesses can undermine the ability of authentic assessment regimes to achieve the purported learning benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vos|first1=Lynn|title=Simulation games in business and marketing education: How educators assess student learning from simulations|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|date=2015|volume=13|page=16|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811715000026|accessdate=23 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Online Business Simulations Project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching has developed a range of resources to help educators embed simulations into their classes.&lt;ref name="bizsims" /&gt;

'''Computable topology''' is a discipline in mathematics that studies the topological and algebraic structure of [[computation]]. Computable topology is not to be confused with algorithmic or ''[[computational topology]]'', which studies the application of computation to topology.

==Topology of lambda calculus==

As shown by [[Alan Turing]] and [[Alonzo Church]], the [[lambda-calculus|λ-calculus]] is strong enough to describe all mechanically computable functions (see [[Church–Turing thesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1952:149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North-Holland Publishing Company. 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Lambda-calculus is thus effectively a programming language, from which other languages can be built. For this reason when considering the [[topology]] of computation it is common to focus on the topology of λ-calculus. Note that this is not necessarily a complete description of the topology of computation, since functions which are equivalent in the Church-Turing sense may still have different topologies.

The [[topology]] of λ-calculus is the [[#Scott topology|Scott topology]], and when restricted to [[continuous function]]s the type free λ-calculus amounts to a [[topological space]] reliant on the [[tree topology]]. Both the Scott and Tree topologies exhibit continuity with respect to the [[binary operators]] of application ( f ''applied to'' a = fa ) and abstraction ((λx.t(x))a = t(a)) with a modular equivalence relation based on a [[congruence relation|congruency]]. The λ-algebra describing the algebraic structure of the lambda-calculus is found to be an extension of the [[combinatory algebra]], with an element introduced to accommodate abstraction.

Type free [[λ-calculus]] treats functions as rules and does not differentiate functions and the objects which they are applied to, meaning λ-calculus is [[data type|type]] free. A by-product of type free λ-calculus is an [[effective method|effective computability]] equivalent to [[Μ-recursive_function|general recursion]] and [[Turing machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Barendregt"&gt;Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North-Holland Publishing Company. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The set of  λ-terms can be considered a functional topology in which a function space can be [[embedding|embedded]], meaning λ mappings within the space X are such that λ:X → X.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottModels"&gt;D. S. Scott. Models for the λ-calculus. Informally distributed, 1969. Notes, December 1969, Oxford Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced November 1969, [[Dana Scott]]'s untyped set theoretic model constructed a proper topology for any λ-calculus model whose function space is limited to continuous functions.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottModels" /&gt; The result of a [[Scott continuous]] λ-calculus topology is a function space built upon a programming semantic allowing fixed point combinatorics, such as the [[Fixed-point combinator#Y combinator|Y combinator]], and data types.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, M.J.C., The Denotational Description of Programming Languages. Springer Verlag, Berlin. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. S. and Strachey, C. Toward a Mathematical Semantics for Computer Languages, Proc. Symp. on Computers and Automata, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, 21, pp. 19 46. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, λ-calculus was equipped to define any sequential computation and could be easily adapted to parallel computations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berry, Sequential algorithms on concrete data structures, Theoretical Computer Science 20, 265 321 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The reducibility of all computations to λ-calculus allows these λ-topological properties to become adopted by all programming languages.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;

==Computational algebra from λ-calculus algebra==
Based on the operators within [[lambda calculus]], application and abstraction, it is possible to develop an algebra whose group structure uses application and abstraction as binary operators. Application is defined as an operation between [[lambda term]]s producing a λ-term, e.g.  the application of λ onto the lambda term ''a'' produces the lambda term ''λa''. Abstraction incorporates undefined variables by denoting λx.t(x) as the function assigning the variable ''a'' to the lambda term with value ''t(a)'' via the operation ((λ x.t(x))a = t(a)). Lastly, an [[equivalence relation]] emerges which identifies λ-terms modulo convertible terms, an example being [[beta normal form]].

==Scott topology==

The Scott topology is essential in understanding the topological structure of computation as expressed through the λ-calculus. Scott found that after constructing a function space using λ-calculus one obtains a [[Kolmogorov space]], a &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; topological space which exhibits [[pointwise convergence]], in short the [[product topology]].&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Scott. “Continuous Lattices.” Oxford University Computing Laboratory August, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the ability of self homeomorphism as well as the ability to embed every space into such a space, denoted [[Scott continuous]], as previously described which allows Scott's topology to be applicable to logic and recursive function theory. Scott approaches his derivation using a [[complete lattice]], resulting in a topology dependent on the lattice structure. It is possible to generalise Scott's theory with the use of [[complete partial order]]s. For this reason a more general understanding of the computational topology is provided through complete partial orders. We will re-iterate to familiarize ourselves with the notation to be used during the discussion of Scott topology.

Complete partial orders are defined as follows:

First, given the [[partially ordered set]] D=(D,≤), a nonempty subset ''X'' ⊆ ''D'' is ''directed'' if ∀ ''x,y'' ∈ ''X'' ∃ ''z'' ∈ ''X'' where ''x''≤ ''z'' &amp; ''y'' ≤ ''z''.

''D'' is a [[complete partial order]] (cpo) if:

::&amp;middot; Every directed X ⊆D has a [[supremum]], and:

::∃ ''bottom'' element ⊥ ∈ ''D'' such that ∀ ''x'' ∈ ''D'' ⊥ ≤ ''x''.

We are now able to define the '''Scott topology''' over a cpo (D, ≤ ).

''O'' ⊆ ''D'' is ''open'' if:

::# for x ∈ O, and x ≤ y, then y ∈ O, i.e. O is an [[upper set]].
::# for a directed set X ⊆ D, and [[supremum]](X) ∈ O, then X ∩ O ≠ ∅.

Using the Scott topological definition of open it is apparent that all topological properties are met.

::&amp;middot;∅ and D, i.e. the empty set and whole space, are open.

::&amp;middot;Arbitrary unions of open sets are open:
:::: ''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is open where i ∈ I, I being the index set. We define U = ∪{ &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; ; i ∈ I}. Take ''b'' as an element of the upper set of U, therefore a ≤ ''b''  for some ''a'' ∈ U It must be that ''a'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; for some i, likewise  ''b'' ∈ upset(&lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;). U must therefore be upper as well since &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; ∈ U.

::::Likewise, if D is a directed set with a supremum in U, then by assumption sup(D) ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_i &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;U_i &lt;/math&gt;is open. Thus there is a ''b'' ∈ D where b ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_{i} \cap D \subseteq U \cap D&lt;/math&gt;. The union of open sets &lt;math&gt; U_i &lt;/math&gt;is therefore open.

::&amp;middot;Open sets under intersection are open:
::::''Proof'': Given two open sets, ''U'' and ''V'', we define ''W'' = ''U''∩''V''. If ''W'' = ∅ then ''W'' is open. If non-empty say ''b'' ∈ upset(W) (the upper set of W), then for some ''a'' ∈ ''W'', ''a'' ≤ ''b''. Since ''a'' ∈ ''U''∩''V'', and ''b'' an element of the upper set of both ''U'' and ''V'', then ''b'' ∈ ''W''.

::::Finally, if ''D'' is a directed set with a supremum in ''W'', then by assumption sup(''D'') ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap V&lt;/math&gt;. So there is ''a'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap D&lt;/math&gt; and ''b'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;V \cap D&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''D'' is directed there is ''c'' ∈ ''D'' with &lt;math&gt;a \le c, b\le c&lt;/math&gt;; and since ''U'' and ''V'' are upper sets, ''c'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap V&lt;/math&gt; as well.  

Though not shown here, it is the case that the map &lt;math&gt;f: D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if  ''f''(sup(''X'')) = sup(''f''(''X'')) for all directed ''X''⊆''D'', where ''f''(''X'') = {''f''(''x'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X''}  and the second supremum in &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;

Before we begin explaining that application as common to λ-calculus is continuous within the Scott topology we require a certain understanding of the behavior of supremums over continuous functions as well as the conditions necessary for the product of spaces to be continuous namely

:# With &lt;math&gt;{f_i}_i \subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; be a directed family of maps, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \cup_{i}f_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; if well defined and continuous.
:# If F &lt;math&gt;\subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; is directed and cpo and &lt;math&gt; [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; a cpo where sup({''f''(''x'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''}).

We now show the continuity of ''application''. Using the definition of application as follows:

:::Ap: &lt;math&gt;[D\rightarrow D^{'}] \times D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; where ''Ap''(''f'',''x'') = ''f''(''x'').

Ap is continuous with respect to the Scott topology on the product (&lt;math&gt; [D \rightarrow D^{'}] \times D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) :

::''Proof'': λx.f(x) =  f is continuous. Let h =  λ f.f(x). For directed F&lt;math&gt;\subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt;

:: ''h''(sup(''F'')) = sup(''F'')(''x'')

:::: = sup( {''f''(''x'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''} )

:::: = sup( {''h''(''f'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''} )

:::: = sup( ''h''(''F'') )

::By definition of Scott continuity ''h'' has been shown continuous. All that is now required to prove is that ''application'' is continuous when it's separate arguments are continuous, i.e. &lt;math&gt;[D \rightarrow D^{'}] &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;D \rightarrow D^{'} &lt;/math&gt;are continuous, in our case ''f'' and ''h''.

::Now abstracting our argument to show &lt;math&gt;f:D \times  D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g = \lambda x.f(x,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=\lambda x^{'}.f(x_0,x^{'})&lt;/math&gt; as the arguments for ''D'' and &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then for a directed X ⊆ D

:: &lt;math&gt; g(\sup(X)) = f(\sup(X), x_0^{'}))&lt;/math&gt;

:::: = f( sup( (x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X} ))

:::: (since ''f'' is continuous and {(x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X}) is directed):

:::: = sup( {f(x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X} )

:::: = sup(g(X))

::g is therefore continuous. The same process can be taken to show d is continuous.
::It has now been shown application is continuous under the Scott topology.

In order to demonstrate the Scott topology is a suitable fit for λ-calculus it is necessary to prove ''abstraction'' remains continuous over the Scott topology. Once completed it will have been shown that the mathematical foundation of λ-calculus is a well defined and suitable candidate functional paradigm for the Scott topology.

With &lt;math&gt;f \in [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt; (x) =λ y ∈ &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;f(x,y)We will show:

:(i) &lt;math&gt;\check{f} &lt;/math&gt; is continuous, meaning &lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;[D \rightarrow [D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}] &lt;/math&gt;

:(ii) λ &lt;math&gt; f.\check{f}: [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]\rightarrow [D\rightarrow [D^{'}\rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

::''Proof'' (i): Let X ⊆ D be directed, then

::&lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt;(sup(X)) = λ y.f( sup(X),y )

:::: = λ y.&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x \isin X}&lt;/math&gt;( f(x,y) )

:::: = &lt;math&gt;\sup_{x \isin X}&lt;/math&gt;( λy.f(x,y) )

:::: = sup(&lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt;(X))

::''Proof'' (ii): Defining L = λ &lt;math&gt; f.\check{f} &lt;/math&gt; then for F &lt;math&gt; \subseteq [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; directed

:::: = &lt;math&gt;\sup_{y \isin F} &lt;/math&gt;λx λy.f(x,y)

:::: = sup(L(F))

It has not been demonstrated how and why the λ-calculus defines the Scott topology.

==Böhm trees and computational topology==

[[Böhm trees]], easily represented graphically, express the computational behavior of a [[lambda term]]. It is possible to predict the functionality of a given lambda expression from reference to its correlating Böhm tree.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt; Böhm trees can be seen somewhat analogous to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where the Böhm tree of a given set is similar to the continued fraction of a real number, and what is more, the Böhm tree corresponding to a sequence in [[Canonical normal form|normal form]] is finite, similar to the rational subset of the Reals.

Böhm trees are defined by a mapping of elements within a sequence of numbers with ordering (≤, lh) and a binary operator * to a set of symbols. The Böhm tree is then a relation among a set of symbols through a partial mapping ψ.

Informally Böhm trees may be conceptualized as follows:

:Given: Σ = &lt;math&gt;\perp \cup &lt;/math&gt; { λ x_{1} &lt;math&gt;\cdots &lt;/math&gt;x_{n} . y | n ∈ &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{N}, x_{1} ... x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;y are variables and denoting BT(M) as the Böhm tree for a lambda term M we then have:

:BT(M) = ⊥  if M is unsolvable (therefore a single node)
&lt;poem&gt;	
     BT(M) = λ&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;.y
                  /&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\               
     BT(&lt;math&gt; M_{1} )&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;BT(&lt;math&gt; M_{m}&lt;/math&gt; ) ; if M is solvable
&lt;/poem&gt;	
More formally:

Σ is defined as a set of symbols. The Böhm tree of a λ term M, denoted BT(M), is the Σ labelled tree defined as follows:

::If ''M'' is unsolvable:

:: &lt;math&gt; BT(M)(\langle\ \rangle) = \perp,&lt;/math&gt;

::BT(M)(&lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle *  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is unsolvable &lt;math&gt;\forall k, \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

If M is solvable, where M = λ x_{1}&lt;math&gt; \cdots x_{n}.y M_{0} \cdots M_{m-1}&lt;/math&gt;:

::BT(M)(&lt; &gt;) = λ x_{1} &lt;math&gt;\cdots x_{n}.y&lt;/math&gt;

::BT(M)(&lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle *  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) = BT(M_k)(&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and k &lt; m

:::::= undefined  &lt;math&gt;\forall  \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and k ≥ m

We may now move on to show that Böhm trees act as suitable mappings from the tree topology to the scott topology. Allowing one to see computational constructs, be it within the Scott or tree topology, as Böhm tree formations.

===Böhm tree and tree topology===

It is found that [[Böhm tree]]'s allow for a [[continuous map]]ping from the tree topology to the Scott topology. More specifically:

We begin with the cpo B = (B,⊆) on the Scott topology, with ordering of Böhm tree's denoted M⊆ N, meaning M, N are trees and M results from N. The [[tree topology]] on the set Ɣ is the smallest set allowing for a continuous map

::BT:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt;''B''.

An equivalent definition would be to say the open sets of Ɣ are the image of the inverse Böhm tree &lt;math&gt; BT^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (O) where O is Scott open in ''B''.

The applicability of the Bömh trees and the tree topology has many interesting consequences to λ-terms expressed topologically:

:Normal forms are found to exist as isolated points.

:Unsolvable λ-terms are compactification points.

:Application and abstraction, similar to the Scott topology, are continuous on the tree topology.

==Algebraic structure of computation==

New methods of interpretation of the λ-calculus are not only interesting in themselves but allow new modes of thought concerning the behaviors of computer science. The binary operator within the λ-algebra  A is application. Application is denoted &amp;middot; and is said to give structure &lt;math&gt;A=(X, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[combinatory algebra]] allows for the application operator and acts as a useful starting point but remains insufficient for the λ-calculus in being unable to express abstraction. The λ algebra becomes a combinatory algebra M combined with a syntactic operator λ* that transforms a term ''B(x,y)'', with constants in ''M'', into C(&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;)≡ λ* x.B(x,&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;). It is also possible to define an [[Algebraic extension|extension]] model to circumvent the need of the λ* operator by allowing ∀x   (fx =gx) &amp;rArr; f =g . The construction of the λ-algebra through the introduction of an abstraction operator proceeds as follows:

We must construct an algebra which allows for solutions to equations such as axy = xyy  such that a = λ xy.xyy there is need for the combinatory algebra. Relevant attributes of the combinatory algebra are:

Within combinatory algebra there exists ''applicative structures''. An applicative structure W is a combinatory algebra provided:
::&amp;middot;W is non-trival, meaning W has [[cardinality]] &gt; 1
::&amp;middot;W exhibits combinatory completeness (see [[combinatory logic|completeness of the S-K basis]]). More specifically: for every term A ∈ the set of terms of W, and &lt;math&gt; x_1, ... , x_n &lt;/math&gt; with the free variables of A within &lt;math&gt;{x_1, ... ,x_n}&lt;/math&gt; then:
::: &lt;math&gt; \exists f  \forall x_1 \cdot \cdot \cdot x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; fx_1 \cdot \cdot \cdot x_n = A &lt;/math&gt;

The combinatory algebra is:
*Never commutative
*Not associative.
*Never finite.
*Never recursive.

Combinatory algebras remain unable to act as the algebraic structure for λ-calculus, the lack of recursion being a major disadvantage. However the existence of an applicative term &lt;math&gt;A(x, \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) provides a good starting point to build a λ-calculus algebra. What is needed is the introduction of a [[lambda term]], i.e. include λx.A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

We begin by exploiting the fact that within a combinatory algebra M, with A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) within the set of terms, then:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\exists b&lt;/math&gt; s.t. bx = A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).
We then require b have a dependence on &lt;math&gt; \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt; resulting in:
:::&lt;math&gt;\forall x&lt;/math&gt; B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;)x = A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).
B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) becomes equivalent to a λ term, and is therefore suitably defined as follows:  B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}) \equiv&lt;/math&gt; λ*.

A ''pre-λ-algebra'' (pλA) can now be defined.
::pλA is an applicative structure W = (X,&amp;middot;) such that for each term A within the set of terms within W and for every x there is a term λ*x.A ∈ T(W) (T(W) ≡ the terms of W) where (the set of free variables of λ*x.A) = (the set of free variables of A) - {x}. W must also demonstrate:
::&lt;math&gt;(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; (λ*x.A)x = A
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}&lt;/math&gt;λ*x.A≡ λ*x.A[x:=y] provided y is not a free variable of A
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}&lt;/math&gt;(λ*x.A)[y:=z]≡λ*x.A[x:=y] provided y,z ≠ x and z is not a free variable of A

Before defining the full λ-algebra we must introduce the following definition for the set of λ-terms within W denoted &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt; with the following requirements:
::a ∈ W &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_{a} \isin \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt;
::x ∈ &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt; for x ∈ (&lt;math&gt; v_0, v_1, ... &lt;/math&gt;)
::M,N ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) \Rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; (MN) ∈ &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt;
::M ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (λx.M) ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt;

A mapping from the terms within &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt; to all λ terms within W, denoted '''*''' : &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)\rightarrow \Tau(W) &lt;/math&gt;, can then be designed as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;v_{i}^{*} = w_i, c_{a}^{*} = c_a &lt;/math&gt;
::(MN)* = M* N*
::(λx.M)* = λ* x*.M*

We now define ''λ''(M) to denote the extension after evaluating the terms within &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt;. 
::λx.(λy.yx)&lt;math&gt;c_a&lt;/math&gt; = λx.&lt;math&gt;c_a&lt;/math&gt;x in ''λ''(W).

Finally we obtain the full ''λ-algebra'' through the following definition:
::(1) A λ-algebra is a pλA W such that for M,N ∈ Ɣ(W):
:::''λ''(W) [[turnstile (symbol)|⊢]] M = N &amp;rArr; W ⊨ M = N.

Though arduous, the foundation has been set for a proper algebraic framework for which the λ-calculus, and therefore computation, may be investigated in a [[group theory|group theoretic]] manner.

''Computational mathematics'' may refer to two different aspect of the relation between computing and mathematics. 

Computational applied mathematics consists roughly of using mathematics for allowing and improving [[computer]] computation in [[applied mathematics]]. Computational mathematics may also refer to the use of computers for mathematics itself. This includes the use of computers for mathematical computations ([[computer algebra]]), the study of what can (and cannot) be computerized in mathematics ([[effective method]]s), which computations may be done with present technology ([[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]), and which proofs can be done on computers ([[proof assistant]]s).

Both aspects of computational mathematics involves [[mathematics|mathematical]] research in mathematics as well as in areas of science where [[computation|computing]] plays a central and essential role—that, is almost all sciences—, and emphasize algorithms, numerical methods, and [[symbolic computation]]s.&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;[[National Science Foundation]], Division of Mathematical Science, [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5390 Program description PD 06-888 Computational Mathematics], 2006.

'''Contemporary-Traditional Art''' refers to an art produced at the present period of time that reflects the current culture by utilizing classical techniques in drawing, painting, and sculpting. Practicing artists are mainly concerned with the preservation of time-honored skills in creating works of [[Figurative art|figurative]] and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] forms of fine art as a means to express human emotions and experiences. Subjects are based on the aesthetics of balancing external reality with the intuitive, internal conscience driven by emotion, philosophical thought, or the spirit. The term is used broadly to encompass all styles and practices of representational art, such as [[Classicism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], and Plein Air ([[En plein air]]) painting. Technical skills are founded in the teachings of the [[Renaissance]], [[Academic Art]], and [[American Impressionism]].

== Organizations ==
Organized groups of practicing artists and institutions dedicated to furthering classical techniques include the [[Art Renewal Center]], [[California Art Club]], [[Florence Academy of Art]], [[Laguna College of Art and Design]], Los Angeles Academy of Figurative Art, [[New York Academy of Art]], and Portrait Society of America.

[[File:Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (logo).gif|right]]
The '''Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences''' ('''CIRES''') is a research institute that is sponsored jointly by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR) and the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] (CU). CIRES scientists study the Earth system, including the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[biosphere]], and [[geosphere]], and communicate these findings to decision makers, the scientific community, and the public.

It is one of 16 NOAA Cooperative Institutes (CIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cooperative Institutes |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/ |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and research==
CIRES was established in 1967 and is the oldest and largest of NOAA’s cooperative institutes nationwide. CIRES facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at the University of Colorado and NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), [[National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service]] (NESDIS), and the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS).

CIRES includes more than 800 scientists, staff, and students, and CIRES scientists publish more than 500 [[peer review]]ed publications annually. Examples of research focused upon societal needs include monitoring changes in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es, assessing the health of Earth’s [[ozone layer]], projecting the impacts of [[climate change]] on [[water supply]] and other critical resources, documenting the thinning of [[Polar ice cap|polar ice]], monitoring the quality of the [[Air quality|air]] and [[Water quality|water]], helping to respond to [[drought]] and [[wildfire]], developing microbial agents for degrading environmental [[pollutant]]s, improving [[earthquake]] predictions, and providing decision makers with information for more effective [[risk assessment]]s.

The current director of CIRES is the former NASA Chief Scientist, [[Waleed Abdalati]].

==Divisions==
'''Cryospheric and Polar Processes Division''' ('''CPP''')
The cryosphere comprises Arctic climate, [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s, [[snow cover]] and snow hydrology, and [[permafrost]]. Cryospheric and Polar Processes Division research at CIRES combines data collection, modeling, and data analysis to understand how the cryosphere influences, and responds to, changes in the global climate.

Another major activity of this division is archiving and distributing satellite information about the cryosphere in the Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) as a part of NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) Data and Information Center. These data increase scientists’ understanding of how the cryosphere is changing and the global impacts of those changes.

'''Ecosystem Science Division''' ('''ES''')
This division research focuses on water quality, land-atmosphere exchanges, and regional and global disturbances. Research focuses on topics such as bacteria that break down environmental toxins; [[land use]] changes; nutrient and pollutant studies in lakes and streams; biogenic emissions of important [[trace gas]]es to the atmosphere; and protection of crops against [[frost]].

'''Environmental Chemistry Division''' ('''EC''')
Research topics include measurements and analysis of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds, reaction kinetics, surface science, and analytical instrumentation development. Recent studies cover wide-ranging subjects including [[acid rain]], air and water pollution like that occurring in the Denver brown cloud, and climate change resulting from emission of [[carbon dioxide]] and other pollutants. Other areas of research include stratospheric [[ozone depletion]], tropospheric photochemical oxidant formation, and the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases.

'''Environmental Observations, Modeling and Forecasting Division''' ('''EOMF''')
This division focuses on increasing understanding of interactive processes in the Earth's physical environment and developing a clearer picture of its sensitivities to natural and human-caused change. One chief area of study is the greenhouse effect and how to determine the onset of a theoretically predicted warming. 

'''Solid Earth Sciences Division''' ('''SES''')
Active research areas in [[geophysics]] include earthquake prediction; studies of the size, shape, and dynamic forces of [[Earth]]; [[isotope geochemistry]]; and the behavior of Earth’s [[Core of the Earth|core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. This research involves the use of [[seismography]], analytical and numerical modeling efforts, and [[space geodetic techniques]], such as laser ranging, artificial satellites, and interferometric observations of radio waves emanating from deep space. 

An important component of CIRES research in [[geodesy]]/[[geodynamics]] is participation in the multi-university consortium developed to assemble, test, and administer the deployment of instrument packages that use radio signals from [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites to determine distances between points on Earth’s surface. The scientific objective is to monitor crustal deformation in tectonically active areas.

'''Weather and Climate Dynamics Division''' ('''WCD''')
This division focuses on understanding how global processes are intertwined to create the [[weather]] and [[climate]] observed from the [[troposphere]] to the [[mesosphere]]. This includes observational and theoretical research on the interactive boundary layers; the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and its effects on climate prediction; global waves and [[turbulence]] in the [[stratosphere]]; and fine-scale turbulence in the [[Planetary boundary layer|boundary layer]].

==Centers and programs==
CIRES supports four centers that provide the functional link between NOAA and 11 departments at the University of Colorado Boulder. The centers include the: 
* Center for Limnology, studying lakes, streams, and wetlands; 
* Center for Science and Technology Policy Research (CSTPR), which conducts research and education to meet the needs of public and private decision makers for [[environmental science]] information; 
* Earth Science and Observation Center (ESOC), focusing on the development and application of [[remote sensing]] techniques for studying all aspects of the Earth system; 
* [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] (NSIDC), which studies Earth’s frozen realms (called the cryosphere), including floating [[sea ice]], lake ice, glaciers, ice sheets, snow cover, and permafrost.

CIRES also has two interdisciplinary programs: Western Water Assessment (WWA) and Education and Outreach. WWA is one of 11 NOAA-funded Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) programs across the country. WWA researchers, specializing in climate, water, [[ecology]], law, and the [[social sciences]], work with decision makers across the [[Western United States|West]] to produce useful, policy-relevant information about climate variability and change.

'''Cross-cultural communication''' is a field of study that looks at how people from differing [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to [[communication|communicate]] across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/home/default.aspx Japan Intercultural Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and culture==
During the [[Cold War]], the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the [[Eastern Bloc|East]] and the [[Western Bloc|West]]. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to [[Globalization#Modern|global capitalism]]. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer [[Language education|language training]] to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad.  With this also came the development of the [[Foreign Service Institute]], or FSI, through the [[Foreign Service Act]] of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, William B. Hart, &amp; Yoshitaka Miike (2002). Edward T. Hall and The History of Intercultural Communication: The United States and Japan. Keio Communication Review No. 24, 1-5. Accessible at http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2002/review24/2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; There began also implementation of a “[[world view]]” perspective in the curriculum of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 44, 48, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1974, the [[International Progress Organization]], with the support of [[UNESCO]] and under the auspices of [[Senegal]]ese President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], held an international conference on "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations" ([[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], 27–29 July 1974) which called upon [[United Nations]] member states "to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world" and "to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Köchler]] (ed.), Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations. Tübingen: Erdmann, 1978, {{ISBN|978-3-7711-0311-8}}, Final Resolution, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has become an increasing pressure for universities across the world to incorporate intercultural and international understanding and knowledge into the education of their students. &lt;ref&gt;Deardorff, D. K. (2015). A 21st Century Imperative: integrating intercultural competence in Tuning. Tuning Journal for Higher Education, 3(1), 137–147. https://doi.org/10.18543/tjhe-3(1)-2015pp137-147
&lt;/ref&gt; International literacy and cross-cultural understanding have become critical to a country’s cultural, technological, economic, and political health. It has become essential for universities to educate, or more importantly, “transform”, to function effectively and comfortably in a world characterized by close, multi-faceted relationships and permeable borders. Students must possess a certain level of global competence to understand the world they live in and how they fit into this world. This level of global competence starts at ground level- the university and its faculty- with how they generate and transmit cross-cultural knowledge and information to students.&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together the relatively unrelated fields of [[cultural anthropology]] with established areas of communication. At its core, cross-cultural communication involves understanding the ways in which culturally distinct individuals communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication requires an interdisciplinary approach. It involves literacy in fields such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as “an investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context”.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

== Global rise ==
With increasing [[globalization]] and international trade, it is unavoidable that different cultures will meet, conflict, and blend together. People from different culture find it is difficult to communicate not only due to language barriers, but also are affected by culture styles.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/#facts-and-figures| title=Fact and Figure about cross cultural training.| accessdate=3 December 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[individualistic culture]]s, such as in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, an independent figure or self is dominant. This independent figure is characterized by a sense of self relatively distinct from others and the environment. In [[Self-enhancement#Culture|interdependent cultures]], usually identified as Asian, Latin American, African, and Southern European cultures, an interdependent figure of self is dominant. There is a much greater emphasis on the interrelatedness of the individual to others and the environment; the self is meaningful only (or primarily) in the context of social relationships, duties, and roles. In some degree, the effect brought by cultural difference override the language gap. This culture style difference contributes to one of the biggest challenges for cross-culture communication. Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging. Cultures provide people with ways of thinking—ways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different cultures, even when they speak the "same" language. When the languages are different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for misunderstandings increases. The study of cross-cultural communication is a global research area.  As a result, cultural differences in the ''study'' of cross-cultural communication can already be found.  For example, cross-cultural communication is generally considered part of [[communication studies]] in the US, but is emerging as a sub-field of [[applied linguistics]] in the UK.

== Incorporation into college programs ==
The application of cross-cultural communication theory to foreign language education is increasingly appreciated around the world. Cross-cultural communication classes can now be found within foreign language departments of some universities, while other schools are placing cross-cultural communication programs in their departments of education.

With the increasing pressures and opportunities of globalization, the incorporation of international networking alliances has become an “essential mechanism for the internationalization of higher education”.&lt;ref&gt;Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities from around the world have taken great strides to increase intercultural understanding through processes of organizational change and innovations. In general, university processes revolve around four major dimensions which include: organizational change, curriculum innovation, staff development, and student mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Rudzki, R. E. J. (1995). The application of a strategic management model to the internationalization of higher education institutions. Higher Education, 29(4), 421-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellingboe emphasizes these four major dimensions with his own specifications for the internationalization process. His specifications include: (1) college leadership; (2) faculty members' international involvement in activities with colleagues, research sites, and institutions worldwide; (3) the availability, affordability, accessibility, and transferability of study abroad programs for students; (4) the presence and integration of international students, scholars, and visiting faculty into campus life; and (5) international co-curricular units (residence halls, conference planning centers, student unions, career centers, cultural immersion and language houses, student activities, and student organizations).&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"/&gt;

Above all, universities need to make sure that they are open and responsive to changes in the outside environment. In order for internationalization to be fully effective, the university (including all staff, students, curriculum, and activities) needs to be current with cultural changes, and willing to adapt to these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, K.S. (1984). Organizational adaptation and higher education. Journal of Higher Education 55(2), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Ellingboe, internationalization “is an ongoing, future-oriented, multidimensional, interdisciplinary, leadership-driven vision that involves many stakeholders working to change the internal dynamics of an institution to respond and adapt appropriately to an increasingly diverse, globally focused, ever-changing external environment".&lt;ref&gt;Ellingboe, B.J. (1998). Divisional strategies to internationalize a campus portrait: Results, resistance, and recommendations from a case study at a U.S. university, in Mestenhauser, J.A. and Ellingboe, B.J (eds.), Reforming the Higher Education Curriculum: Internationalizing the Campus. Phoenix, AZ: American Council on Education and Oryx Press, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; New distance learning technologies, such as interactive teleconferencing, enable students located thousands of miles apart to communicate and interact in a virtual classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that certain themes and images such as children, animals, life cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and may be used in international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, S.R. (2011, 11 April). Modes and models for transcending cultural differences in international classrooms. Journal of Research in International Education, 10(1), 5-27. http://jri.sagepub.com/content/10/1/5&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theories for cross-cultural communication are based on the work done looking at value differences between different cultures, especially the works of [[Edward T. Hall]], [[Richard D. Lewis]], [[Geert Hofstede]], and [[Fons Trompenaars]]. [[Clifford Geertz]] was also a contributor to this field. Also Jussi V. Koivisto's model on cultural crossing in internationally operating organizations elaborates from this base of research.

These theories have been applied to a variety of different communication theories and settings, including general business and management ([[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]]) and marketing ([[Marieke de Mooij]], [[Stephan Dahl]]). There have also been several successful educational projects which concentrate on the practical applications of these theories in cross-cultural situations.

These theories have also been criticized mainly by management scholars (e.g. [[Nigel Holden]]) for being based on the culture concept derived from 19th century cultural anthropology and emphasizing on culture-as-difference and culture-as-essence. Another criticism has been the uncritical way [[Hofstede]]’s dimensions are served up in textbooks as facts ([[Peter W. Cardon]]). There is a move to focus on 'cross-cultural interdependence' instead of the traditional views of comparative differences and similarities between cultures. Cross-cultural management is increasingly seen as a form of [[knowledge management]]. While there is debate in academia, over what cross-cultural teams can do in practice, a meta-analysis by [[Günter Stahl]], [[Martha Maznevski]], [[Andreas Voigt]] and [[Karsten Jonsen]] on research done on multicultural groups, concluded "Research suggests that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Günter|last2=Maznevski|first2=Martha|last3=Voigt|first3=Andreas|last4=Jonsen|first4=Karsten|title=Unraveling the Effects of Cultural Diversity in Teams: A Meta-Analysis of Research on Multicultural Work Groups|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=May 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=690–709|jstor=40604760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Master of Science in Management]] programs have an internationalization specialization which may place a focus on cross-cultural communication. For example, the [[Ivey Business School]] has a course titled Cross Cultural Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Cultural Management|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/msc/courses/cross-cultural-management/|website=Ivey Business School|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross cultural communication gives opportunities to share ideas, experiences, and different perspectives and perception by interacting with local people.

==International educational organizations==

===WYSE International===

[[WYSE International]] is a worldwide educational charity specializing in education and development for emerging leaders established in 1989. It is a non-governmental organization associated with the [[Department of Public Information]] of the United Nations.

Over 3000 participants from 110 countries have attended their courses, they have run in 5 continents. Its flagship International Leadership Programme is a 12-day residential course for 30 people from on average 20 different countries (aged 18 – 35).

WYSE International's website states its aims are to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"provide education independently of political, religious or social backgrounds and promote visionary leadership capable of responding to evolving world needs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyse-ngo.org/ WYSE International website&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MEET - Middle East Education through Technology===

[[MEET - Middle East Education through Technology]] is an innovative educational initiative aimed at creating a common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders. Israeli and Palestinian students are selected through an application process and work in small bi-national teams to develop technology and business projects for local impact. Through this process of cross-cultural communication, students build mutual respect, cultural competence and understanding of each others.

==Aspects==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

There are several parameters that may be perceived differently by people of different cultures:

* High- and low-context cultures: context is the most important cultural dimension and also difficult to define. The idea of context in culture was advanced by the anthropologist Edward T Hall. He divides culture into two main groups: High and Low context cultures. He refers to context as the stimuli, environment or ambiance surrounding the environment.  Depending on how a culture relies on the three points to communicate their meaning, will place them in either high or low- context cultures. For example, Hall goes on to explain that low-context cultures assume that the individuals know very little about what they are being told, and therefore must be given a lot of background information. High-context cultures assume the individual is knowledgeable about the subject and has to be given very little background information.
* Nonverbal, oral and written: the main goal behind improving intercultural audiences is to pay special attention to specific areas of communication to enhance the effectiveness of the intercultural messages. The specific areas are broken down into three sub categories: nonverbal, oral and written messages.

Nonverbal contact involves everything from something as obvious as eye contact and facial expressions to more discreet forms of expression such as the use of space. Experts have labeled the term [[kinesics]] to mean communicating through body movement. Huseman, author of ''Business Communication'', explains that the two most prominent ways of communication through kinesics are eye contact and facial expressions.

Eye contact, Huseman goes on to explain, is the key factor in setting the tone between two individuals and greatly differs in meaning between cultures. In the Americas and Western Europe, eye contact is interpreted the same way, conveying interest and honesty. People who avoid eye contact when speaking are viewed in a negative light, withholding information and lacking in general confidence. However, in the Middle East, Africa, and especially Asia, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and even challenging of one's authority. People who make eye contact, but only briefly, are seen as respectful and courteous. 

Facial expressions are their own language by comparison and universal throughout all cultures. Dale Leathers, for example, states that facial expression can communicate ten basic classes of meaning.

The final part to nonverbal communication lies in our gestures, and can be broken down into five subcategories:
* '''Emblems'''
Emblems refer to sign language (such as, thumbs up, one of the most recognized symbols in the world) 
* '''Illustrators''' 
Illustrators mimic what is spoken (such as gesturing how much time is left by holding up a certain number of fingers). 
* '''Regulators''' 
Regulators act as a way of conveying meaning through gestures (raising up a hand for instance indicates that one has a certain question about what was just said) and become more complicated since the same regulator can have different meanings across different cultures (making a circle with a hand, for instance, in the Americas means agreement, in Japan is symbolic for money, and in France conveys the notion of worthlessness). 
* '''Affect displays''' 
Affect displays reveal emotions such as happiness (through a smile) or sadness (mouth trembling, tears). 
* '''Adaptors'''
Adaptors are more subtle such as a yawn or clenching fists in anger.

The last nonverbal type of communication deals with communication through the space around people, or proxemics. Huseman goes on to explain that Hall identifies three types of space:
# Feature-fixed space: deals with how cultures arrange their space on a large scale, such as buildings and parks.  
# Semifixed feature space: deals with how space is arranged inside buildings, such as the placement of desks, chairs and plants.
# Informal space: the space and its importance, such as talking distance, how close people sit to one another and office space are all examples. A production line worker often has to make an appointment to see a supervisor, but the supervisor is free to visit the production line workers at will.

Oral and written communication is generally easier to learn, adapt and deal with in the business world for the simple fact that each language is unique. The one difficulty that comes into play is [[paralanguage]], how something is said.

==Differences between Western communication and traditional Indigenous communication==

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]],{{qualify evidence}} Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Australian Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electric car''' (also '''battery electric car''' or '''all-electric car''') is a [[plug-in electric vehicle|plug-in electric]] [[automobile]] that is propelled by one or more [[electric motor]]s, using energy typically stored in [[Electric-vehicle battery|rechargeable batteries]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US. Based on the design of the [[Electrobat|Electrobat II]], a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edisontechcenter.org/ElectricCars.html |title=History of Electric Cars |first=Galen |last=Handy |publisher=The Edison Tech Center |location=US |year=2014 |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, [[S.R. Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Six electric cars held the [[land speed record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.macscouter.com/CubScouts/PowWow07/SCCC_2007/CubScoutThemes/Jan_2008.pdf|date=January 2008|title=Cub Scout Car Show|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of them was the rocket-shaped [[La Jamais Contente]], driven by [[Camille Jenatzy]], which broke the {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} speed barrier by reaching a top speed of {{convert|105.88|km/h|abbr=on}} on 29 April 1899.

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] electric automaker [[Tesla Motors]] began development in 2004 on what would become the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], which was first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway legal [[serial production]] all-electric car to use [[lithium-ion battery]] cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=in|round=5|order=flip}} per charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/26/electric-car-history/ | title=Electric Car Evolution |first=Zachary |last= Shahan |publisher=Clean Technica |date = 2015-04-26| accessdate=2016-09-08}} ''2008: The Tesla Roadster becomes the first production electric vehicle to use lithium-ion battery cells as well as the first production electric vehicle to have a range of over 200 miles on a single charge.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental aspects==
{{Main|Environmental aspects of the electric car}}

Electric cars have several benefits over conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, including a significant reduction of local [[air pollution]], as they do not directly emit [[motor vehicle emissions|pollutants]] such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth2tech.com/2010/03/17/should-pollution-factor-into-electric-car-rollout-plans/ |title=Should Pollution Factor Into Electric Car Rollout Plans?|publisher=Earth2tech.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electroauto.com/info/pollmyth.shtml |title=Electro Automotive: FAQ on Electric Car Efficiency &amp; Pollution|publisher=Electroauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cleanairnet.org/baq2003/1496/articles-58076_resource_1.doc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914201752/http://www.cleanairnet.org/baq2003/1496/articles-58076_resource_1.doc|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-09-14|first=Anil K. |last=Raut |title=Role of electric vehicles in reducing air pollution: a case of Katmandu, Nepal |publisher=The Clean Air Initiative |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the production process and the source of the electricity to charge the vehicle, emissions may be partly shifted from cities to the material transportation, production plants and [[electricity generation|generation plants]].&lt;ref name="TwoBillion" /&gt; The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the [[emission intensity|emissions]] of the electricity source, and the efficiency of the vehicle.

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]]. Having motors connected directly to each wheel allows the wheels to be used both for propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing [[traction (engineering)|traction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Wes Siler: Comment Email Facebook Twitter |url=http://jalopnik.com/5515071/raceabout-finlands-first-electric-sports-car |title=Helsinki Metropolia University's RaceAbout |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Mike Spinelli: Comment |url=http://jalopnik.com/307457/nissan-pivo-2-360-degrees-no-reverse |title=Nissan Pivo 2 |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/plug-in-hybrid-retrofit-kit-ice-vehicle/11631/ |title=Charles Perry's Plug-In Hybrid Retrofit Kit |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not fitted with an [[axle]], [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], or [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], electric vehicles have less drive-train inertia.

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Production and [[Electric vehicle conversion|conversion]] electric cars typically use 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.17 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref name=ev1datasheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/avta/pdfs/fsev/eva_results/ev1_eva.pdf |format=PDF|year=1999|publisher=United States Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |title=Performance Statistics – 1999 General Motors EV1 w/NiMH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |date=2006-05-30 |title=Full Size Electric Vehicles |chapter=Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity |url=http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041015210239/http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |archivedate=2004-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20% of this power consumption is due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle safety===

===Hazard to pedestrians===
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

The range of production electric vehicles in 2017 ranged from {{convert|100|km|mi}} ([[Renault Twizy]]) to {{convert|540|km|mi}} ([[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S 100D]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/22/tesla-long-range-electric-car/|title=Tesla Quietly Introduces Longest-Range Electric Car on the Market|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of electric cars are fitted with a display of expected range. This may take into account many factors of how the vehicle is being used, and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual achieved range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some [[roadside assistance]] organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served "thousands" of EVs without power|work=Electrek|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charging===
{{main|Charging station}}
Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade?

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Solar cars
{{Main|Solar vehicle}}

Solar cars are electric vehicles powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]], usually, through [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s that convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy, usually used to charge a battery.

== Electric vehicle charging patents ==

Qualcomm, Hyundai, Ford, and Mitsubishi are the top patent holders of the close to 800 electric vehicle charging patents filed between 2014 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.netscribes.com/electric-vehicle-charging-technologies/|title=Electric Vehicle Charging Technology Insights {{!}} Patent Landscape|date=2018-03-06|work=Netscribes|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of patents on electric vehicle charging were filed in Japan between 2014 and 2017.

==Infrastructure==

===Charging station===

[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]]]]
{{Main|charging station}}

[[Battery electric vehicle|Battery Electric Vehicles]] are most commonly charged from the [[power grid]] overnight at the owner's house, provided they have their own charging station. The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

Charging stations can have a variety of different speeds of charging, with slower charging being more common for houses, and more powerful charging stations on public roads and areas for trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Developing Infrastructure to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles|website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW i3]] can charge 0–80% of the battery in under 30 minutes in rapid charging mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charging time for the BMW i3 |url=http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |publisher=BMW |location=UK |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921015553/http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superchargers developed by Tesla Motors provided up to 130&amp;nbsp;kW of charging, allowing a 300-mile charge in about an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/|title=How Quickly does the tesla model S battery charge?|last=Popely|first=Rick|date=November 9, 2013|website=Cars.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connectors====
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union, as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name="acea2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles |publisher=ACEA Brussels |date=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132407/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Delco Electronics]] developed the [[Magne Charge]] inductive charging system around 1998 for the [[General Motors EV1]] which was also used for the [[Chevrolet S-10 EV]] and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]] vehicles.

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas. Warming causes [[coral bleaching]], which if severe kills the coral.

===Competition===
In the [[Caribbean Sea]] and tropical [[Pacific ocean]], direct contact between coral and 40–70% of common [[seaweed]]s cause [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] and death of coral tissue via [[allelopathic]] competition. The lipid-soluble extracts of seaweeds that harmed coral tissues also produced rapid bleaching. At these sites bleaching and mortality was limited to areas of direct contact with seaweed or their extracts. The seaweed then expanded to occupy the dead coral's habitat.&lt;ref name=RasherHay10&gt;{{cite journal

Competitive seaweed and other [[algae]] thrive in nutrient-rich waters in the absence of sufficient [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[predator]]s. Herbivores include fish such as [[parrotfish]]s, [[Acanthuridae|surgeonfishes, tangs and unicornfishes]].&lt;ref name=RasherHay10/&gt;

===Predation===
{{Main|Overfishing|Environmental effects of fishing}}

[[Overfishing]], particularly selective overfishing, can unbalance coral ecosystems by encouraging the excessive growth of coral predators. Predators that eat living coral, such as the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]], are called ''corallivores''. Coral reefs are built from [[stony coral]], which evolved with large amounts of the [[wax]] [[cetyl palmitate]] in their tissues. Most predators find this wax indigestible.&lt;ref&gt;Benson AA and Muscatine L (1974) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2834385 Wax in Coral Mucus: Energy Transfer From Corals to Reef Fishes] ''Limnology and Oceanography'', '''19''' (5) 810–814. [http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_19/issue_5/0810.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt; The crown-of-thorns starfish is a large (up to one meter) starfish protected by long, venomous spines. Its [[enzyme]] system dissolves the wax in stony corals, and allows the [[starfish]] to feed on the living animal. Starfish face predators of their own, such as the [[Giant Triton|giant triton]] [[sea snail]]. However, the giant triton is valued for its [[mollusc shell|shell]] and has been over fished. As a result, crown-of-thorns starfish populations can periodically grow unchecked, devastating reefs.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Predators and Prey] ''[[PBS.org]]''.

===Fishing practices===
Although some [[marine aquarium]] fish species can reproduce in aquaria (such as [[Pomacentridae]]), most (95%) are collected from coral reefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Intense harvesting, especially in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] (including [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]), damages the reefs. This is aggravated by [[destructive fishing practices]], such as [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]] and [[blast fishing]]. Most (80–90%) aquarium fish from the Philippines are captured with [[sodium cyanide]]. This toxic chemical is dissolved in sea water and released into areas where fish shelter. It narcotizes the fish, which are then easily captured. However, most fish collected with cyanide die a few months later from [[liver]] damage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Moreover, many non-marketable specimens die in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x | title= David LECCHINI, Sandrine POLTI, Yohei NAKAMURA, Pascal MOSCONI, Makoto TSUCHIYA, Georges REMOISSENET, Serge PLANES (2006) "New perspectives on aquarium fish trade" Fisheries Science 72 (1), 40–47 | accessdate = 16 January 2007 | publisher=Blackwell Synergy |doi=10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 4,000 or more Filipino fish collectors have used over {{convert|1000000|kg}}  of cyanide on Philippine reefs alone, about 150,000&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; A major catalyst of [[cyanide fishing]] is poverty within fishing communities. In countries like the Philippines that regularly employ cyanide, more than thirty percent of the population lives below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |title=CIA—The World Factbook—Philippines |accessdate=1 February 2011 |publisher=[[CIA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070218/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dynamite]] [[fishing]] is another destructive method for gathering fish. Sticks of dynamite, [[grenade]]s, or home-made explosives are detonated in the water. This method of fishing kills the fish within the main blast area, along with many unwanted reef animals. The blast also kills the corals in the area, eliminating the reef's structure, destroying habitat for the remaining fish and other animals important for reef health.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite web
|last1=McClellan |first1=Kate |last2=Bruno |first2=John |year=2008 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Coral_degradation_through_destructive_fishing_practices
|title=Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate= 25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muroami]] is the destructive practice of covering reefs with nets and dropping large stones onto the reef to produce a flight response among the fish. The stones break and kill the coral. Muroami was generally outlawed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Fishing gear damages reefs via direct physical contact with the reef structure and substrate. Gill nets, fish traps, and anchors break branching coral and cause coral death through entanglement. When fishermen drop lines by coral reefs, the lines entangle the coral. The fisher cuts the line and abandons it, leaving it attached to the reef. The discarded lines abrade coral [[polyp]]s and upper tissue layers. Corals are able to recover from small lesions, but larger and recurrent damage complicates recovery.

Bottom dragging gear such as [[beach seine]]s can damage corals by abrasion and fracturing. A beach seine is a long net about {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} with a mesh size of {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} and a weighted line to hold the net down while it is dragged across the substrate and is one of the most destructive types of fishing gear on Kenya’s reefs.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Bottom [[trawling]] in deep oceans destroys cold–water and deep–sea corals. Historically, industrial fishers avoided coral because their nets would get caught on the reefs. In the 1980s, "rock–hopper" trawls attached large tires and rollers to allow the nets to roll over rough surfaces. Fifty-five percent of Alaskan cold–water coral that was damaged by one pass from a bottom trawl had not recovered a year later. Northeast Atlantic reefs bear scars up to {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} long. In Southern Australia, 90 percent of the surfaces on coral [[seamount]]s are now bare rock. Even in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, seafloor trawling for prawns and scallops is causing localized extinction of some coral species.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This image of an [[algae bloom]] off the southern coast of England, though not in a coral region, shows what a bloom can look like from a satellite remote sensing system.]]

Reefs in close proximity to human populations are subject to poor water quality from land- and marine-based sources. In 2006 studies suggested that approximately 80 percent of ocean pollution originates from activities on land.&lt;ref name="2006 United Nations Environment Program"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/annualreport/UNEP_AR_2006_English.pdf |format=pdf |title=UNEP in 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution arrives from land via [[Surface runoff|runoff]], the wind and "injection" (deliberate introduction, e.g., drainpipes).
Runoff brings with it sediment from [[erosion]] and land-clearing, nutrients and pesticides from agriculture, [[wastewater]], industrial [[effluent]] and miscellaneous material such as petroleum residue and trash that storms wash away. Some pollutants consume [[oxygen]] and lead to [[eutrophication]], killing coral and other reef inhabitants.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/visions/coral/side.html |publisher=[[NOAA]] |title=How Pollution Affects Coral Reefs |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing fraction of the global population lives in coastal areas. Without appropriate precautions, development (e.g., buildings and paved roads) increases the fraction of rainfall and other water sources that enter the ocean as runoff by decreasing the land's ability to absorb it.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Pollution can introduce [[pathogen]]s. For example, [[Aspergillus]] sydowii has been associated with a disease in [[sea fan]]s, and [[Serratia marcescens]], has been linked to the coral disease white pox.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Reefs in close proximity to human populations can be faced with local stresses, including poor water quality from land-based sources of pollution.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt; Copper, a common industrial pollutant has been shown to interfere with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and development of coral polyps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Young|date=February 18, 2003|title=Copper decimates coral reef spawning

[[File:Barbadosdustgraph.gif|thumb|right|250px|Barbados dust graph.]]

In addition to runoff, wind blows material into the ocean. This material may be local or from other regions. For example, dust from the [[Sahara]] moves to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]]. Dust also blows from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] [[desert]]s across [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the Northern [[Pacific]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Nutrient pollution ====
{{main|Nutrient pollution}}
[[File:Runoff from this pipe in the U.S. Virgin Islands spews directly into the ocean only a few hundred yards from reefs.jpg|left|180px|thumb]]

[[Nutrient pollution]], particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] can cause [[eutrophication]], upsetting the balance of the reef by enhancing algal growth and crowding out corals. This nutrient–rich water can enable [[algal blooms|blooms]] of fleshy [[algae]] and [[phytoplankton]] to thrive off coasts. These blooms can create [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions by using all available [[oxygen]]. Biologically available nitrogen (nitrate plus [[ammonia]]) needs to be below 1.0 [[micromole]] per liter (less than 0.014 parts per million of nitrogen), and biologically available phosphorus ([[orthophosphate]] plus dissolved organic phosphorus) needs to be below 0.1 micromole per liter (less than 0.003 parts per million of phosphorus). In addition concentrations of chlorophyll (in the microscopic plants called phytoplankton) needs to be below 0.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both plants also obscure sunlight, killing both fish and coral. High nitrate levels are specifically toxic to corals, while phosphates slow down skeletal growth.

Excess nutrients can intensify existing disease, including potentially doubling the spread of [[Aspergillosis]], a fungal infection that kills soft corals such as sea fans, and increasing yellow band disease, a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] that kills reef-building hard corals by fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak|publisher=New Scientist|date=11 January 2004|title=Sewage nutrients fuel coral disease|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4539|accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Air pollution ====
{{main|Air pollution}}
A study released in April 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of [[coral reef]]s; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions. The researchers state that the study signifies the first time that the relationship between air pollution and coral reefs has been elucidated, while former chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Ian McPhail referred to the report as "fascinating" upon the public release of its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air pollution casts a cloud over coral reef growth|url=http://theconversation.com/air-pollution-casts-a-cloud-over-coral-reef-growth-13319|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=9 April 2013|author=Liz Minchin|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine debris===
{{main|Marine debris}}
[[Marine debris]] is any solid object that enters coastal and ocean waters. Debris may arrive directly from a ship or indirectly when washed out to sea via rivers, streams, and storm drains. Human-made items tend to be the most harmful such as [[plastics]] (from [[plastic bag|bags]] to balloons, hard hats to [[fishing line]]), glass, metal, rubber (millions of [[waste tire]]s), and even entire vessels.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

[[Plastic debris]] kills several reef species. Derelict (abandoned) fishing nets and other gear—often called "ghost nets" because they still catch fish and other marine life despite being abandoned—can entangle and kill reef organisms and break or damage reefs. Even remote reef systems suffer the effects of marine debris. Reefs in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] are particularly prone to the accumulation of marine debris because of their central location in the [[North Pacific Gyre]]. From 2000 to 2006, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and partners removed over 500 tons of marine debris there.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Dredging===
{{Main|Dredging}}
[[Dredging]] operations are sometimes completed by cutting a path through a coral reef, directly destroying the reef structure and killing any organisms that live on it.&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |title=Scientists race to save coral doomed by Government Cut dredging - Environment - MiamiHerald.com |publisher=miamiherald.com |accessdate=21 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715171454/http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations that directly destroy coral are often intended to deepen or otherwise enlarge [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]] or [[canals]], due to the fact that in many areas, removal of coral requires a [[License|permit]], making it more cost-effective and simple to avoid coral reefs if possible.

Dredging also releases plumes of suspended sediment, which can settle on coral reefs, damaging them by starving them of food and sunlight. Continued exposure to dredging spoil has been shown to increase rates of diseases such as [[white syndrome]], [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]] and sediment [[necrosis]] among others.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/16/coral-reefs-face-heightened-risk-of-fatal-disease-from-dredging-says-research|title=Coral reefs face heightened risk of fatal disease from dredging, says research &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; theguardian.com|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the [[Montebello Islands|Montebello]] and [[Barrow Island (Western Australia)|Barrow Islands]] showed that the number of coral colonies with signs of poor health more than doubled in [[transects]] with high exposure to dredging sediment plumes.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102498|title=PLOS ONE: Sediment and Turbidity Associated with Offshore Dredging Increase Coral Disease Prevalence on Nearby Reefs|publisher=plosone.org|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunscreen===
[[Sunscreen]] enters the wastewater system when it is washed off and eventually reaches the ocean. Some 14,000 tons of sunscreen ends up in the ocean each year. Certain formulations of sunscreen are a serious danger to coral health. The common sunscreen ingredient [[oxybenzone]] causes coral bleaching and has an impact on other marine fauna.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/20/450276158/chemicals-in-sunscreen-are-harming-coral-reefs-says-new-study|title=Chemicals In Sunscreen Are Harming Coral Reefs, Says New Study|last=Wagner|first=Laura|date=October 20, 2015|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Akumal]], Mexico, visitors are warned not to use sunscreen and are kept out of some areas to prevent damage to the coral. In several other tourist destinations, authorities recommend the use of sunscreens prepared with the naturally occurring chemicals [[titanium dioxide]] or [[zinc oxide]], or suggest the use of clothing rather than chemicals to screen the skin from the sun.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

===Climate change===
{{Main|Climate change|Coral bleaching}}
[[File:CoralBleaching.jpg|thumbnail|right|Unbleached and [[coral bleaching|bleached coral]].]]

[[Current sea level rise|Rising sea levels due to climate change]] requires coral to grow to stay close enough to the surface to continue [[photosynthesis]]. Also, water temperature changes or disease of the coral&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; can induce [[coral bleaching]], as happened during the 1998 and 2004 [[El Niño]] years, in which [[sea surface temperature]]s rose well above normal, bleaching and killing many reefs. Bleaching may be caused by different triggers, including High sea surface temperature (SST), pollution, or other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; SST coupled with high irradiance (light intensity), triggers the loss of [[zooxanthellae]], a [[symbiotic]] single cell algae that gives the coral its color and the coral's [[dinoflagellate]] pigmentation, which turns the coral white when it is expelled, which can kill the coral. Zooxanthellae provide up to 90% of their hosts' energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Healthy reefs can often recover from bleaching if water temperatures cool.

Warming seawater may also encourage an emerging problem: coral disease. Weakened by warm water, coral is much more prone to diseases including [[black band disease]], [[white band disease]] and [[skeletal eroding band]]. If global temperatures increase by 2&amp;nbsp;°C during the twenty-first century, coral may not be able to adapt quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|left|Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water harms the ability of young clown and damsel fishes to smell and hear]]

Rising carbon dioxide levels could confuse brain signaling in fish. In 2012, researchers reported on their results after studying the behaviour of baby [[Clownfish|clown]] and [[damselfish]]es for several years in water with elevated levels of dissolved carbon dioxide, in line with what may exist by the end of the century. They found that the higher carbon dioxide disrupted a key brain [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the fish, interfering with [[neurotransmitter]] functions. The damaged central nervous systems affected fish behaviour and diminishing their sensory capacity to a point "likely to impair their chances of survival". The fishes were less able to locate reefs by smell or "detect the warning smell of a predator fish". Nor could they hear the sounds made by other reef fish, compromising their ability to locate safe reefs and avoid dangerous ones. They also lost their usual tendencies to turn to the left or right, damaging their ability to [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] with other fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/01/16/3409053.htm Carbon dioxide affecting fish brains: study] ''ABC'', 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/337677/title/Rising_carbon_dioxide_confuses_brain_signaling_in_fish Rising carbon dioxide confuses brain signaling in fish] ''Science News Online'', 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nilsson GE, Dixson DL, Domenici P, McCormick MI, Sørensen C, Watson S, Munday PL | year = 2012 | title = Near-future carbon dioxide levels alter fish behaviour by interfering with neurotransmitter function Letter | url = | journal = Nature Climate Change | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nclimate1352 |bibcode = 2012NatCC...2..201N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease===

Disease is a serious threat to many coral species. The diseases of coral may consist of bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Due to many of the dramatic changes in climate and stress caused by pollution, coral become more vulnerable to diseases. Some examples of coral disease are vibrio, white syndrome, white band, rapid wasting disease, and many more.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/detail/detail?vid=14&amp;sid=f278f495-82f3-4790-a5bf-2bf8783710ca%40sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=503444154&amp;db=scf|title=Emerging Infections on the Reefs|last=Bruckner|first=Andrew and Robin|date=1998|website=EBSCO|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diseases have different effects on the corals, ranging from damaging individual corals, killing individual coral, or even wiping out entire reefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Caribbean, white band disease is one of the primary causes for the death of over eighty percent of Staghorn and Elkhorn coral (Reef Resilience). It is a disease that can destroy miles of coral reef fast. 
A disease such as white plague can spread over a coral colony by a half an inch a day. By the time the disease has fully taken over the colony, it leaves behind a dead skeleton. Dead standing coral structures are what most people see after disease has taken over a reef.

===Other issues===

[[File:CoralSandAruba.jpg|thumb|[[Coral sand]] from a beach on [[Aruba]], [[Caribbean Sea]].]]

Within the last 20 years, once-prolific [[seagrass meadow]]s and [[mangrove forest]]s, which absorb massive amounts of nutrients and [[sediment]], have been destroyed.

[[Coral sand|Coral mining]] is another threat. Both small scale harvesting by villagers and industrial scale mining by companies are serious threats. Mining is usually done to produce construction material which is valued as much as 50% cheaper than other rocks, such as from [[quarries]].&lt;ref name="The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs"&gt;The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks are ground and mixed with other materials, like cement to make concrete. Ancient coral used for construction is known as [[coral rag]]. Building directly on the reef also takes its toll, altering water circulation and the tides which bring the nutrients to the reef. The pressing reason for building on reefs is simply lack of space.

[[File:Coral-reef-bioerosion.jpg|thumbnail|left|Eroded coral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biology.iastate.edu/intop/1Australia/Australia%20papers/Bioerosion.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030902051522/http://www.biology.iastate.edu/intop/1Australia/Australia%20papers/Bioerosion.htm |archive-date=2 September 2003 |title=Bioerosion: an essential, and often overlooked, aspect of reef ecology |date=17 April 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |author=Ryan Holl |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Boats and ships require access points into bays and islands to load and unload cargo and people. For this, parts of reefs are often chopped away to clear a path. Negative consequences can include altered water circulation and altered [[tide|tidal]] patterns which can disrupt the reef's nutrient supply; sometimes destroying a great part of the reef. [[Fishing vessel]]s and other large boats occasionally run aground on a reef. Two types of damage can result. Collision damage occurs when a coral reef is crushed and split by a vessel's hull into multiple fragments. Scarring occurs when boat propellers tear off the live coral and expose the skeleton. The physical damage can be noticed as striations. [[Mooring (watercraft)|Mooring]] causes damage which can be reduced by using mooring [[buoy]]s. Buoys can attach to the seafloor using concrete blocks as weights or by penetrating the seafloor, which further reduces damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jan03/noaa03r402.html|title=Department of Commerce Awards Bronze Medal to Florida Biologist John Halas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Tetiaroa#Future_of_Teti'aroa|reef docks]] can be used to move over goods from large, seagoing vessels to small, flat-bottomed vessels. 

Coral in Taiwan is being threatened by the influx of human population growth. Since 2007, several local environmental groups conducted research and found that much of the coral populations are being affected by untreated sewage, an influx of tourists taking corals for souvenirs, without fully understanding the destructive impact on the coral's ecological system. Researchers reported to the Taiwanese government that many coral populations have turned black in the southeast coast of Taiwan. Potentially, this could lead to loss of food supply, medicinal sources and tourism due to the breakdown of the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, R. (Feb. 6, 2009).

==Threatened species==
The global standard for recording [[threatened species|threatened]] marine species is the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction The 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706005808/http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction |date=July 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is the foundation for marine conservation priorities worldwide. A species is listed in the threatened category if it is considered to be [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]], [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Other categories are [[near threatened]] and [[data deficient]]. By 2008, the [[IUCN]] had assessed all 845 known reef-building corals species, marking 27% as [[threatened species|Threatened]] 20% as [[near threatened]] and 17% as [[data deficient]].&lt;ref name="IUCN factsheet"&gt;[[IUCN]]: [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/status_of_the_world_s_marine_species.pdf Status of the world's marine species]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coral Triangle|coral triangle]] (Indo-Malay-Philippine archipelago) region has the highest number of reef-building coral species in threatened category as well as the highest coral species diversity.

==History==
[[File:GeologicalSurveyIndia1870.jpg|thumb|left|Earliest members of the [[Geological Survey of India|GSI]] and [[British Geological Survey|BGS]] in 1851.]]

As early as 1836–51, the [[British monarchy|British crown]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] decided to set up the geological survey to explore the [[British Indian Empire]] under the British geologist [[David Hiram Williams|David Williams]] who later founded the [[Geological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0007/bsb00079409/images/ copy in Bavarian State Library (also Horizontal and Vertical Sections)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan from the [[British Indian Empire]], the [[Geological Survey of India]]'s north-west branch, staff and assets were evolved into creating to Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP).&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"&gt;{{cite book|last=editor|first=Richard J. Ward|title=The challenge of development : theory and practice in human resource management|year=2008|publisher=AldineTransaction|location=Piscataway, N.J.|isbn=978-0202362267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQypxEfL8XEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=geological+survey+of+pakistan+1947#v=onepage&amp;q=geological%20survey%20of%20pakistan%201947&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its establishment, the GSP had consisted of only six geologist and two [[chemist]]s under British scientist H.L. Crookshank, who was at that time was the most senior scientist working.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; Immediately, H.L. Crookshank was appointed first director general of GSP which he remained until 1955. Under Crookshank, the technical staff was increased to 30 geoscientists in 1948.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In its formative years, the GSP did the pioneering work in hydrogeology and [[Engineering geology|engineering]] but the efforts were transfer to engineering units of the [[Pakistan Military|military]].&lt;ref name="archives of the GSP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff editor |title=Historical perspective |url=http://gsp.gov.pk/about/historical_prespective.html |work=Govt.

Due to these activities, it increased the operational, scientific capabilities, and expansion of facilities of the GSP by 1956; it became one of the pioneering scientific institution of the government.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt; In 1955, English geologist, E.R. Gee, took over the GSP who initiated a massive expansion programme for GSP, including engineering, photogeology sections, as well as systematic publications journals were established. In 1959, the construction of new headquarters in [[Quetta]] was completed with Dr. N.M. Khan becoming first native GSP's director.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

[[File:Paktopo de.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Topographic map]] of Pakistan.]]

By 1956, the GSP worked extremely close with the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS); the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] established multimillion-dollar work laboratories and facilities in all over the country and cooperation continued until 1970.&lt;ref name="Department of Interior, Department of State and Geological Survey of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calkins|first=James A.|author2=S.

H. Nayyar|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the GSP helped established country's [[Universities in Pakistan|universities]] to teach geoscience and engineering as part of their university programmes.&lt;ref name="AldineTransaction"/&gt;

In the 1970s, due to its expansion and scientific capabilities, the GSP was instrumental in carrying out work on nuclear geography, when its scientists frequently visited in various [[Mountain ranges of Pakistan|mountain ranges]] of the country.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; The GSP notably carried out an ingenious work on nuclear geology and geography as part of the clandestine [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb project]], and played an integral role in the selection of the test sites.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saleh|first=R. M.|title=When Mountain Moves|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/|accessdate=14 January 2014|newspaper=The Nation|date=9 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, the GSP's scientists continued exploring [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], as well as other material sources in all over the country.&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"/&gt;

In 1992, The GSP announced the discovery of the [[Thar coalfield|huge deposits]] of [[coal]] at [[Thar Desert]] in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C."&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=editor and writers|title=Thar Coal Power Generation|url=http://www.embassyofpakistanusa.org/forms/Thar%20Coal%20Power%20Generation.pdf|work=Govt of Pakistan|publisher=Embassy of Pakistan, Washington D.C.|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GSP sponsored and published various studies on the geology of Thar Desert.&lt;ref name="GSP, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Discovery Of Ignite Coal In Thar Desert|url=http://www.gsp.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30:thar-coal&amp;catid=1:data|work=Govt.

In the 2000s, the GSP gained international and public prominence when its scientists discovered and unearthed the first ever dinosaur fossils in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The remains were thought to be around  ~70 million years old and were found by geologists mapping the Barkhan district of the country's arid Balochistan province.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"/&gt; The specimens include legs and vertebrae.&lt;ref name="BBC Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=First dinosaur find in Pakistan|newspaper=BBC Pakistan|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accelerated increase in environment===
{{Main article|2005 Pakistan earthquake|2010 Pakistan floods|2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche}}

In 2006, the Geological Survey's two scientists published an assessed report, predicting the [[2010 Pakistan floods|hydrological threat]] posed to the country.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=David|title=Flash flood threat to Pakistan quake survivors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/feb/11/pakistan.naturaldisasters|accessdate=18 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey was conducted immediately after the [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|devastated earthquake]] in 2005, and the GSP's scientists began to study the hazards in the region, which were still geologically unstable.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

In 2009, the GSP submitted another report that recommended the potentially hazardous areas of [[Northern Pakistan]] where the earthquake and seismic activities were suspected. The survey also found out that the earthquake cracks were found in all over the [[Atta Abad lake]] region. The GSP declared the eastern part of the [[Atta Abad lake|Atta Abad]] as "High Hazard" area, and recommendations were submitted to evacuate the area.&lt;ref name="GSP Pakistan, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Causative Mechanisms of Hunza Valley|url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/Documents/Hunza_Landslide_Report/Report%20of%20Geological%20Survey%20of%20Pakistan%20in%20Pre%20disaster%20period%20of%20Hunza%20Attabad%20Landslide.pdf|publisher=GSP Pakistan, 2009|accessdate=18 January 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Folta's laboratory has two primary research areas: [[photomorphogenesis|controlling plant traits using light]], and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits.

=== Plants and light ===
Folta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the [[phytochrome]] response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' through [[cryptochrome]] and [[phototropin]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Plant Journal | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=471–478 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x | last1=Folta | first1=Kevin M. | last2=Spalding | first2=Edgar P. | title=Unexpected roles for cryptochrome 2 and phototropin revealed by high-resolution analysis of blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition. | date=2001 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x/full | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=EurekAlert! | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/ajob-sjf010213.php | title=Scientists join forces to bring plant movement to light | author=American Journal of Botany | date=2 January 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in plant biology would later extend to using [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futurity.org/fruit-could-taste-better-with-far-red-light/ | work=Futurity | title=Fruit Could Taste Better With Far-Red Light | last=Anderson-Florida | first=Mickie | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through [[photomorphogenesis]]. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.&lt;ref name="Decoded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.decodedscience.org/controlling-plants-light-leds-change-plant-growth/39190 | title=Controlling Plants with Light: LEDs to Change Plant Growth | work=Decoded Science | last=Latchman | first=David | date=19 November 2013 | accessdate=2 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification,&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2013-07-flavor-scent-volatiles-fruits.html | title=Light can change flavor, scent volatiles in plants and fruits, study finds | author=[[University of Florida]] | work=[[Phys.org]] | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawberry genomics and flavors ===
Folta's work in [[strawberry]] genomics began in 2002.&lt;ref name="ufgi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sharing science: Kevin Folta’s career in horticulture, research advocacy | url=http://ufgi.ufl.edu/sharing-science-kevin-foltas-career-in-horticulture-research-advocacy/ | first=Ellison | last=Langford |  work=University of Florida Genetics Institute | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShulaevSargent2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shulaev|first1=Vladimir|display-authors=et al. |title=The genome of woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca)|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=109–116|issn=1061-4036|doi=10.1038/ng.740|pmid=21186353|pmc=3326587}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

Folta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor.&lt;ref name="LS 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/10932-future-flavor-strawberry-genetic-code-sequenced.html | title=The Future of Flavor: Strawberry's Genetic Code Sequenced | work=[[LiveScience]] | last=Parry | first=Wynne | date=26 December 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/bland-strawberries-genetic-tweak-flavor-204757153.html | title=Bland Strawberries Get a Genetic Tweak for Flavor | work=[[Yahoo! News]] | last=Perry | first=Wynne | date=4 February 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as [[grape]]s and [[pineapple]]s, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UF 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2014/03/healthier-processed-food-essence-of-strawberry-could-be-the-key.html | title=Healthier processed food? Essence of strawberry could be the key | work=[[University of Florida]] | last=Anderson | first=Mickie | date=3 March 2014 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] such as [[peach]]es, [[almond]]s, [[apple]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[blackberry|blackberries]],&lt;ref name="LS 2010" /&gt; and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar.&lt;ref name="UF 2014" /&gt; Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using [[selective breeding|conventional breeding techniques]], without the use of genetic modification.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;

== Science communication ==
[[File:Kevin Folta.jpg|thumb|[[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 8 in 2010]]
Folta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions.&lt;ref name="TB bio" /&gt; He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.&lt;ref name="TB bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | work=Talking Biotech (blog) | title=Instructor — Talking Biotech | accessdate=28 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233020/http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | archivedate=20 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' described Folta as "a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

In 2016, Folta was awarded the [[Borlaug CAST Communication Award]] by the [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Norman Borlaug]]. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on "clear, credible information" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, "[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology."&lt;ref name=CAST/&gt; Writing about the award in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta "wants to replace fear with fact" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Jack|title=Good science conquers greatest fear: the unknown|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/10/11/good-science-conquers-greatest-fear-unknown/91911900/|website=The DesMoines Register|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science "won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth."&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=This is Genetic Engineering 2.0|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/this_is_genetic_engineering_2.0|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Skeptical Inquirer|issue=July/August 2017|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has compared the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the safety of [[genetically modified organisms|genetically modified foods]] to those regarding [[global warming]] and [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/anti-gmo-activist-seeks-expose-emails-food-scientists/ | title=Anti-GMO Activist Seeks to Expose Scientists' Emails With Big Ag | work=Wired | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | last=Levinovitz |  first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an outspoken critic of food blogger [[Vani Hari]]'s claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-food-babe-enemy-of-chemicals/385301/ | title=The Food Babe: Enemy of Chemicals | work=The Atlantic | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Hamblin, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta advocates for a "soft and effective" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="Fear mongers" make good living by misrepresenting science, says GMO expert | url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2015/09/fear-mongers-make-a-good-living-off-of-misrepresenting-science-says-gmo-expert/ | accessdate=23 September 2015 | work=[[McGill Reporter]] | date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta regards the term "GMO" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term "genetic engineering".&lt;ref name="GerbicCSICOP2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=The Challenges of Science Communication: An Interview with Kevin Folta|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|website=CSICOP.org|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|archivedate=8 November 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's  recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Jarry|title=An interview with Kevin Folta at CSICon|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_kevin_folta_at_csicon|website=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)|publisher=CSICOP, an independent nonprofit organization|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: "Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017 /&gt;

===Podcasting===
Folta operates the ''Talking Biotech'' [[podcast]] which is billed as "A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genome Center Director features in ‘Talking Biotech’ podcast | website=UC Davis Genome Center | url=http://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/2015/07/29/genome-center-director-features-in-talking-biotech-podcast/ | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Talking Biotech Podcast | url=http://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com | title=Talking Biotech Podcast - Evidence-Based Discussion with Dr. Kevin Folta | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also created the ''Science Power Hour'' podcast, which is a [[parody]] of an [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[talk radio]] show hosted by Folta's alter ego "Vern Blazek". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is VB?|url=http://www.sciencepowerhour.com/?page_id=124|website=sciencepowerhour.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seed Money|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/brookeborel/when-scientists-email-monsanto|accessdate=1 February 2016|publisher=buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict of interest allegations ==
In February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an [[Oakland, California]]-based group whose sole major funder is the [[Organic Consumers Association]],&lt;ref name="Kloor"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Keith Kloor | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/02/agricultural-researchers-rattled-demands-documents-group-opposed-gm | title=Updated: Agricultural researchers rattled by demands for documents from group opposed to GM foods | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Folta told ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to "smear" him.&lt;ref name="Kloor"/&gt;

In a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article from August 2015 [[Keith Kloor]] wrote that Folta had "close ties to [[Monsanto]] and other biotechnology interests".&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Folta denied these claims,&lt;ref name=ihe&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/14/researcher-finds-himself-center-battle-over-gmos-and-corporate-support | title=Casualty of GMO Wars | work=Inside Higher Education | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Flaherty, Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014.&lt;ref name=kfolta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-are-deep-ties-to-monsanto.html| title= What are "Deep Ties" to Monsanto? | work=Illumination (blog)| date=13 September 2015 | accessdate=13 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s20&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science20.com/kevin_folta/setting_a_new_standard_for_science_transparency-157244 | title= Setting A New Standard For Science Transparency | work=Science 2.0 | date=22 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.&lt;ref name=ihe/&gt;

In September 2015, [[Eric Lipton]] writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their "independent voices" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/us/food-industry-enlisted-academics-in-gmo-lobbying-war-emails-show.html | title=Food Industry Enlisted Academics in G.M.O.

Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food.&lt;ref name=kfolta/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20150828/articles/150829661 |title= UF to donate Monsanto funds to food pantry | work=Gainesville Sun | date=28 August 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | author=Schweers, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt;&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt; Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says "defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;

In October 2015, ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' wrote that scientists like Folta have been "targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology" and stated that the funds "were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain." The journal criticized the journalists for "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]]" and creating "hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]]| department=Editorial| title=Standing up for science | year=2015| issue=10| volume=33| pages=1009| publisher=Nature Publishing Group| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3384| accessdate=10 October 2015| doi=10.1038/nbt.3384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a "[[spiral of silence]]".&lt;ref name=tampa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/perspective-records-requests-hijack-scientists-time/2245131 | title=Perspective: Records requests hijack scientists' time| work= Tampa Bay Times | date=12 September 2015 | accessdate=12 September 2015 | author=Payne, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretchen Goldman, writing for the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being "overly wide", saying it would create "chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science."&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/no-scientist-should-face-harassment-period-637| title=No Scientist Should Face Harassment.

Professor and science communicator [[Steven Novella]] wrote that "The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues."&lt;ref name="neurologica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/how-to-attack-a-public-scientist/ | title=How To Attack a Public Scientist| work=Neurologica (blog) | date=11 September 2015 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Novella,Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During college Folta was a member of many bands. The oddest was named "Red Lobster Cult", but the one he played with the longest was "Insane War Tomatoes", according to Folta, "One of the greatest bands to ever miss the mark&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;it was a unique show at a time when uniqueness wasn't wanted."&lt;ref name="Enthusiast interview"&gt;{{cite podcast | title=tSE 015 – Kevin Folta, Chairman of Horticultural Sciences at University of Florida | url=http://ascienceenthusiast.com/ep015/ | website=A Science Enthusiast | time=35:15–45:50 | date=August 31, 2016 | accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He trained and competed in [[karate]] for many years, and he won a bronze metal in [[kumite]] (sparring) at the 2012 [[USA National Karate-do Federation]] national tournament (over 45 Masters division).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tournament Results: 2012 USA Karate Nationals|url=http://www.teamusa.org/~/media/USA_Karate/Documents/Event-Results/2012-Nationals.pdf?la=en|publisher=[[USA National Karate-do Federation]]|accessdate=5 November 2016|page=50|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cats having sex in Israel.jpg|thumb|Lordosis behavior by a female cat during copulation]]

'''Lordosis behavior''', also known as '''mammalian lordosis''' (Greek lordōsis, from ''lordos'' "bent backward"&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary - lordosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=lordosis|publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary|title=lordosis|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''presenting''', is the naturally occurring body posture for sexual receptivity to [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] present in most mammals including [[rodents]], [[elephants]], and [[felines]]. The primary characteristics of the behavior are a lowering of the forelimbs but with the rear limbs extended and [[hip]]s raised, [[ventral]] arching of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and a raising, or sideward displacement, of the [[tail]]. During lordosis, the spine curves [[dorsoventral]]ly so that its apex points towards the abdomen.

The lordosis [[Reflex arc|reflex]] is hardwired in the brain, controlled by [[hormone]]s in the [[hypothalamus]],&lt;ref name="flanagan"/&gt; triggered by [[Somatosensory system|touch]] stimuli on [[Flank (anatomy)|flanks]], [[Rump (animal)|rump]], tailbase or [[perineum]],&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt; and facilitated by vaginal stimulation&lt;ref name="gonzalez2007"/&gt; and by sexual [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="haga2010"/&gt;

==Description==
Lordosis is a reflex action that causes many non-primate female mammals to adopt a body position that is often crucial to reproductive behavior. The posture moves the [[pelvic tilt]] in an anterior direction, with the posterior pelvis rising up, the bottom angling backward and the front angling downward. Lordosis aids in copulation as it elevates the hips, thereby facilitating penetration by the [[penis]]. It is commonly seen in female mammals during [[estrus]] (being "in heat"). Lordosis occurs during copulation itself and in some species, like cat, during pre-[[animal sexual behavior|copulatory]] behavior.

==Neurobiology==
[[File:Simplified diagram of the neurobiological circuits of female mammals sexual behavior.png|thumb|700px|left|Simplified diagram of the neurobiological circuits modulating lordosis.&lt;ref name="pheromone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moncho2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;]] {{clear}}

Lordosis [[brain]] circuits are connected with other [[Instinct|innate]] sexual circuits, especially [[Olfactory system|olfactory circuits]] and [[reward system]].

In female, the main neurobiological processes of reproductive behaviour are:

More precisely, the lordosis sexual [[Reflex arc|reflex]] is mainly hardwired in the spinal cord, at the level of the lumbar and sacral [[Vertebra (anatomy)|vertebrae]] (L1, L2, L5, L6 and S1).&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt; In the brain, several regions modulate the lordosis reflex. The [[vestibular nuclei]] and the [[cerebellum]], via the vestibular tract, send information which makes it possible to coordinate the lordosis reflex with [[Equilibrioception|postural balance]]. More importantly, the ventromedial [[hypothalamus]] sends projections that inhibit the reflex at the spinal level. For this reason, in general, the lordosis reflex is not functional.&lt;ref name="Kow2007"/&gt; Sex hormones control reproduction and coordinate sexual activity with the physiological state. Schematically, at the [[breeding season]], and when an [[ovum]] is available, hormones (especially [[estrogen]]) simultaneously induce [[ovulation]] and [[estrus]] (heat). Under the action of estrogen in the hypothalamus, the lordosis reflex is uninhibited.&lt;ref name="flanagan"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flanagan-Cato L.M. | year = 2011 | title = Sex differences in the neural circuit that mediates female sexual receptivity | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 124–136 | pmc=3085563 | pmid=21338620 | doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female is ready for copulation and [[fertilization]].

During the copulation, when a male approaches the female, male pheromones (part 1 of the above diagram) are detected by the olfactory circuits (part 2). The pheromonal signals stimulate, among other things, the hypothalamus, which facilitates the lordosis reflex.&lt;ref name="haga2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haga S., Hattori T., Sato T., Sato K., Matsuda S., Kobayakawa R., Sakano H., Yoshihara Y., Kikusui T., Touhara K. | year = 2010 | title = The male mouse pheromone ESP1 enhances female sexual receptive behaviour through a specific vomeronasal receptor | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Koji_Sato4/publication/44902518_The_male_mouse_pheromone_ESP1_enhances_female_sexual_receptive_behaviour_through_a_specific_vomeronasal_receptor/links/542a53a70cf29bbc12678065.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 7302| pages = 118–122 | doi=10.1038/nature09142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then when the male mounts the female (part 3), tactile stimuli on the flanks, the [[perineum]] and the [[Rump (animal)|rump]] of the female are transmitted via the [[sensory nerve]]s in the [[spinal cord]]. In the spinal cord and lower [[brainstem]], they are integrated with the information coming from the brain, and then, in general, a [[Action potential|nerve impulse]] is transmitted to the [[muscle]]s via the [[motor nerve]]s. The contraction of the longissimus and transverso-spinalis muscles causes the ventral arching of the vertebral column (part 4).&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt; The lordosis position which results from it makes it possible to present properly the vagina to the male (part 5), facilitating penile intromission. Then, during intromission, tactile and deep sensations from the genital area and [[clitoris]] accentuate the lordosis reflex (part 6).&lt;ref name="gonzalez2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gonzalez-Flores O., Beyer C., Lima-Hernandez F.J., Gomora-Arrati P., Gomez-Camarillo M.A., Hoffman K., Etgen A.M. | year = 2007 | title = Facilitation of estrous behavior by vaginal cervical stimulation in female rats involves alpha1-adrenergic receptor activation of the nitric oxide pathway | journal = Behavioural Brain Research | volume = 176 | issue = 2| pages = 237–243 | pmc=1810388 | pmid=17095102 | doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2006.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus observed that the physiological and neurobiological organization of the lordosis behavior reflex is specifically adapted to heterosexual [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]].

== Hormonal and cerebral regulation of lordosis ==
Sexual behaviour is optimized for reproduction, and the [[hypothalamus]] is the key brain area which regulates and coordinates the physiological and behavioural aspects of reproduction.&lt;ref name="Plant"&gt;Plant T., Zeleznik A. (Eds). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I1ACBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction]''. Academic Press, 4th edition, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, the [[ventromedial nucleus]] of the hypothalamus (VMN) inhibit lordosis. But when environmental conditions are favorable and the female is in estrus, the [[estrogen]] [[hormone]], [[estradiol]], induces [[sexual receptivity]] by the [[neuron]]s in the [[ventromedial nucleus]],&lt;ref name="pmid9638959"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kow LM, Pfaff DW |title=Mapping of neural and signal transduction pathways for lordosis in the search for estrogen actions on the central nervous system |journal=Behav. Brain Res. |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=169–180 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9638959 |doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(97)00189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[periaqueductal gray]], and other areas of the [[brain]]. The ventromedial hypothalamus sends impulses down [[axon]]s synapsing with neurons in the periaqueductal gray. These convey an impulse to neurons in the medullary [[reticular formation]] which project down the [[reticulospinal tract]] and synapse with the neurobiological circuits of the lordosis reflex in the [[spinal cord]] (L1–L6). These neurobiological processes induced by estradiol enable the tactile stimuli to trigger lordosis.

The mechanisms of regulation of this [[Estrogen-dependent condition|estrogen-dependent]] lordosis reflex have been identified through different types of [[experiment]]s. When the VMN is lesioned lordosis is abolished; this suggests the importance of this cerebral structure in the regulation of lordosis.

Increased [[Evolution of the brain|corticalization]] of the brain induces several changes in the control of sexual behavior, including lordosis behavior.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"&gt;Wunsch S.

These changes induced an evolution of the stereotyped [[Reflex arc|reflex]] sexual behaviors of non-human mammals to "the astounding variety of human sexual behaviors".&lt;ref name="agmo" /&gt; From the anthropoids onwards ([[simian]]s/monkeys) there is a gradual loss of the lordotic reflex, in parallel with the loss of major hormone effects and [[Estrous cycle|estrus]].&lt;ref name="Dixson"&gt;Dixson A.F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=khzhd2nXWM0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Primate sexuality: Comparative studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings]''. Oxford University Press, 2nd edition, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Cercopithecidae]] ([[macaque]]s, etc.), the lordotic reflex is still functional, but it is part of sexual and sociosexual activities such as presenting. This sociosexual presenting (which follows the same sequence as lordosis: curvature of the back and lateral movement of the tail, which presents the genital region to view) is no longer dependent on hormonal control, but occurs in response to a social situation.&lt;ref name="Hanby"&gt;Hanby J.P. "Sociosexual development in primates." in Bateson P.P. (Ed). ''Perspectives in Ethology'', volume 2. Plenum Press, (1):1–67, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hominidae]], lordosis and immobilisation are absent, even during the phase around [[ovulation]]. Female receptiveness is neither obligatory nor passive. The female can actively avoid or refuse the male, or can terminate the encounter.&lt;ref name="Dixson" /&gt;

== In humans==
As a result of these evolved differences, lordosis behavior becomes secondary in [[hominidae]] and is apparently non functional in humans. There is no human analogue to the lordosis reflex, although lordosis-like positions can be observed in women being mounted from behind.&lt;ref name="Pfaus"&gt;Pfaus, J. G.; Flanagan-Cato, L. M.; Blaustein, J. D. "Female sexual behavior". in Plant T., Zeleznik A. (Eds). ''Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction''. Academic Press, 4th edition, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman gets onto all fours, curves her back and remains still, it is no longer a reflex movement triggered by sexual stimuli, but a voluntary movement.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt; In women, the motor reflexes involved in copulation have been replaced by new sexual activities, several of which have nothing to do with [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]] nor fertilisation. Unlike lordosis, human sexual activities ([[kiss]]ing, mutual [[masturbation]], [[fellatio]], face-to-face coitus, etc.) are not motor [[Reflex arc|reflexes]], but are mostly voluntary and learned activities, in order to obtain sexual [[Reward system|rewards]].&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunsch2007"&gt;Wunsch, S.

In [[psychology]], '''meaning-making''' is the process of how people [[Construals|construe]], [[Understanding|understand]], or make sense of life events, relationships, and the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ignelzi|2000|p=5}}: "Meaning-making, the process of how individuals make sense of knowledge, experience, relationships, and the self, must be considered in designing college curricular environments supportive of learning and development." {{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|p=208}}: Through meaning-making, people are "retaining, reaffirming, revising, or replacing elements of their orienting system to develop more nuanced, complex and useful systems".&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is widely used in [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] approaches to [[counseling psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Kegan|1980}}; {{harvnb|Kegan|1982}}; {{harvnb|Carlsen|1988}}; {{harvnb|Dorpat|Miller|1992}}; {{harvnb|Drath|Palus|1994}}; {{harvnb|Rosen|Kuehlwein|1996}}; {{harvnb|Basseches|1997}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|Raskin|2000}}; {{harvnb|Mackay|2003}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during [[Grief|bereavement]] in which people attribute some sort of meaning to an experienced [[death]] or loss.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Epting|Neimeyer|1984}}; {{harvnb|Attig|1996}}; {{harvnb|Doka|Davidson|1998}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Kalayjian|Eugene|2010}}; {{harvnb|Dyregrov|Dieserud|Hjelmeland|Straiton|2011}}; {{harvnb|Steffen|Coyle|2011}}; {{harvnb|Neimeyer|2012}}; {{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in [[educational psychology]].&lt;ref name="edu-refs"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969}}; {{harvnb|Novak|1993}}; {{harvnb|Merriam|Heuer|1996}}; {{harvnb|Rehm|1999}}; {{harvnb|Ignelzi|2000}}; {{harvnb|Kunnen|Bosma|2000}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|Scott|2003}}; {{harvnb|Wickman|2006}}; {{harvnb|Scott|Mortimer|Aguiar|2006}}; {{harvnb|Nash|Murray|2010}}; {{harvnb|Baxter Magolda|King|2012}}; {{harvnb|Fantozzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, meaning-making is the main research object of [[semiotics]], [[biosemiotics]], and other fields.&lt;ref name="Thibault"/&gt; '''Social meaning-making'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the main research object of [[social semiotics]] and related disciplines.&lt;ref name="Thibault"&gt;{{harvnb|Thibault|2003|p=41}}: "...&amp;nbsp;the description of a community's communicative practices cannot adequately be accomplished within the confines of any single discipline in the human and social sciences. Such an enterprise is necessarily a transdisciplinary one, drawing on the insights of sociology, ethnology, linguistics, anthropology, social psychology, and so on, in order to develop a unified conceptual framework for talking about social meaning-making (Gumperz 1992)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Viktor Frankl2.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Frankl]], author of ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'']]
[[Psychiatrist]] and [[holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]], founder of [[logotherapy]] in the 1940s, posited in his 1946 book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' that the primary motivation of a person is to discover meaning in life.&lt;ref name="Frankl"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankl|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frankl insisted that meaning can be discovered under all circumstances, even in the most miserable experiences of loss and tragedy. He said that people could discover meaning through doing a deed, experiencing a value, and experiencing suffering. Although Frankl did not use the term "meaning-making", his emphasis on the making of meaning influenced later psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;A [//scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3A%22V+Frankl%22 Google Scholar search for citations of Frankl's work] shows that ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' is cited by some of the most influential psychologists and psychotherapists of the 20th century; it is cited in [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''; [[Albert Ellis]]'s ''New Guide to Rational Living''; [[Richard S. Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman's ''Stress, Appraisal, and Coping''; [[Carl Rogers]]'s ''Freedom to Learn''; and thousands of other texts.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner, both of whom were educational critics and promoters of [[inquiry education]], published a chapter called "Meaning Making" in their 1969 book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter, they described why they preferred the term "meaning making" to any other metaphors for teaching and learning:

{{Quote|text=In the light of all this, perhaps you will understand why we prefer the metaphor "meaning making" to most of the metaphors of the mind that are operative in the schools. It is, to begin with, much less static than the others. It stresses a process view of minding, including the fact that "minding" is undergoing constant change. "Meaning making" also forces us to focus on the individuality and the uniqueness of the meaning ''maker'' (the ''minder''). In most of the other metaphors there is an assumption of "sameness" in all learners. The "garden" to be cultivated, the darkness to be lighted, the foundation to be built upon, the clay to be molded—there is always the implication that all learning will occur in the same way. The flowers will be the same color, the light will reveal the same room, the clay will take the same shape, and so on. Moreover, such metaphors imply boundaries, a limit to learning. How many flowers can a garden hold? How much water can a bucket take? What happens to the learner after his mind has been molded? How large can a building be, even if constructed on a solid foundation? The "meaning maker" has no such limitation. There is no end to his educative process. He continues to create new meanings... |author=[[Neil Postman]] and Charles Weingartner |source="Meaning Making"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postman|Weingartner|1969|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the end of the 1970s, the term "meaning-making" was used with increasing frequency,&lt;ref&gt;As can be seen in a [//books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=meaning-making&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2020&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3 Google Ngram of the term "meaning-making"] in [[Google Ngram Viewer]], usage of the term "meaning-making" in the [[Google Books]] database jumps just before 1980 and increases thereafter.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist learning theory]] which posits that knowledge is something that is actively created by people as they experience new things and integrate new information with their current knowledge.&lt;ref name="edu-refs"/&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]] [[Robert Kegan]] used the term "meaning-making" as a key concept in several widely cited texts on counseling and human development published in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Kegan"&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Kegan|1980}}; {{harvnb|Kegan|1982}}; {{harvnb|Fantozzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegan wrote: "''Human'' being is ''meaning making''. For the human, what ''evolving'' amounts to is ''the evolving of systems of meaning''; the business of organisms is to organize, as [[William G. Perry|Perry]] (1970) says."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kegan|1980|p=374}}; Kegan was referencing {{harvnb|Perry|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "meaning-making" has also been used by psychologists influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]]'s [[personal construct theory]].&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Epting|Neimeyer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the meaning-making literature published in 2010, psychologist Crystal L. Park noted that there was a rich body of theory on meaning-making, but [[empirical research]] had not kept pace with theory development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Park|2010|pp=290–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the first Congress on the Construction of Personal Meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medlock|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held as part of the eighth Biennial International Meaning Conference convened by the International Network on Personal Meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First Congress on the Construction of Personal Meaning: Exploring What Makes Life Worth Living |url=http://meaning.ca/conference/past-conferences/meaning-conference-2014/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407195317/http://meaning.ca/conference/past-conferences/meaning-conference-2014/ |website=meaning.ca |archivedate=2016-04-07 |accessdate=2016-04-07 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning as meaning-making==
The term ''meaning-making'' has been used in constructivist [[educational psychology]] to refer to the personal [[epistemology]] that people create to help them to make sense of the influences, relationships and sources of knowledge in their world.&lt;ref name="edu-refs"/&gt;

For example, psychologist [[Robert Kegan]] developed a theoretical framework that posited [[Robert Kegan#The Evolving Self|five levels of meaning-making]]; each level describes a more advanced way of understanding experiences, and people may come to master each level as they develop psychologically.&lt;ref name="Kegan"/&gt; Similarly, according to the [[transformative learning]] theory of sociologist and educator [[Jack Mezirow]], adults interpret the meaning of their experiences through a lens of deeply held assumptions.&lt;ref name="Mezirow"&gt;{{harvnb|Mezirow|2009}}; {{harvnb|Park|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they experience something that contradicts or challenges their way of negotiating the world they have to go through the transformative process of evaluating their assumptions and processes of making meaning. Experiences that force individuals to engage in this critical self-reflection, or what Mezirow called "disorienting dilemmas",&lt;ref name="Mezirow"/&gt; can be events such as loss, trauma, stressful life transitions or other interruptions.

==In bereavement==
With the experience of a [[death]], people often have to create new meaning of their loss. Interventions that promote meaning-making may be beneficial to grievers, as some interventions have been found to improve both [[mental health]] and physical health.&lt;ref name="Mackay"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|Bluck|2010|p=720}}: "In their study of bereaved parents, Murphy et al. (2003) showed that finding meaning was related to lower mental distress, higher marital satisfaction, and better physical health. Similar links to better adjustment have been found in other samples of bereaved parents (Keesee et al., 2008) and adults who lost loved ones through violent means (i.e., accidents, homicide, and suicide; Currier, Holland, &amp; Neimeyer, 2006)."&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some researchers, "for certain individuals from challenging backgrounds, efforts after meaning might not be psychologically healthy" when those efforts are "more similar to rumination than to resolution" of problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sales|Merrill|Fivush|2013|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers report that meaning-making can help people feel less distressed, and allows people to become more resilient in the face of loss.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{harvnb|Calhoun|Tedeschi|2006}}; {{harvnb|Davis|Harasymchuk|Wohl|2012}}; {{harvnb|Webster|Deng|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the converse, failing to attribute meaning to death leads to more long-term distress for some people.&lt;ref name="Davis 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|Nolen-Hoeksema|Larson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various strategies people can utilize for meaning-making; many of them are summarized in the book ''Techniques of Grief Therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study developed a "Meaning of Loss Codebook" which clusters common meaning-making strategies into 30 categories.&lt;ref name="Gillies"&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these meaning-making strategies, the most frequently used categories include: personal growth, family bonds, spirituality, valuing life, negative affect, impermanence, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes, [[compassion]], and release from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|pp=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family bonds===
Individuals using existing [[Human bonding|family bonds]] for meaning-making have a "change in outlook and/or behavior towards family members".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gillies|Neimeyer|Milman|2014|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this meaning-making strategy, individuals create meaning of loss through their interactions with family members, and make more efforts to spend more time with them.&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt; When individuals use family to give meaning to loss, more meaning-making strategies emerge within the family system. A couple of strategies that family members use to help each other [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] are discussing the legacy of the deceased, and talking to non-family members about the loss.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{harvnb|Black|Santanello|Rubinstein|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When family members are able to openly express their attitudes and [[belief]]s, it can lead to a better well-being and less disagreement in the family.&lt;ref name="Davis 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|Harasymchuk|Wohl|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning-making with one's family also increases marital satisfaction by reducing family tension, especially if the deceased was another family member.&lt;ref name="Mackay"/&gt;

===Spirituality and religiosity===
Meaning-making through [[spirituality]] and [[religiosity]] is significant because it helps individuals cope with their loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Way"&gt;{{harvnb|Way|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality and religiosity helps grievers think about a transcendental reality, share their worldview, and feel a sense of belonging to communities with shared beliefs.

When individuals with a [[divinity]] worldview make meaning through spirituality and religiosity, those "individuals perceive the divine to be involved in a major stressful life event" and use the divine to develop a meaning for the loss.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Abraham|Bonar|McAuliffe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main ways in which a [[theistic]] individual may create meaning through religion: benevolent religious reappraisals, punishing God reappraisals, and reappraisals of God's power.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Benevolent religious reappraisals cast God in a positive light and grievers may see the death as a part of God's plan. Punishing God reappraisals cast God in a dark light and grievers may blame God for the loss or feel punished by God. Reappraisals of God's power questions God's ability to intervene on the situation.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; All of these appraisals contribute to how the griever may create meaning of their loss.

Another meaning-making strategy people use is to create meaning by valuing their own life. People who create meaning in this way may try to cherish the life they have, try to find their purpose, or change their lifestyles.&lt;ref name="Gillies"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Grievers can make meaning of death through philanthropic services such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through [[philanthropy]] can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"&gt;{{harvnb|Rossetto|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed "Nora's Project" after their daughter with a disability died, in order to help provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt; The mother said: "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world".&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt; Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.&lt;ref name="Rossetto"/&gt;

[[File:Dirck Hals - Merry Company at Table - WGA11040.jpg|thumb|[[Dirck Hals]], ''Merry Company at Table'', 1627–29]]

'''Merry company''' is the term in [[art history]] for a painting, usually from the 17th century, showing a small group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making.  These scenes are a very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]]; it is estimated that nearly two thirds of Dutch genre scenes show people drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, II, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is the usual translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''geselschapje'',&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; or ''vrolijk gezelschap'', and is capitalized when used as a title for a work, and sometimes as a term for the type. The scenes may be set in the home, a garden, or a tavern, and the gatherings range from decorous groups in wealthy interiors to groups of drunk men with prostitutes.  Gatherings that are relatively decorous and expensively dressed, with similar numbers of men and women, often standing, may be called ''Elegant Company'' or ''Gallant Company'', while those showing people who are clearly [[peasant]]s are more likely to use that word in their title.  Such subjects in painting are most common in Dutch art between about 1620 and 1670.

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Honthorst, Gerard van - Merry Company - 1623.jpg|thumb|right|Prostitution is clearly indicated in this scene by [[Gerard van Honthorst]] of 1623, complete with aged procuress, low cleavage, and a feathered headdress on the second girl.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Franits, 78–82&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
[[File:A merry company in a taverne Abraham II van den Hecke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abraham van den Hecken]], ''A Merry Company in a Tavern'', 1640s]]

The definition of a "merry company" is far from rigid, and overlaps with several other types of painting. Portraits of family groups or bodies such as militia companies may borrow an informal style of composition from them, but works where the figures were intended to represent specific individuals are excluded.  There are normally between four and about a dozen figures shown, which typically includes both men and women, but may just consist of men, perhaps with female servants, as in the Buytewech illustrated. Contemporary Dutch descriptions of paintings from inventories, auction catalogues and the like, use (no doubt somewhat arbitrarily) other terms for similar compositions including "a ''buitenpartij'' (an outdoor party or picnic), a ''cortegaarddje'' (a barrack-room or '''guardroom scene'''), a ''borddeeltjen'' (a bordello scene), and a ''beeldeken'' or ''moderne beelden'' (a picture with little figures or modern figures)".&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Musical party" or "concert" is often used when some of the main figures are playing instruments.  More generally such works may be referred to as "company paintings" or  "company subjects" (but this is not to be confused with Indian [[Company painting]], a style patronized by the [[British East India Company]]).  Few if any titles used for 17th century genre paintings can be traced to the artist; those used by museums and art historians today may derive from a record in the [[provenance]] or be made up in modern times.

Paintings showing specific celebrations such as weddings or the festivities for [[Twelfth Night]], the main mid-winter celebration in the Netherlands, or the playing of specific games, are likely to have titles relating to these where the subject is still clear.  For example, a painting by [[Godfried Schalcken]] (1665–1670, [[Royal Collection]]) is known from his biography by his pupil [[Arnold Houbraken]] to represent ''The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden''', and is so titled, although the rules of this are now unknown but "clearly involved the removal of clothes", at least by some male participants.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 147; [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12516&amp;object=405343&amp;row=1 "The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden'"], Royal Collection online&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''La Main Chaud'' ("the hot hand") male participants just got smacked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/follower-of-hieronymus-janssens-ladies-and-gentlemen-playing-la-main-chaude ''Ladies and Gentlemen playing La Main Chaude''], National Gallery, London. The game is shown in other paintings, including two by [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] with peasants. In the variant described at Schama, 439, it is the "rump" that gets smacked.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paintings showing the [[parable of the Prodigal Son]] in his prodigal phase are conceived as merry company scenes of the brothel type, though they are often larger, as was expected of a [[history painting]].

==Interpretation==
As with other types of Netherlandish genre painting, the body of merry company paintings include some with a clear moralistic intention, carrying a message to avoid excess in drink, lavish spending, low company and fornication.  Others seem merely to celebrate the pleasures of sociability, often with a socially aspirational element.  Many fall somewhere in between, are hard to interpret, and "contain within them an obvious contradiction between their goal of condemning certain types of excessive behaviour and the amusing and attractive aspect of this very behaviour and its representation".&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Vergara, "The Subject Matter of Paintings of Domestic Interiors" in ''Vermeer and the Dutch Interior'', 2003, (orig. ''Vermeer y El Interior Holandes''), excerpted at [http://www.essentialvermeer.com/dutch-painters/dutch_art/subject_matter.html www.essentialvermeer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the art historian wishing to interpret them has first to decide such questions as whether the scene is placed in a home, a tavern or a brothel, and if a tavern whether the women present are respectable or prostitutes, or whether the artist had a intention to convey definite meaning to his contemporary viewers on these questions at all.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 68–69, 78–82, 106–107, 124, 201; van de Pol; Schama, 462–464; Webster&lt;/ref&gt;  The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Mira, "On Diderot's Art Criticism", [http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf p. 123] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes with prostitutes do not reflect the realities of 17th century prostitution in many ways, but offer a conventionalized visual code.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 466–480; van de Pol; Franits, 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;  The madam or (as art historians like to call them) "procuress" is always an aged crone, whereas court records for [[Amsterdam]] (the national centre for Dutch prostitution) show that most were still fairly young, and 40% in their twenties.&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol, 40% is Amsterdam 1650–99; Schama, 477&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of a procuress figure is by itself sufficient to justify interpreting a painting as a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 20, 177&lt;/ref&gt; Fine clothes (rented from the madam) and in particular feathers in headresses are said to be signifiers of prostitutes,&lt;ref&gt;van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the more obvious loosened clothes, low cleavages, and a provocative frontal stance. But in the later part of the century demure downcast looks by the woman feature in many scenes thought to represent prostitution;&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 106–107, 124, 201&lt;/ref&gt; in the famously ambiguous threesome ''[[The Gallant Conversation]]'' by [[Gerard ter Borch]], the young woman is seen only from behind.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;  Of one painting by [[Jacob Ochtervelt]], (c. 1670, now Cleveland, illustrated at left) Wayne Franits says: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first glance, the ''Musical Company in an Interior'' appears to be an elegant gathering of well-heeled youths [and women and a servant]... The picture exudes an aura of calmness and finesse.  Nevertheless, the series of female portraits on the wall behind the figures discloses the true nature of its subject.  There is strong evidence that actual brothels displayed portraits like these to assist clients in selecting their partners.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 201; the pictures are high on the back wall and not easy to make out in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Simon de Vos - Merrymakers in an Inn - Walters 371741.jpg|thumb|[[Simon de Vos]], 1630s; according to the owning museum "Well-bred young ladies did not join parties in public inns; these smiling women are prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/23727 ''Merrymakers at an Inn''], [[Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to [[Simon Schama]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when we are unsure whether we are looking at a picture of a home or a tavern, or whether what seems to be a tavern is actually a brothel, it may not be because we lack hard-and-fast clues to the artist's unambiguous intention, but because he meant us to be unsure. ... It would be futile to attempt to distinguish between scenes of good homely fun and public-house dissipation, because the figurative and actual territories were themselves deliberately mixed up. Where goings-on take place in a household or, conversely, children run around with gleeful worldliness in a tavern, there is a good chance that the picture is about the conmingling of innocence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 462–463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jan Steen]] owned a tavern for a period, living on the premises, and often included portraits of himself and members of his family in "genre" works.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 463; Slive, 169-171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], who painted several scenes that, like the one illustrated here, clearly do show prostitution, married the daughter of the proprietress of a tavern and a wine merchant, who was a distant cousin and something of an heiress.  The traditional interpretation and title of his ''Prodigal Son'' in [[Munich]] has been challenged, with the assertion that it merely shows a "festive" tavern scene, despite the presence of an older woman and feathers in the girls' hair, often taken as diagnostic of a brothel scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, I, 328–329; [[:File:Gerard van Honthorst 004.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Duck-scène-galante.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob Duck]], 1635-40]]
[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - The Prodigal Son - WGA11660.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] ''Prodigal Son''.]]

Elmer Kolfin, in "the first comprehensive study to date on the merry company in Dutch art during the first half of the seventeenth century" divides the pictures "into three iconographic categories: "idealistic", which present mainly positive views of the festive activities depicted; "moralistic", in which such activities are condemned from a moral point of view; and "satirical", in which they are held up for ridicule, but chiefly for comic rather than moralizing effect" seeing a movement away from moralistic to idealistic treatments from the 16th to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt, reviewing Kolfin&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars see a large group of paintings as deliberately ambiguous or open in their meaning; the limited evidence we have suggests they were often displayed in the main rooms of their owners' houses.&lt;ref&gt;Nevitt; Webster; Schama, 461–464&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptional freedom allowed to Dutch women amazed and usually horrified foreign visitors; according to the visiting Englishman [[Fynes Moryson]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... mothers of good fame permit their daughters at home after they themselves go to bed, to sit up with young men all or most part of the night, banqueting and talking, yea with leave and without leave to walk abroad with young men in the streets by night.  And this they do out of a customed liberty without prejudice to their fame whereas the Italian women, strictly kept, think it folly to omit every opportunity they can get to do ill".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Schama, 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many paintings have lightly worn allegorical schemes; a plate of food, tobacco pipe, musical instrument and a squeeze, kiss or slap will be enough to make any group into an ''Allegory of the Five Senses''.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 27, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Many may illustrate the endless supply of moralistic Dutch proverbs.

==Development of the type==
[[File:Jan van Hemessen - The Prodigal Son - WGA11358.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jan van Hemessen]], ''The Prodigal Son'', 1536]]

Courtly party scenes, typically of couples of young lovers in a "garden of love", were popular in the late Middle Ages, mostly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[old master print|prints]] rather than [[panel painting]]s, and often as part of calendar series showing the months, or book illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb "Merry Company"], Istvan Nemeth, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, for Google Cultural Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Renaissance such scenes tended to be given specific settings from religion or classical mythology, such as the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'' which, unlike merry company scenes, was an excuse for copious amounts of nudity.  In 16th century [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]] traditions of genre painting of festivities or parties began to develop, most famously in the peasant scenes of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], which were the first large paintings to have peasant life as their sole subject. 

There was also a tradition of moralizing urban scenes, including subjects such as the "Ill-matched Couple" and "Prodigal Son",&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 68–69, 72–75; van de Pol&lt;/ref&gt; and a court tradition of recording actual or typical entertainments at a particular court, with portraits of the leading personages.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 151, and more generally the "Festival book" and related traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist]]'' by the German-[[Silesia]]n artist [[Bartholomeus Strobel]] (c. 1630-43, [[Prado]]) is an exceptionally large treatment of a subject often used since the 15th century to depict a courtly banquet. ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]'' by [[Paolo Veronese]] (1573, [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], [[Venice]]) is another famous and huge treatment of a grand feast.

The "courtly company scene" with anonymous genre figures developed in the first years of the 17th century in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands, now separated by the [[Eighty Years War]].  As the subject type developed, so did differences between the two regions: Flemish painting covered a wider range of settings in terms of class, with peasant scenes remaining strongly represented, and many scenes showing court milieus.  Dutch painting concentrated on a class spectrum that might all be called middle-class, though ranging from elegant patrician companies to scruffy and rowdy groups.  Flemish scenes tend to have far more characters, and the tranquil middle class group of four or five people sitting round a table at home is not seen.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most Dutch paintings, except for those by the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], had small figures, the "monumental company scene" remained part of Flemish painting, with [[Jacob Jordaens]] producing several examples, especially of Twelfth Night festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 166–171&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1630s artists in both regions, but especially the north, tended to specialize in particular genres, and the merry company was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 7-8; Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painters==
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - Inn with drunken peasants.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen Brouwer]], ''Inn with Drunken Peasants'', 1620s]]

The first generation of Dutch painters included [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]] (1591/1592–1624), who can claim to have invented the small interior merry company,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–126; [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/merry-company/hgHsn_TInoCy4g?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en-gb Google art project, Budapest example]&lt;/ref&gt; Other early artists were [[David Vinckboons]] (1576–1629),&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 124–125; Franits, 53–57&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630), who was an even more significant pioneer of realistic [[landscape painting]], in a completely different style to his elegant garden parties.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125; 180–183&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous portraitist [[Frans Hals]] was attributed with a single very early merry company, a gallant picnic of about 1610, which was destroyed in [[Berlin]] in World War II;&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; he also painted a "close-up" genre depiction of three revellers.&lt;ref&gt;Liedke, 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother [[Dirck Hals]] (1591–1656) was a prolific specialist in small merry company groups.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 1630 active painters included [[Hendrik Gerritsz. Pot]] (1587–1657), also a portraitist, [[Anthonie Palamedesz.]] (1601–1673), [[Pieter Codde]] (1599–1678), and [[Jacob Duck]] (1600–1667). Codde and Duck, with [[Willem Duyster]], were also painters of "guardroom scenes", which showed soldiers specifically, and became popular in the 1630s; as Lucy van de Pol notes, the sailors who made up a great part of the clientele of taverns and brothels, at least in Amsterdam, are very rarely represented.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 126, 131–133; van de Pol; Franits, 57–64; Rosen covers the guardroom scene very fully&lt;/ref&gt;  

After about the mid-century many "company paintings" showed smaller and more quiet groups more firmly located in homes, often with more narrative elements and a greater concentration on effects of lighting and texture.  Pictures showing many of the same interests as "company" works, but just using couples or individuals become very common.  The paintings of [[Vermeer]], none of which quite fall into the category of "merry company" works, exemplify this trend, which is also seen in those of [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Gerrit Dou]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]].&lt;ref&gt;See Franits and Slive on these artists, via indices&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of [[Jan Steen]] (c. 1626–1679) maintained the tradition of rowdy drinking groups, but usually with a setting showing a specific occasion, or illustrating a proverb. Many show family groups, and often a self-portrait is included.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 169–176; Franits, 203–214&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:El Jardín del Amor (Rubens) (alta resolución).jpg|thumb|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', 1630–35, the apotheosis of the outdoor courtly company]]

Flemish artists include [[David Vinckboons]], who moved to the north as a young adult, [[Frans Francken II]] with [[Hieronymus Francken I|his uncle Hieronymus I]] and [[Hieronymus Francken II|brother Hieronymus II]], [[Sebastian Vrancx]], [[Louis de Caullery]], all painting courtly scenes, often with small figures and much attention given to the architectural settings in or outside sumptuous palaces. [[Simon de Vos]] (1603–1676), painted smaller scenes closer to the Dutch style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruegel tradition of peasant scenes was continued by his sons [[Jan Brueghel I]] and [[Peter Brueghel the Younger]], mostly painting ''[[Kermesse (festival)|kermesse]]''-type festivities with large numbers of figures, most often outdoors.  Smaller groups in interiors were pioneered by the intensely naturalistic [[Adriaen Brouwer]], who was Flemish but also worked and sold in [[Haarlem]] in the north, where he greatly influenced [[Adriaen van Ostade]], the leading Dutch painter of peasants.  Brouwer's sordid scenes are short on merriment, but van Ostade softened and sentimentalized his style.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 149–150, 154–159, 162; Slive, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Teniers the Elder]], his son [[David Teniers the Younger]] as well as other members of the family included many peasant scenes in their large and varied output.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 160–162&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the works of all these painters lie outside the typical boundaries of the "merry company", in terms of the number of figures or their class, but many fall within; there was also a later generation of Flemish painters of peasant scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 162–166&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]], who owned 17 paintings by Adriaen Brouwer, painted a few ''kermesse'' and other peasant scenes that are highly successful, despite their very heroic style.  He also painted a few large courtly company scenes, including his ''[[The Garden of Love (Rubens)|Garden of Love]]'', ([[Prado]], 1634-5).&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 152, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Jordaens and Rubens, Flemish painters of monumental company scenes included [[Theodoor Rombouts]] (1597–1637), who made several large paintings of card-players, [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Jan Cossiers]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 167–171&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''microapartment''', also known as a '''microflat''', is a one-room, self-contained living space, usually purpose built, designed to accommodate a sitting space, sleeping space, bathroom and [[kitchenette]] with 14–32 square metres (50–350 sq ft) Unlike a traditional [[studio flat]], residents may also have access to a communal kitchen, communal bathroom/shower, [[patio]] and [[roof garden]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Small_room_-_interior.JPG|thumb|250px|Bedrooms in microapartments need to be tiny and may also serve as a living room.]]
The microapartments are often designed for [[futons]], or with [[Murphy bed|pull-down beds]], folding desks and tables, and extra-small or hidden appliances. They differ from [[bedsit]]s, the traditional British bed-sitting room, in that they are self-contained, with their own bathroom, toilet, and kitchenette.

Microapartments are becoming popular in urban centres in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and North America, maximizing profits for developers and landlords and providing relatively low-priced accommodation.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite news |first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/21/real_estate/micro-apartments/index.html |title=Micro-apartments: The anti-McMansions |work=CNN Money |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/11/san-francisco-approves-220-square-foot-micro-apartments.html |title=Would you live in a 220-square-foot 'micro apartment?' |work=CBC News |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rome]], where the average price of property in 2010 was $7,800 per square metre (10.7 square feet), microapartments as small as 4 square metres (45 square feet) have been advertised.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Day |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/tight-fit-for-romes-microapartments-7447396.html |title=Tight fit for Rome's 'micro-apartments' |work=The Independent |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
[[Gary Chang (architect)|Gary Chang]], an architect in [[Hong Kong]], has designed a large 32-square-metre (344 sq ft) microapartment with sliding walls attached to tracks on the ceiling. By moving the walls around, and using built-in folding furniture and worktops, he can convert the space into 24 different rooms, including a kitchen, library, laundry room, dining room, bar and video-game room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Virginia |last=Gardiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html |title=24 Rooms Tucked Into One |work=The New York Times |date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, developers are embracing the micro-living trend, renting microapartments at sky-high prices. The ''Wall Street Journal'' compares the 180-square-feet flat in High Place, [[Sai Ying Pun]] to the size of a U.S. parking spot (160 square feet) in a video, highlighting the soaring property prices in Hong Kong (one of the apartments in High Place was sold for more than US$500,000 in June 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=2 June 2015 |title=In Hong Kong, the Apartments Are Fit for a Mosquito |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York City |access-date=21 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston's first microapartment building opened in August 2016, at 1047 Commonwealth Avenue in [[Packard's Corner]].  As the largest microapartment building in the United States, the building is currently being leased by Boston University to house 341 students during the renovation of another university residence.  The building contains 180 units that each contain a bathroom with stand-up shower; a kitchen with all stainless-steel appliances that include an oven, a microwave, a dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Each unit also includes a stand up washer-dryer unit. Other amenities include an optional parking garage and indoor bike room in the basement, currently unused retail space, a lounge space, a rooftop penthouse, a deck overlooking the [[Allston]] neighbors, and an entertainment room that will be converted to a fitness center at the end of the University's tenure at the property, which is anticipated to be in 2018.

In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit. &lt;ref name=Bring_back_boarding_house&gt;{{cite news | last=Badger | first=Emily | title=Is It Time to Bring Back the Boarding House? | url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | access-date=2017-11-13 | publisher=CityLab - The Atlantic Monthly Group | date=2013-07-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114022002/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | archive-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a backlash in some cities against the increasing number of microapartments. In [[Seattle]], some residents have complained that [[Urban density|high-density]] microhousing changes the character of neighbourhoods, suddenly increasing demand for parking spaces and other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hickman |first=Matt |url=http://www.mnn.com/your-home/remodeling-design/blogs/micro-apartments-met-with-nimbyist-sentiment-in-seattle |title=Micro-apartments met with NIMBYist sentiment in Seattle |work=Mother Nature Network |date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Thompson |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020845443_apodmentscitycouncilxml.html  |title=Critics of micro-apartments calling for a moratorium |work=Seattle Times |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, property developers are using office-to-residential permitted development rights, a policy introduced in 2013, to transform old office buildings into microapartment developments. The nationally described space standard stipulates that new homes in the UK cannot be smaller than 37sqm; however, this does not apply to conversions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Jones |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |date=11 February 2017 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based developer Inspired Homes has taken advantage of office-to-residential permitted development rights to deliver over 400 microapartments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Gordon |url=https://www.metro.news/the-micro-apartment-may-be-a-trend-thats-here-to-stay/558705/ |title=The micro apartment may be a trend that’s here to stay |date=4 April 2017 |work=Metro News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-property in the UK has no strict definition but typically refers to properties with a floor area below 37sqm. ''Which?'' magazine reported that almost 8,000 new micro-homes were built in 2016, the highest number on record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/08/the-30-sqm-squeeze-would-you-buy-a-micro-home/ |title=The 30 sqm squeeze: would you buy a ‘micro-home’? |date=19 August 2017 |last=Calver |first=Tom |work=[[Which?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, the largest microapartment building in the world is The Collective Old Oak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mairs |first1=Jessica |title=World's largest co-living complex promises residents "everything at their fingertips" |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/28/collective-old-oak-common-co-living-plp-architecture-willesden-junction-london-housing/ |website=Dezeen |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in London on May 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside London’s Largest Co-Living Development |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-londons-largest-co-living-development-1478794347 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[PLP Architecture]], the development has 546 rooms with most units grouped into "twodios" – two en-suite bedrooms that share a small kitchenette. There are also some private suites. The units sizes range from {{convert|9.2|sqm}} for an ensuite rooms with a {{convert|5.8|sqm}} shared kitchenette, to {{convert|12|sqm}} for a shared ensuite and {{convert|16.5|sqm}} shared ensuite with kitchenette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Co-Living FAQ|url=https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving/faq|website=The Collective|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each floor features one larger kitchen with a dining table, which is shared between 30 and 70 residents, and themed communal living spaces such as a games room, a cinema, a 'disco-launderette', a hidden garden and a spa. A restaurant, gym and co-working spaces are located in the lower floors of the building.

===Germany===
In 2017, the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' reported there are about 25,000 micro-apartments in the country, and several thousand more are set to be built by the end of 2018. The projects will receive state support: the federal government plans to invest €120M in the micro-apartment market expansion. The market of micro-apartment targets over 30 million people, including students, singles and tenants whose primary places of residence are far from the big cities they work in. In Germany, tenants traditionally face considerable obstacles when trying to rent for anything less than the long-term — such as the obligation to pay a security deposit equal to three months’ rent and heightened credit history scrutiny. To the contrary, micro-apartments tend to cater to short- to medium-term renters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro-apartments:the hottest new trend sweeping the German real estate market|url=https://tranio.com/germany/analytics/micro-apartments-the-hottest-new-trend-sweeping-the-german-real-estate-market_5245/|website=Tranio|date=21 December 2016 |first1=Elena |last1=Milishenkova |first2=George |last2=Kachmazov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
Although some prefer to live in microapartments, others only temporarily live in microapartments due to economic reasons, and would move to a larger house or apartment if they could afford to do so.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Susan Saegert, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center was quoted with her opinion on microapartments, “I’ve studied children in crowded apartments and low-income housing a lot,” Saegert said, “and they can end up becoming withdrawn, and have trouble studying and concentrating.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-health-risks-of-small-apartments/282150/ |title=The Health Risks of Small Apartments |first=Jacoba |last=Urist |date=19 December 2013 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size of a microapartment can be an issue, as its confined nature may permit strong odors to linger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tempest |first=Jean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/realestate/what-no-one-ever-tells-you-about-tiny-homes.html |title=What no one ever tells you about tiny homes |work=New York Times |date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Munda people''' ([[Hindi]]: मुंडा,  [[Assamese language|Assamese]]: মুণ্ডা, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: মুন্ডা) are an [[Adivasi]] ethnic group of [[India]]. They speak the [[Mundari language]], which belongs to the [[Munda languages|Munda subgroup]] of [[Austroasiatic languages]]. The Munda are found in the northern areas of east India concentrated in the states of [[Jharkhand]], [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]]. Munda also reside in adjacent areas of [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] as well as in portions of [[Bangladesh]]. The group is one of India's largest [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled tribes]].
Munda people in [[Tripura]] are also known as Mura, and in [[Madhya Pradesh]] they are often called Mudas.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribesindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=792&amp;Itemid=104&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old Munda Men, Dinajpur, 2010 by Biplob Rahman.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Elderly Munda men]]

==History==

The prehistory of the Munda peoples is obscure. Although how they got to the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] is disputed, it is agreed upon that the ancestors of speakers of the modern-day [[Munda languages]] migrated westward from the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] homeland of continental [[Southeast Asia]].

According to [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.S. Sharma]], a historian of ancient and early medieval India, many Munda, Dravidian and non-Sanskrit terms occur in Vedic texts ascribed to 1500-500 BCE. They indicate ideas, institutions, products and settlements associated with peninsular and non-Vedic India. Similarly, many [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] terms, signifying ideas and institutions developed in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], appear in the earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] texts called the [[Sangam literature]], which was created from 300 BCE to 600 CE. The eastern region, inhabited by the [[Munda peoples|Munda]], people made its own contribution. Several terms that signify the use of cotton, navigation, digging, sticks, etc. in the Indo-Aryan languages have been traced back to the [[Munda languages]]. It is held that changes in the phonetics and vocabulary of the Vedic language can be explained by contact with both [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=India's Ancient Past|last=Sharma|first=R.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199087860|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800's, the [[British Raj]] and many non-Mundas were grabbing land traditionally occupied by Mundas, forcing the Mundas to work as bonded labourers. Munda freedom fighter [[Birsa Munda]] began the first protest marches calling for remission of forest dues. He worked to unify the [[Adivasi]]s of [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur]] resist British rule of India. [[Millenarianism]] in the [[India tribal belt|tribal belt]] started with him, and he is still revered in [[Jharkhand]], with villagers in his home village worshipping him as Birsa Bhagawan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jharkhand-amit-shah-launches-scheme-for-villages-of-freedom-fighters-khunti-4848635/|title=Jharkhand: Amit Shah launches scheme for villages of freedom fighters|last=Pandey|first=Prashant|date=2017-09-18|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture &amp; tradition== 
The Munda people probably descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Riccio et al. (2011), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21740156 ''The Austroasiatic Munda population from India and Its enigmatic origin: a HLA diversity study''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nomadic hunters in the [[India tribal belt]], they became farmers who were employed in basketwork and weaving. With the listing of the Munda people as Scheduled Tribes (Adivasis), many are employed in various governmental organizations (particularly [[Indian Railways]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Schedule Castes |publisher=Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India |year=2011 |url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/aboutdivision1.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923060507/http://socialjustice.nic.in/aboutdivision1.php |archivedate=23 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Encyclopedia mundarica (John-Baptist Hoffmann).JPG|thumb|alt=Eight books on a shelf|upright=1.2|Part of [[John-Baptist Hoffmann]]'s 15-volume ''Encyclopaedia Mundarica'']]
Munda religion is a blend of [[Sarnaism]] and Christianity, and they are not part of the [[Indian caste system]]. Although the Mundas have preserved much of their pre-Christian culture, they have absorbed a number of Christian traditions. They have many [[folk songs]], [[dance]]s, [[Narrative|tales]] and traditional [[musical instruments]]. Both sexes participate in dances at social events and festivals. The [[naqareh]] is a principal musical instrument.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Munda people have elaborate rituals to celebrate birth, death, engagement and marriage. The birth of a boy is celebrated as an earner for the family, and the birth of a girl is celebrated as a family caretaker. ''Lota-pani'' is the engagement ceremony. ''Dali Takka'', a monetary gift to paternal guardians, is generally paid before the marriage. Marriage, considered one of the main rituals of life, is a week-long festivity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

An ointment of scented oil and turmeric is applied to the face and body after death. Widow marriage is common. The Munda people are patrilineal, [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] and patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weK7KuCvNiQC|title=Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: In 36 Volumes. Jharkhand|last=Bhatt|first=Shankarlal C.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178353685|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involved in agriculture, the Munda people celebrate the seasonal festivals of [[Mage Parab]], Phagu, [[Karam (festival)]], [[Baha parab]], [[Sarhul]] and [[Sohrai]]. Some seasonal festivals have coincided with religious festivals, but their original meaning remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoindia.com/tribes/munda.html|title=Mundas, Munda Tribe in Jharkhand India, Occupation of Mundas|website=www.ecoindia.com|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munda people of Jharkhand  also follow the old age tradition of Patthalgari i.e. stone erection in which the tribal community residing in the village buries a large inverted u shaped dressed headstone on the head side of grave or entrance of village in which is inscribed the family tree of the dead persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/20515/11/11_chapter%205.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are some other types of patthalgari also:-
*[[Horadiri]] - It is the stone in which family tree is written.
*[[Chalpadiri]] or [[Saasandiri]] - It is the stone in remarking boundary of any village and its limits.
*[[Magodiri]] - This is the headstone of social criminal who committed polygamy or unsocial marriage.
*[[Ziddiri]] - This is the stone placed on over burial of placenta and dried naval part of a newborn. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/mendaly352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scroll.in/article/878468/the-constitution-set-in-stone-adivasis-in-jharkhand-are-using-an-old-tradition-as-a-novel-protest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and studies==
[[Jesuit]] priest John-Baptist Hoffmann (1857–1928) studied the language, customs, religion and life of the Munda people, publishing the first [[Mundari language]] grammar in 1903.  With the help of Menas Orea, Hoffmann published the 15-volume ''Encyclopaedia mundarica''. The first edition was published posthumously in 1937, and a third edition was published in 1976. ''The Mundas and Their Country'', by S. C. Roy, was published in 1912. ''Adidharam'' (Hindi:आदि धर्म) by Ram Dayal Munda and Ratan Singh Manki, in Mundari with a [[Hindi]] translation, describes Munda rituals and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribalstuffs.blogspot.in/2011/11/mundari-language-of-munda-tribe.html|title=Mundari: The Language of Munda Tribe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oragenitalism''''' is a book by the American folklorist [[Gershon Legman]], published by the Julian Press in 1969. The book describes various types of [[oral sex]]. 
The book is intended as "instruction manual, conduct guide, and household advice book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7OeNRe9V1K8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq= Kick 2006, p. 66a]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author claimed that it was the earliest book of its kind on the subject, and for a long time the only one.&lt;ref name=brottman31&gt;Brottman (2004) p.31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its contents are divided into four sections: "[[Cunnilingus|Cunnilinctus]]" written under the pen-name Roger-Maxe de la Glannege (an [[anagram]] of his real name) and published by Jacob Brussel of New York in 1940;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Martha Cornog |author2=Timothy Perper | title=Make love, not war: The legacy of Gershon Legman, 1917-1999 | doi=10.1080/00224499909552002 | journal=Journal of Sex Research | volume=36 | issue=3 |date=August 1999 | pages=316–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade (2001) p.802&lt;/ref&gt; the three remaining sections "[[Fellatio]]", "[[Irrumatio]]n", and "[[69 (sex position)|Sixty-Nine]]" were not published until 1969.&lt;ref name=brottman31/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7688">The '''patriarchal age''' is the era of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], according to the narratives of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12–50. (These chapters also contain the history of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]], although Joseph is not one of the patriarchs.) It is preceded in the Bible by the [[primeval history]] and followed by [[The Exodus]].

==Jewish tradition==
The Bible contains an intricate pattern of chronologies from the creation of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the first man, to the reigns of the later kings of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Based on this chronology and the Rabbinic tradition, ancient Jewish sources such as [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] date the birth of [[Abraham]] to 1948 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] (c. 1813 BCE)&lt;ref name="abraham_jvl"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/abraham.html Jewish Virtual Library: Abraham]&lt;/ref&gt; and place the death of [[Jacob]] in 2255 AM (c. 1506 BCE).

==Biblical criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
History known and dateable independently from the Bible first makes contact with the Scriptures during the era of the first Jewish kings. As such, the events before this period came to be disputed with the advent of [[biblical criticism]] in the 19th century. Little interest in questioning the [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] existed before then, but with the development of the [[documentary hypothesis]] – the theory that the [[Pentateuch]], including the [[Book of Genesis]], was composed not by [[Moses]] but by unknown authors living at various times between 950 and 450 BC.

==Early biblical archaeology==
Out of this heated debate between the various theories of [[biblical criticism]] and traditional, religious interpretations was born [[biblical archaeology]], a form of archaeology different from others in that it sought not to discover and interpret mute evidence, but to validate or invalidate the historicity of the patriarchs and the events surrounding their lives, as described within the Bible.

The most eminent of early biblical archaeologists was [[William F. Albright]], who believed that he had identified the patriarchal age in the period 2100–1800 BC, the Intermediate [[Bronze Age]], the interval between two periods of highly developed urban culture in ancient [[Canaan]]. Albright argued that he had found evidence of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|sudden collapse]] of the previous Early Bronze Age culture, and ascribed this to the invasion of migratory [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomads]] from the northeast whom he identified with the [[Amorites]] mentioned in Mesopotamian texts. According to Albright, Abraham was a wandering Amorite who migrated from the north into the central highlands of Canaan and the Negev with his flocks and followers as the Canaanite city-states collapsed. Albright, [[E. A. Speiser]] and [[Cyrus Gordon]] argued that although the texts described by the documentary hypothesis were written centuries after the patriarchal age, archaeology had shown that they were nevertheless an accurate reflection of the conditions of the 2nd millennium BC: "We can assert with full confidence that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were actual historical individuals."&lt;ref&gt;John Bright, "History of Israel", 1972, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblical archaeology==
Albright's interpretation came under fierce criticism as archaeology unearthed apparent [[anachronism]]s in the biblical accounts of the patriarchal age, in some cases suggesting that some of the texts were written later than the traditional dates. For example, in Genesis 21:32, Abraham apparently encounters [[Philistines]], who (according to archaeology{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}) actually did not settle in the Middle East until the 12th century BCE. However, usage of future place names had been a known Scriptural phenomenon to Jewish scholars for centuries prior to the biblical criticism movement.&lt;ref name="rashi_ber2"&gt;For instance, the classic tenth-century commentator [[Rashi]] notes that the Bible sometimes refers to places according to the names that later peoples created for them, as in his comment on Gen. 2:14: "Cush and Assyria: As yet they did not exist and Scripture wrote [using] their future names." Similarly in chapter 21, the Bible never actually calls Abimelech and his subjects "Philistines," but only says that they returned to "the land [that would become that] of the Philistines."&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] from 2014 discovered what may be the earliest domesticated [[camel]] bones found in Israel or even anywhere outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This has been described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news| last=Hasson |first=Nir |title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091 |accessdate=30 January 2014 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sapir-Hen |first=Lidar |author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley |journal=Tel Aviv |year=2013 |volume=40 |pages=277–285 |url= http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf |accessdate=16 February 2014 |doi= 10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albright himself saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;Heide, Martin. 2011 "The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible."

The '''Petroleum Conservation Research Association''' (PCRA) is an organization established in [[India]] in 1978, under the aegis of the [[ gurchandan singh Government's of India|Indian]] [[Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas]] that is engaged in promoting [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in various sectors of the economy. It helps the government in proposing policies and strategies aimed at reducing India's dependency on oil, in order to save money, reduce the environmental impact of oil use and also conserve [[fossil fuel]].

==Mandate==
India's demand for petroleum products is increasing at a rate of approximately 3-4% per annum. Some of this usage, the PCRA argues, is avoidable: it sponsored a project in Delhi which is demonstrated that fuel worth Rs. 994 cr per annum is being burnt at traffic signals due to idling of vehicles at red lights. Energy efficiency measures to reduce by 2% India's use of petroleum products, worth Rs. 4 [[Lakh]] [[Crore]]s per annum, could save the country's Rs. 8,000 Crores worth of imports.

The PCRA is mandated to promote popular awareness of the importance of energy conservation. It cites an international acceptance that energy efficiency measures, like turning off car engines at traffic signals and driving at speeds of 45–50&amp;nbsp;km/h, could help most countries to reduce their use of petroleum products by 20%. The PCRA promotes a nationwide mass media awareness campaign titled “Save Fuel Yaani Save Money”, broadcast on television, radio, and in newspapers. The campaign mascot, Yaani, is a piggy bank, representing saving. The PCRA took the campaign to the [[India International Trade Fair]] – 09, where the PCRA stall featured interactive games and quizzes to promote energy efficiency.

The PCRA aims to become a center of excellence for conservation of hydrocarbons &amp; environment protection for sustainable development on our inherent strength. Its mission is to reach efficient energy utilization and environment protection leading to Improvement in Quality of Life. Its objectives are:

1)To formulate strategies and promote measures for accelerating conservation of petroleum products leading to environment protection, energy security and sustainable development.

2)To create awareness among masses about the importance, benefits and methods of conserving petroleum products &amp; clean environment by enhancing information and capacity building.

3)To promote research, development and deployment efforts aimed at petroleum conservation &amp; environment protection, support &amp; facilitate efforts for adoption and dissemination of fuel efficient technologies and substitution of petroleum products with alternate fuels and renewable.

4)To establish synergistic institutional linkages at the national &amp; international levels in the areas of petroleum conservation &amp; environment protection.

5)To provide training and technical advisory services, designed to achieve economy &amp; efficiency in use of petroleum products for cleaner environment.

6)To function as a Think Tank to the Govt. of India for proposing policies and strategies on petroleum conservation and environment protection aimed at reducing excessive dependence on oil

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'', 1874, by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], portrayed by [[Jane Morris]]]]
The '''Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ''' (later known as the '''Pre-Raphaelites''') was a group of [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]]s, [[poets]], and [[art critic]]s, founded in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The three founders were joined by [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[James Collinson]], [[Frederic George Stephens]] and [[Thomas Woolner]] to form the seven-member "brotherhood". Their principles were shared by other artists, including [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[Marie Spartali Stillman]].

A later, medievalising strain inspired by Rossetti included [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and extended into the twentieth century with artists such as [[John William Waterhouse]].

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what it considered the mechanistic approach first adopted by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Its members believed the [[Classicism|Classical]] poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the [[academic art|academic]] teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". In particular, the group objected to the influence of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], founder of the English [[Royal Academy of Arts]], whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Timothy (1970).  ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 46.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brotherhood sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian art. The group associated their work with [[John Ruskin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landow|first1=George P.|title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

The group continued to accept the concepts of [[history painting]] and [[mimesis]], imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the ''Pre-Raphaelite Journal''.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Germ.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Holman Hunt of Thomas Woolner's poem "My Beautiful Lady", published in ''The Germ'', 1850]]
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais's parents' house on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[William Holman Hunt]] were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of [[Ford Madox Brown]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=McGann&gt;McGann, Jerome J. ''The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', NINES consortium, Creative Commons License; http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s40.rap.html retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in [[Cleveland Street, London|Cleveland Street]], [[Fitzrovia]], Central London. Hunt had started painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'' based on [[The Eve of St. Agnes|Keats's poem of the same name]], but it was not completed until 1867.&lt;ref name=hilton28&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters [[James Collinson]] and [[Frederic George Stephens]], Rossetti's brother, poet and critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and  sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood.&lt;ref name=hilton28/&gt; Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to ''The Germ''. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including [[Charles Allston Collins]], and [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hisour.com/art-movements/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-1848-1855/|title=Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1848 - 1855 - HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|date=2017-02-22|work=HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood's early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading&lt;!-- "parading" NOT "parodying" --&gt; and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Latham, pp. 11-12; see also his comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by [[medieval]] culture, believing it to possess a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]]. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their [[idealism]] to the [[materialism|materialist]] realism associated with [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Impressionism]].

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of [[bitumen]] by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] and [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]]. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites&lt;/ref&gt;

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais's ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Isabella]]'' (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt's ''[[Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions|Rienzi]]'' (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy.  Rossetti's ''[[:File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 004.jpg|Girlhood of Mary Virgin]]'' was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials "PRB". Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, ''The Germ'' edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as [[Coventry Patmore]]. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'', by John Everett Millais, 1850]]
In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais' painting ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] by many reviewers, notably [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens'', p. 309. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens considered Millais' Mary to be ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Sophia (2005). ''The Pre-Raphaelite Art of the Victorian Novel: Narrative Challenges to Visual Gendered Boundaries'', p. 9. Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood's  medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 3 May 1851; pg. 8; Issue 20792: Exhibition of the Royal Academy. (Private View.), First Notice: ''"We cannot censure at present, as amply or as strongly as we desire to do, that strange disorder of the mind or the eyes which continues to rage with unabated absurdity among a class of juvenile artists who style themselves "P.R.B.," which being interpreted means ''Pre-Raphael Brethren''. Their faith seems to consist in an absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade, an aversion to beauty in every shape, and a singular devotion to the minute accidents of their subjects, including, or rather seeking out, every excess of sharpness and deformity."''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd "medieval" poses. A rival group of older artists, [[The Clique]], used its influence against the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its principles were publicly attacked by the President of the Academy, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the controversy, Collinson left the brotherhood and the remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or [[Walter Howell Deverell]], but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works "PRB".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The brotherhood found support from the critic [[John Ruskin]], who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as [[Effie Gray]]). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, James S. (1999). ''John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures'', pp. 36–37. Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Effie became increasingly attached to Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, pp. 49–94.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated.

&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-[[consummation]], leaving Effie free to marry Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Dearden (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved,&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Michael |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of art terms - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=9780199569922}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term "Pre-Raphaelite" stuck to Rossetti and others, including [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], with whom he became involved in [[Oxford]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Whiteley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteley |first=Jon |title=Oxford and the Pre-Raphaelites |year=1989 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |location=Oxford |isbn=0907849946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with the much wider and long-lived art movement, including the dreamy, yearning images of women produced by Rossetti and several of his followers.

==Later developments and influence==
[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Medea]]'' by Evelyn De Morgan, 1889, in [[quattrocento]] style]]
Artists influenced by the brotherhood include [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[Philip Calderon]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Evelyn De Morgan]],&lt;ref name=hilton202&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Sandys]] (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857)&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt; and [[John William Waterhouse]]. [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]], who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt;

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models like [[Jane Morris]], in paintings such as ''Proserpine'', ''The Blue Silk Dress'', and ''La Pia de' Tolomei''. His work influenced his friend [[William Morris]], in whose firm [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris's company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in [[medieval]] designs and other crafts leading to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the [[Della Robbia Pottery]] company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.

[[File:The Death of King Arthur by James Archer (1860).jpg|thumb|left|James Archer, ''The Death of King Arthur'', 1860]]
Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821-1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823-1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fineartbookstore.com/s-120-Pre-Raphaelites|title=Fine Art Books Art Instruction {{!}} Photography Books {{!}} Visual Arts Periods, Groups &amp; Movements: Pre-Raphaelites|last=|first=|date=|website=fineartbookstore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century. Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. In the late 20th century the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] and the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] have also derived inspiration from it.

[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bucher (2004) for a brief discussion on the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites.
[[File:Arthur Hughes - Fair Rosamund - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], ''Fair Rosamund'', 1854]]
In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. Since the Pre-Raphaelites were fixed on portraying things with near-photographic precision, though with a distinctive attention to detailed surface-patterns, their work was devalued by many painters and critics. After the [[First World War]], British [[Modernism|Modernists]] associated Pre-Raphaelite art with the repressive and backward times in which they grew up. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London's [[Tate Gallery]], re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work.&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, Tim (1999). ''Reading the Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 17. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at [[Tate Britain]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde ''Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde''], Tate Britain, accessed 27 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the ‘inner’ Pre-Raphaelite circle ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]) and ‘outer’ circle ([[Frederick Sandys]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Simeon Solomon]], [[Henry Hugh Armstead]], [[Joseph Noel Paton]], [[Frederic Shields]], [[Matthew James Lawless]]) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Illustration: The Pre-Raphaelites, the Idyllic School and the High Victorians|last=Goldman|first=Paul|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=2004|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=1–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its “noble grounds for noble emotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: “The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Robert W.|date=October 1871|title=The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D.G. Rossetti|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=|pages=|via=}} as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize [[subject painting]], which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the [[Sister Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/1.1.html|title=Chapter One: Ruskin's Theories of the Sister Arts — Ut Pictura Poesis|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter from D.G. Rossetti to William Allingham|last=Rossetti|first=Dante Gabriel|work=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1855, Rossetti wrote to [[William Allingham]] about the independence of illustration: “I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the ‘Vision of Sin’ and ‘Palace of Art’ etc. – those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This passage makes apparent Rossetti’s desire to not just support the poet’s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==
[[File:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'', 1851]]
There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Tate Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]], [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], and Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones' ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'', [[Frederic Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Flaming June]]'', and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and [[Frederic Sandys]].

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the [[Oxford Union]], depicting scenes from the [[Arthurian legend]]s, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones.  The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] houses at [[Wightwick Manor]], [[Wolverhampton]], and at [[Wallington Hall]], [[Northumberland]], both have significant and representative collections. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 2003.

[[Kelmscott Manor]], the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris' work ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. It also appears in the background of [[Water Willow (Rossetti)|''Water Willow'']], a portrait of his wife, [[Jane Morris]], painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in 1871.  There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti’s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two [[BBC]] television series. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' by [[Peter Bowker]]. Although much of the latter's material is derived from [[Franny Moyle]]'s factual book ''Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/25/romantics.shtml Desperate Romantics press pack: introduction] ''BBC Press Office''. Retrieved on 24 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: "In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC2 drama on icons among Pre-Raphaelites |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6626470.ece|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Russell]]'s television film ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by [[Oliver Reed]].

'''''Punishment and Social Structure''''' (1939), a book written by [[Georg Rusche]] and [[Otto Kirchheimer]], is the seminal [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] analysis of [[punishment]] as a social institution. It represents the 'most sustained and comprehensive account of punishment to have emerged from within the Marxist tradition’ and ‘succeeds in opening up a whole vista of understanding which simply did not exist before it was written' (Garland 1990: 89, 110). It is a central text in radical criminology, and an influential work in criminological [[conflict theory]], cited as a foundation text in several major textbooks (''Oxford Handbook of Criminology'' 2007; Newburn 2007; Innes 2003). It offers a broader (macrosociological) level of analysis than many micro-analyses that focus on the atomised and differentiated individual (Jacobs 1977: 91).

The work is extensively cited by both critical theorists and radical criminologists (Garland and Young 1983: 7, 24), and has influenced seminal works in the sociology of imprisonment, being cited in, for example, modern classics such as Jacobs's ''Stateville'' (1977: 91), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977:24) and ''Punishing the Poor'' (2009: 206) by [[Loic Wacquant]]. The work represented a decisive step forward in the development of the criminological imagination regarding punishment, one that places it in significance 'alongside Durkheim's theory of punishment' (Garland 1990: 110). As such the work has been deployed extensively by eminent criminologists and sociologists as a critical lens to understand and explain contemporary phenomena such as mass imprisonment (Zimring and Hawkins 1993: 33), and there has been a significant revival of critical interest in the work. It is regarded as a 'classic', if frequently contested, text in the sociology of punishment, and criminology more generally (Melossi 1978: 79, 81).

==Background==

The origins of the book are complex and controversial. Rusche and Kirchheimer were exiles from [[Nazi Germany]] (Rusche had a Jewish mother and considered his origins 'mixed' (Melossi 2003: x); Kirchheimer was Jewish). Rusche fled to the United Kingdom, then to Palestine, and thence back to the United Kingdom, where he was interned as an enemy alien after the outbreak of war. Kirchheimer originally left for Paris.

They were part of a dispersed cohort of émigré German social scientists, many of whom had been associated with the International Institute of Social Research in Frankfurt am Main (also known as the Frankfurt Institute). This Institute, established in 1923, was closed by the German government in 1933, the year of the Nazi takeover. It transferred to [[Columbia University]], [[New York City|New York]], and many of the [[émigré]] scholars pursued their critical analyses of society there (Horkheimer 1938: ix).

The book ''Punishment and Social Structure'' originated in an article suggested by Rusche in 1931, that is, before leaving Germany. The article was ultimately delivered in 1933 and entitled ''Labour Market and Penal Sanction: Thoughts on the Sociology of Criminal Justice.'' It was felt by leading American sociologists/criminologists, [[Thorsten Sellin]] and [[Edwin Sutherland]], that the pivotal importance of the topic merited more extensive treatment than Rusche's article provided, for all its intrinsic conceptual originality (Melossi 2003: xiii).

At this point, famously, Rusche was 'not available' (Horkheimer 1938: x). The meaning of this euphemistic phrase in the book's preface remains contested. It is beyond dispute that Rusche was a controversial and erratic figure, leaving a trail of intrigue in his wake in his itinerant life after Germany (Melossi 2003: xiv-xx). This is how it came about that Kirchheimer was commissioned to rework and develop Rusche’s text, adding his own analysis, in particular concerning penal policy under Fascism, while retaining the bulk of the concepts found in Rusche’s original draft. The reconfigured work became the first book published by the newly constituted Institute.

==Central argument==

In its barest essentials Rusche and Kirchheimer propound a structuralist analysis of punishment, arguing that modes of punishment are social phenomena shaped by economic drivers (p5 - stand-alone page references relate to the 1968 edition). The concretised forms of punishment actually found correspond, they maintain, to the prevailing means of production. It is here that the Marxian stance of privileging the economic base is evident. This leads to the renowned claim that 'Punishment as such does not exist; only concrete systems of punishment and specific criminal practices exist. The object of our investigation, therefore, is punishment in its specific manifestations' (ibid.).

The books surveys the historic development of these 'specific manifestations', dividing the progression of punishment into three conceptual epochs: the early Middle Ages, which utilised penance and fines; the late Middle Ages, when sanctions became markedly more barbarous, including branding, mutilation, torture and execution; and then the coming of capitalism, where forms of punishment came to perceive the prisoner as a source of human labour, including galley slavery, transportation and penal servitude with hard labour. As the Enlightenment and the Modern period developed, prisons became more prominent.

Overall the authors hold that punishment is a species of class domination. It must be viewed as part of an intricate matrix of social control and 'not an isolated phenomenon subject only to its own special laws. It is an integral part of the whole social system, and shares its aspirations and its defects' (p.&amp;nbsp;207). It operates to enforce ruling class power. This point was forcefully made by Rusche in his 1933 essay: 'the criminal law and the daily work of the criminal courts are directed almost exclusively against those people whose class background, poverty, neglected education, or demoralization drove them to crime' (Rusche 1933: 11).

The authors argue that such class-skewed punishment provides only 'the illusion of security by covering the symptoms of social disease with a system of legal and moral value judgements' (p.&amp;nbsp;207). They conclude that although the futility of severe punishment and cruel treatment may be proven 'a thousand times … so long as society is unable to solve its social problems, repression, the easy way out, will always be accepted' (ibid.).

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
Following its publication in 1939, the book received little critical attention (Garland 1990: 106). In the late 1960s, however, the book's analytical stance and Marxian bent resonated with the developing school of critical criminology and its radical outlook. It generated considerable interest in the economic underpinning to the concept of punishment, and was effectively updated and reapplied in works such as Melossi and Pavarini's ''The Prison and the Factory'' (1981). The book has also been subjected to significant criticism, with commentators questioning its reductionist Marxian stance, with its overstatement of the influence of economic factors (Garland 1990: 108), the deterministic nature of the conclusions generated, the teleological problems inherent in the theme of punishment as a 'project' of the ruling class to reinforce its domination, and the book's vulnerability to various historical inexactitudes (Beattie 1986).

These qualifications notwithstanding, ''Punishment and Social Structure'' remains at the forefront of theoretical and analytical expositions of how if we are to understand punishment, we must be attentive to the dictates of social class and broader patterns of social domination and control. Its persuasive force lies in providing the clarity of a lens to view how punishment lies within 'much wider strategies for managing the poor and the lower classes' (Garland 1990: 110).

'''Ralph Leonard Kirkpatrick''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɜr|k|ˈ|p|æ|t|r|ɪ|k}}; June 10, 1911{{spaced ndash}}April 13, 1984) was an American musician, [[musicologist]] and [[harpsichord]]ist. He is best known for his chronological catalog of [[Domenico Scarlatti]]'s keyboard sonatas.

==Life and work==

Kirkpatrick was born in [[Leominster, Massachusetts]]. He studied Art History at [[Harvard University]] and went on to further studies with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and harpsichord revival pioneer [[Wanda Landowska]] in [[Paris]], as well as [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in [[Haslemere]], [[Heinz Tiessen]] in [[Berlin]] and [[Günther Ramin]] in [[Leipzig]]. From 1933 to 1934, he taught at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. A Guggenheim Scholarship later enabled him to study manuscripts and sources in Europe.

From 1940 he was a professor at [[Yale University]], where he published his biography of [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and a critical edition of 60 sonatas by Scarlatti (1953). Scarlatti's sonatas are now conventionally designated by their '''Kirkpatrick numbers''' (shown as Kk. --, and more recently with a single K.), which is now considered the standard, authoritative numbering system for these works (despite at least two rival systems)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halford|first=Margery|title=Scarlatti -- An Introduction to His Keyboard Works|date=1974|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=978-0739022153|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YmH3z0d1qoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see [[opus number]]).

During the 1960s Kirkpatrick made recordings of the complete [[harpsichord]] works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (Archiv). The instrument he used in these recordings was always one or other of the contemporary harpsichords being made at the time by the firm of JC Neupert of [[Bamberg]]. These days such instruments are called "revival" style instruments, their features including 'inauthentic' metal frames and robust, heavy construction. These recordings show Kirkpatrick's formidable keyboard technique to full advantage,  and, unusually for recordings of the time, he observes almost all of the repeats. His performances of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' were recorded on both the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavichord]]. His later Bach recordings used a reproduction French harpsichord by Hubbard &amp; Dowd.

He produced an edition of Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'' (1938, G. Schirmer, Inc. New York - 37149) which includes extensive discussion of ornamentation, fingering, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], tempo, dynamics, and general interpretation. He also authored the posthumously published ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier: A Performer's Discourse''.

Kirkpatrick also played modern music, including [[Quincy Porter]]'s Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra, [[Darius Milhaud]]'s Sonata for Violin and Harpsichord, and the Double Concerto for Harpsichord, Piano and Chamber Orchestra by [[Elliott Carter]], which was dedicated to him.

As a performer and recording artist, he became best known for his [[harpsichord]] performances of the keyboard music of Bach and Scarlatti. He also recorded on the [[clavichord]] (e.g. Bach's two- and three-part inventions, as well as both volumes of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'') and on the [[fortepiano]] (especially works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]).  He recalled playing a clavichord at a [[house concert]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kirkpatrick, "On Playing the Clavichord," ''Early Music'', Vol. 9, No. 3, Wind Issue (Jul., 1981), pp. 293-305 (Oxford University Press).

Kirkpatrick died in [[Guilford, Connecticut]] at the age of 72.

On April 2, 1999, the asteroid [[9902 Kirkpatrick]] is named in his honor.

His brother, {{Interlanguage link|Clifford Kirkpatrick|fr||WD=}} (1898-1971), is sociologist. His niece, Meredith Kirkpatrick, is his biographer [http://library.bu.edu/c.php?g=268287&amp;p=1790232 &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

The '''Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-hu|Magyar Tudományos Akadémia Nyelvtudományi Intézete}})  was created in 1949, is under supervision of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] since 1951. Its primary tasks include research in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[linguistics]], general, theoretical and applied linguistics, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] linguistics, and [[phonetics]], as well as the preparation of a comprehensive [[dictionary]] of the Hungarian language, and the maintenance of its archive materials. Other research projects investigate various aspects and different variants of Hungarian. Further tasks include the assembly of linguistic corpora and databases, and laying the linguistic groundwork for computational software and applications. The Institute also operates a public advice service on language and linguistics, prepares expert reports on relevant affairs on demand, and runs the Theoretical Linguistics Undergraduate and Doctoral Program jointly with [[Eötvös Loránd University]].

'''Restoration ecology''' is the scientific study supporting the practice of '''ecological restoration''', which is the practice of renewing and restoring [[environmental degradation|degraded]], damaged, or destroyed [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s in the [[Natural environment|environment]] by active human intervention and action.

==Definition==

Restoration ecology is the academic study of the process, whereas ecological restoration is the actual project or process by restoration practitioners. The Society for Ecological Restoration defines "ecological restoration" as an "intentional activity that initiates or accelerates the recovery of an ecosystem with respect to its health, integrity and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Society for Ecological Restoration International Science &amp; Policy Working Group|first=|date=2004|title=The SER International Primer on Ecological Restoration|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ser.org/resource/resmgr/custompages/publications/ser_publications/ser_primer.pdf|journal=www.ser.org &amp; Tucson: Society for Ecological Restoration International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological restoration includes a wide scope of projects including [[erosion]] control, [[reforestation]], removal of [[non-native species]] and weeds, [[revegetation]] of disturbed areas, [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting streams]], reintroduction of [[native species]] (preferably native species that have [[local adaptation]]), and habitat and range improvement for targeted species.

[[E. O. Wilson]], a biologist, states, "Here is the means to end the great extinction spasm. The next century will, I believe, be the era of restoration in ecology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/691398594|title=The diversity of life|last=O.|first=Wilson, Edward|date=2010, ©1992|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674058170|edition=  1st Harvard University Press paperback |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=691398594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of restoration ecology==
'''Restoration ecology''' emerged as a separate field in [[ecology]] in the late twentieth century. "Restoration ecology" was not first formally identified as a distinct scientific field until the late twentieth century. The term was coined by [[John Aber]] and [[Bill Jordan (environmental critic)|William Jordan III]] when they were at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref name="jordan2011"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750183084|title=Making nature whole : a history of ecological restoration|last=Jordan, III|first=W. R.|date=2011|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781610910422|location=Washington, DC|oclc=750183084}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[indigenous peoples]], land managers, stewards, and laypeople have been practicing ecological restoration or ecological management for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="anderson2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56103978|title=Tending the wild: Native American knowledge and the management of California's natural resources|last=Anderson|first=K.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520238567|location=Berkeley|oclc=56103978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered the birthplace of modern ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum]].&lt;ref name="court2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/814694131|title=Pioneers of ecological restoration : the people and legacy of the University of Wisconsin Arboretum|last=Court|first=F.

Greene]], and plant ecologist [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]]. Curtis and his graduate students surveyed the whole of Wisconsin, documenting native species communities and creating the first species lists for tallgrass restorations.&lt;ref name="curtis1971"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811410421|title=The vegetation of Wisconsin : an ordination of plant communities|last=Curtis|first=J. T.|date=1971|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299019433|location=Madison|oclc=811410421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing prairie remnants, such as locations within pioneer [[cemeteries]] and railroad rights-of-way, were located and inventoried by Curtis and his team. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]], and pioneering techniques like [[Controlled burn|prescribed burning]].&lt;ref name="court2012"/&gt;

The latter-half of the 20th century saw the growth of ecological restoration beyond Wisconsin borders. The 285-hectare Green Oaks Biological Field Station at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]] began in 1955 under the guidance of zoologist Paul Shepard. It was followed by the 40-hectare Schulenberg Prairie at the [[Morton Arboretum]], started in 1962 by Ray Schulenberg and Bob Betz. Betz then worked with [[The Nature Conservancy]] to establish the 260-hectare [[Fermilab|Fermi National Laboratory]] tallgrass prairie in 1974.&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermilab History &amp; Archives Project: Natural History - Prairie |url=https://history.fnal.gov/prairie.html |website=fnal.gov |publisher=Fermilab |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These major tallgrass restoration projects marked the growth of ecological restoration from isolated studies to widespread practice.

Australia has also been the site of historically significant ecological restoration projects. In 1935 Ambrose Crawford commenced restoring a degraded four acres (1.7 hectares) patch of the Big Scrub (Lowland Tropical Rainforest) at Lumley Park reserve, Alstonville, in northern New South Wales. Clearing of weeds and planting of suitable indigenous flora species were his main restoration techniques. The restored rainforest reserve still exists today and is home to threatened plant and animal species. In 1936 [[Albert Morris]] and his restoration colleagues initiated the Broken Hill regeneration area project, which involved the natural regeneration of indigenous flora on a severely degraded site of hundreds of hectares in arid western New South Wales. Completed in 1958, the successful project still maintains ecological function today as the ''Broken Hill regeneration area''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William R. &amp; Lubick, George M.

== Theoretical foundations of restoration ecology ==

Restoration ecology draws on a wide range of ecological concepts.

=== Disturbance ===

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] is a change in environmental conditions that disrupts the functioning of an ecosystem. Disturbance can occur at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and is a natural component of many communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173134455|title=Assembly rules and restoration ecology : bridging the gap between theory and practice|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Island Press|others=Temperton, Vicky M.|year=|isbn=9781429495134|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=|chapter=Chapter 17: Disturbance, Succession, and Community Assembly in Terrestrial Plant Communities|oclc=173134455}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many forest and grassland restorations implement [[fire ecology|fire as a natural disturbance regime]]. However the severity and scope of anthropogenic impact has grown in the last few centuries. Differentiating between human-caused and naturally occurring disturbances is important if we are  to understand how to restore natural processes and minimize [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts on the ecosystems.

=== Succession ===

[[Ecological succession]] is the process by which a community changes over time, especially following a disturbance. In many instances, an ecosystem will change from a simple level of organization with  a few dominant [[pioneer species]] to an increasingly complex community with many interdependent species. Restoration often consists of initiating, assisting, or accelerating ecological successional processes, depending on the severity of the disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21376331|title=Directing ecological succession|last=1955-|first=Luken, James O.,|date=1990|publisher=Chapman and Hall|isbn=0412344505|edition= 1st |location=London|oclc=21376331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following mild to moderate natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances, restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, in a system that has experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment), restoration may require intensive efforts to recreate environmental conditions that favor natural successional processes.

=== Fragmentation ===

[[Habitat fragmentation]] describes spatial discontinuities in a biological system, where ecosystems are broken up into smaller parts through land use changes (e.g. [[agriculture]]) and natural disturbance. This both reduces the size of the populations and increases the degree of isolation. These smaller and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Fragmenting ecosystems decreases quality of the habitat. The [[Edge effects|edge of a fragment]] has a different range of environmental conditions and therefore supports different species than the interior. Restorative projects can increase the effective size of a population by adding suitable habitat and decrease isolation by creating [[wildlife corridor|habitat corridor]]s that link isolated fragments. Reversing the effects of fragmentation is an important component of restoration ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Targeted habitat restoration can reduced extinction rates in fragrmented forests|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9635.abstract|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem function ===
Ecosystem function describes the most basic and essential foundational processes of any natural systems, including [[nutrient cycle]]s and [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flux]]es. An understanding of the complexity of these ecosystem functions is necessary to address any ecological processes that may be degraded. Ecosystem functions are [[emergent properties]] of the [[Systems theory|system as a whole]], thus monitoring and [[Natural resource management|management]] are crucial for the long-term stability of ecosystems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}A fully functional ecosystem that is completely self-perpetuating is the ultimate goal of restorative efforts.

=== Community assembly ===

Community assembly "is a framework that can unify virtually all of (community) ecology under a single conceptual umbrella".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894509632|title=Urban ecology : an introduction|last=1936-|first=Douglas, Ian,|others=James, Philip (Professor of ecology),|isbn=9781136266966|location=New York, NY|oclc=894509632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community assembly theory attempts to explain the existence of environmentally similar sites with differing assemblages of species. It assumes that species have similar [[ecological niche|niche]] requirements, so that community formation is a product of random fluctuations from a common [[species pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P.|last2=Chase|first2=Jonathan M.|last3=Huddleston|first3=Russell T.|date=2001|title=Community Succession and Assembly: Comparing, Contrasting and Combining Paradigms in the Context of Ecological Restoration|jstor=43440887|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=19|issue=1|pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, if all species are fairly ecologically equivalent, then random variation in colonization, and migration and extinction rates between species, drive differences in species composition between sites with comparable environmental conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Population genetics ===
Genetic diversity has shown to be as important as species diversity for restoring ecosystem processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=A. Randall|last2=Inouye|first2=Brian D.|last3=Johnson|first3=Marc T. J.|last4=Underwood|first4=Nora|last5=Vellend|first5=Mark|date=2008-04-08|title=Ecological consequences of genetic diversity|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=609–623|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01179.x|issn=1461-023X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ecological restorations are increasingly factoring genetic processes into management practices.  Population genetic processes that are important to consider in restored populations include [[founder effect]]s, [[inbreeding depression]], [[outbreeding depression]], [[genetic drift]], and [[gene flow]]. Such processes can predict whether or not a species successfully establishes at a restoration site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Rice|first2=Susan L.

== Applications of restoration ecology ==

=== Soil heterogeneity effects on community heterogeneity ===

Spatial heterogeneity of resources can influence plant community composition, diversity, and assembly trajectory. Baer et al. (2005) manipulated [[soil]] resource heterogeneity in a tallgrass [[prairie restoration]] project. They found increasing resource heterogeneity, which on its own was insufficient to insure [[species diversity]] in situations where one species may dominate across the range of resource levels. Their findings were consistent with the theory regarding the role of ecological filters on community assembly. The establishment of a single species, [[adaptation|best adapted]] to the physical and biological conditions can play an inordinately important role in determining the community structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Sara G.|last2=Collins|first2=Scott L|last3=Blair|first3=John M.|last4=Knapp|first4=Alan K.|last5=Fiedler|first5=Anna K.|date=2005-06|title=Soil Heterogeneity Effects on Tallgrass Prairie Community Heterogeneity: An Application of Ecological Theory to Restoration Ecology|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00051.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=413–424|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2005.00051.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invasion and restoration ===

Restoration is used as a tool for reducing the spread of invasive plant species in a number of ways. The first method views restoration primarily as a means to reduce the presence of invasive species and limit their spread.  As this approach emphasizes control of invaders, the restoration techniques can differ from typical restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epanchin-Niell|first=Rebecca|last2=Englin|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Nalle|first3=Darek|date=November 2009|title=Investing in rangeland restoration in the Arid West, USA: Countering the effects of an invasive weed on the long-term fire cycle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709003004|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=91|issue=2|pages=370–379|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Török|first=Péter|last2=Miglécz|first2=Tamás|last3=Valkó|first3=Orsolya|last4=Kelemen|first4=András|last5=Deák|first5=Balázs|last6=Lengyel|first6=Szabolcs|last7=Tóthmérész|first7=Béla|date=January 2012|title=Recovery of native grass biodiversity by sowing on former croplands: Is weed suppression a feasible goal for grassland restoration?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161713811100046X|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|volume=20|issue=1|pages=41–48|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2011.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of such projects is not necessarily to restore an entire ecosystem or habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|title=Selecting Plant Species for Ecological Restoration: a Perspective for Land Managers|last=Brown|first=Ray|last2=Amacher|first2=Michael|date=1999|website=USDA Forest Service Proceedings RMRS-P-8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505022949/https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_p008/rmrs_p008_001_016.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These projects frequently use lower diversity mixes of aggressive native species seeded at high density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Rob G.|last2=Orloff|first2=Steve B.|last3=Lancaster|first3=Donald L.|last4=Kirby|first4=Donald W.|last5=Carlson|first5=Harry L.|date=2010|title=Integrating Herbicide Use and Perennial Grass Revegetation to Suppress Weeds in Noncrop Areas|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/invasive-plant-science-and-management/article/integrating-herbicide-use-and-perennial-grass-revegetation-to-suppress-weeds-in-noncrop-areas/31659B7952971D35546D9EE56DE9DC5B|journal=Invasive Plant Science and Management|volume=3|issue=1|pages=81–92|doi=10.1614/ipsm-09-008.1|issn=1939-7291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not always actively managed following seeding.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kettenring|first=Karin M.|last2=Adams|first2=Carrie Reinhardt|date=2011-08-01|title=Lessons learned from invasive plant control experiments: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=48|issue=4|pages=970–979|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01979.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target areas for this type of restoration are those which are heavily dominated by invasive species. The goals are to first remove the species and then in so doing, reduce the number of invasive seeds being spread to surrounding areas. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing weeds, although it is not always a sustainable solution long term without additional weed control, such as mowing, or re-seeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Blumenthal,|last2=Nicholas|first2=Jordan,|last3=Elizabeth|first3=Svenson,|date=2003-03-06|title=Weed Control as a Rationale for Restoration: The Example of Tallgrass Prairie|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/art6/|journal=Conservation Ecology|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.5751/ES-00480-070106|issn=1195-5449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Dana M.|last2=Jordan|first2=Nicholas R.|last3=Svenson|first3=Elizabeth L.|date=2005-05-20|title=Effects of prairie restoration on weed invasions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880904003603|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=107|issue=2–3|pages=221–230|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2004.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration projects are also used as a way to better understand what makes an ecological community resistant to invasion. As restoration projects have a broad range of implementation strategies and methods used to control invasive species, they can be used by ecologists to test theories about invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Restoration projects have been used to understand how the diversity of the species introduced in the restoration affects invasion.

=== Successional trajectories ===

Progress along a desired successional pathway may be difficult if multiple stable states exist. Looking over 40 years of wetland restoration data, Klötzli and Gootjans (2001) argue that unexpected and undesired vegetation assemblies "may indicate that environmental conditions are not suitable for target communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotzli|first=Frank|last2=Grootjans|first2=Ab P.|date=2001-06|title=Restoration of Natural and Semi-Natural Wetland Systems in Central Europe: Progress and Predictability of Developments|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002209.x|issn=1061-2971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succession may move in unpredicted directions, but constricting environmental conditions within a narrow range may rein in the possible successional trajectories and increase the likelihood of a desired outcome.

=== Sourcing material for restoration ===
For most restoration projects it is generally recommend to source material from local populations, to increase chance of restoration success and minimize the effects of [[maladaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

For example, sourcing for ''Castilleja levisecta'' found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth A.|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas N.|date=2011-03-01|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00549.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|issue=2|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of ecological restoration==
[[File:Regenerated habitat for superb parrot on the abandoned Boroowa railway line.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Ecosystem restoration for the [[superb parrot]] on an abandoned railway line in Australia]]

===Rationale===
There are many reasons to restore ecosystems.  Some include:

*Restoring [[natural capital]] such as drinkable water or wildlife populations 
*Mitigating [[climate change]] (e.g. through [[carbon sequestration]])
*Helping threatened or [[endangered species]]&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aesthetic reasons &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris JA, Hobbs RJ, Higgs ES, and Aronson JA.|first=|year=2006|title=Ecological restoration and climate change|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=14|pages=170–76.|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00136.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moral reasons: Human intervention has unnaturally destroyed many habitats, and there exists an innate obligation to restore these destroyed habitats

[[File:Restoration in action at Buffelsdraai.jpg|250px|right|thumb|alt=Buffelsdraai Community Reforestation Project.|Forest restoration in action at the [[Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project]] in South Africa]]

There exist considerable differences of opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It can be difficult to set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, "ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [with restoration] we aim [for a] moving target."

Some conservationists argue that, though an ecosystem may not be returned to its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its current configuration (Bradshaw 1987).  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation. [[Afforestation]] involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air. [[Carbon dioxide]] is a leading cause of [[global warming]] (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Another example of a common driver of restoration projects in the United States is the legal framework of the Clean Water Act, which often requires mitigation for damage inflicted on aquatic systems by development or other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/compensatory-mitigation-methods|title=Compensatory Mitigation Methods|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological restoration challenges ==
Some view ecosystem restoration as impractical, partially because restorations often fall short of their goals.  Hilderbrand et al. point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for 'complete' restoration are unreasonably short, while other critical markers for full-scale restoration are either ignored or abridged due to feasibility concerns.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hilderbrand, R. H., A. C. Watts, and A. M. Randle 2005. The myths of restoration ecology. Ecology and Society 10(1): 19. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol10/iss1/art19/&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing a severely degraded ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOLL|first=KAREN D.|last2=HAYES|first2=GREY F.|date=2006-02-27|title=Challenges to Introducing and Managing Disturbance Regimes for Holocarpha macradenia, an Endangered Annual Grassland Forb|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1121–1131|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00416.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local communities sometimes object to restorations that include the introduction of large predators or plants that require [[disturbance regimes]] such as regular fires, citing threat to human habitation in the area.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=David|date=2002|title=The ecological context: a species population perspective|url=|journal=Handbook of ecological restoration|volume=1|pages=47–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High economic costs can also be perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.

Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits they will not support it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration, or an incomplete understanding of the underlying ecological framework lead to insufficient measures. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, "people may not [always] know how to manage natural systems effectively".&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, P. 2002. Managing the wild: should stewards be pilots? Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 9(2): 494-499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as [[carbon copy]], where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Science-practice gap ===
One of the struggles for both fields is a divide between restoration ecology and ecological restoration in practice. Currently, many restoration practitioners as well as scientists feel that science is not being adequately incorporated into ecological restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickens|first=Sara Jo M.|last2=Suding|first2=Katharine N.|date=2013-06-01|title=Spanning the Science-Practice Divide: Why Restoration Scientists Need to be More Involved with Practice|url=http://er.uwpress.org/content/31/2/134|journal=Ecological Restoration|volume=31|issue=2|pages=134–140|doi=10.3368/er.31.2.134|issn=1522-4740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|last2=Clewell|first2=Andre|last3=Ingram|first3=Mrill|last4=McDonald|first4=Tein|last5=Temperton|first5=Vicky|date=2010-11-01|title=Bridging Restoration Science and Practice: Results and Analysis of a Survey from the 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International Meeting|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00743.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=18|issue=6|pages=783–788|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2010.00743.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Erica|last2=Dixon|first2=Kingsley W.|last3=Menz|first3=Myles H.

There are a variety of theories about the cause of this gap. However, it has been well established that one of the main issues is that the questions studied by restoration ecologists are frequently not found useful or easily applicable by land managers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabin|first=Robert J.|date=2007-03-01|title=Science-Driven Restoration: A Square Grid on a Round Earth?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00183.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00183.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many publications in restoration ecology characterize the scope of a problem in depth, without providing concrete solutions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally many restoration ecology studies are carried out under controlled conditions and frequently at scales much smaller than actual restorations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whether or not these patterns hold true in an applied context is often unknown. There is evidence that these small-scale experiments inflate type II error rates and differ from ecological patterns in actual restorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duc|first=M. G.

There is further complication in that restoration ecologists who want to collect large-scale data on restoration projects can face enormous hurdles in obtaining the data. Managers vary in how much data they collect, and how many records they keep. Some agencies keep only a handful of physical copies of data that make it difficult for the researcher to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Emily S.|last2=Sudduth|first2=Elizabeth B.|last3=Palmer|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Allan|first4=J.

== Contrasting restoration ecology and conservation biology ==

Restoration ecology may be viewed as a sub-discipline of [[conservation biology]], the scientific study of how to protect and restore biodiversity. Ecological restoration is then a part of the resulting [[conservation movement]].

Both restoration ecologists and conservation biologists agree that protecting and restoring habitat is important for protecting biodiversity. However, [[conservation biology]] is primarily rooted in [[population biology]]. Because of that, it is generally organized at the [[Population genetics|population genetic]] level and assesses specific species populations (i.e. [[endangered species]]). Restoration ecology is organized at the [[Community (ecology)|community]] level, which focuses on broader groups within ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Truman P|date=2000-01|title=Restoration ecology and conservation biology|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320799000579|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=92|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(99)00057-9|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, conservation biology often concentrates on [[vertebrate]] animals because of their salience and popularity, whereas restoration ecology concentrates on [[plant]]s. Restoration ecology focuses on plants because restoration projects typically begin by establishing plant communities. Ecological restoration, despite being focused on plants, may also have "poster species" for individual ecosystems and restoration projects.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, the [[Monarch butterfly]] is a poster species for conserving and restoring [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant habitat, because Monarch butterflies require milkweed plants to reproduce. Finally, restoration ecology has a stronger focus on [[soil]]s, [[soil structure]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[microorganism]]s because soils provide the foundation of functional terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Craig D|date=2002|title=Ecological restoration of southwestern Ponderosa pine ecosystems: A broad perspective|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1418–1433|doi=10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1418:EROSPP]2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.

==Natural Capital Committee's recommendation for a 25-year plan==
The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] (NCC) made a recommendation in its second State of Natural Capital report published in March 2014 that in order to meet the Government's goal of being the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it was inherited, a long-term 25-year plan was needed to maintain and improve England's natural capital.  The UK Government has not yet responded to this recommendation.

The Secretary of State for the UK's [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Owen Paterson]], described his ambition for the natural environment and how the work of the Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012:  "I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. I want us to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/owen-paterson-s-speech-to-royal-society-on-natural-capital-committee|title=Owen Paterson’s speech to Royal Society on Natural Capital Committee|last=Paterson|first=Owen|date=27 November 2012|work=gov.uk|access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea ice thickness determines a number of important fluxes such as heat flux between the air and ocean surface—see below—as well as salt and fresh water fluxes between the ocean since saline water ejects much of its salt content when frozen—see [[sea ice growth processes]]. It is also important for [[navigators]] on [[icebreaker]]s since there is an upper limit to the thickness of ice any ship can sail through.

==Measurement==
{{See also|Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice thickness}}
Ice thickness can be measured in various ways, directly by taking an [[ice core]] and measuring it or more efficient with satellite measurements. Measurements of ice depth below the waterline (or [[draft (hull)|draft]]) by submarine [[sonar]] or [[radar]] systems can give good estimates of ice thickness provided there isn't too much snow (which is less dense than ice) on top.

{{anchor|Freeboard}}''Sea ice [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]]'' is the difference between the height of the surface of sea ice and the water in open leads.  Since 7/8ths of the ice is below the waterline, the computation of the thickness is fairly simple,&lt;ref name= "BBC - Cryosat mission delivers first sea-ice map"&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13829785 | title = Cryosat mission delivers first sea-ice map | publisher = [[BBC]] | date=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however accurate measurement of ice freeboard is hindered by several factors including snow cover, and modeling of this data is being constantly improved.

===Satellites===
The [[ICESat|Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite]] (ICESat), measured ice sheet mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, and land topography and vegetation characteristics, with an active service period  from February 2003 to October 2009.&lt;ref name="EOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1002/25icesat/|title=  	
ICESat mission complete after seven years in orbit|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Spaceflight Now|first=Stephen|last=Clark|accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Space Agency [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity]] (SMOS) mission is the first orbit mission to measure salinity of the Earth’s surface and able to show data through most clouds and during darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SMOS: The Challenging Sea Surface Salinity Measurement from Space|display-authors=4|author=J. Font|author2= A. Camps|author3=A. Borges|author4=M. Martin-Neira|author5=J. Boutin|author6=N. Reul|author7=Y. Kerr|author8= A. Hahne|author9=S.

The sea ice volume is calculated with the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS).

=== Other methods ===
The E-M Bird ice thickness meter, designed by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], is carried aloft by helicopter and measures ice thickness with a combination of a pair of [[inductor|inductance coils]] that measure the ice-water interface based [[inductance]] variations—similar to a [[metal detector]]—and a [[LIDAR|laser altimeter]] which measures the ice surface.&lt;ref name="smos_final"&gt;

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|300px|A Signares ball, with European men.]]
'''Signare''' was the name for the [[Mulatto]] French-African women of the island of [[Gorée]] in [[French Senegal]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. These women of color managed to gain some individual assets, status, and power in the hierarchies of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Signares of St. Louis and Gorée: Women Entrepreneurs in Eighteenth-Century Senegal|last = Brooks|first = George|publisher = |year = 1976|isbn = |location = |pages = 19–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and economic role==
Signares commonly had power in networks of trade and wealth within the limitations of slavery. The influence held by these women led to changes in gender roles in the family structure archetype. Some owned masses of land as well as slaves. European merchants and traders, especially the French and British, would settle on coastal societies inhabited by signares in order to benefit from the increased proximity to the sources of African commerce. The earliest of these merchants were the Portuguese. These merchants were given the name "''[[lançados]]''", because "they threw themselves" among Africans, and they would establish relationships with the most influential signares who would accept them in order to obtain commercial privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hafkin, Nancy J., and Edna G. Bay. ''Women in Africa: Studies in Social and Economic Change''. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many signares were wed under “common local law” that was recognized by priests of the Catholic faith. These marriages were for economic and social reasons. Both signares and their husbands gained from these partnerships. Europeans passed their names down to the offspring and with it their lineage.

[[File:La Signare de Gorée avec ses esclaves-Musée de la Compagnie des Indes.jpg|thumb|A signare on [[Gorée]] along with her slaves.]]
When some of the signares became too powerful, leaders like the Portuguese Crown sought ways to remove the women from their wealth.  Different crimes that the Portuguese Crown sought to accuse the women of were crimes against the state or crimes against Christianity. An example of this appears with [[Bibiana Vaz|Bibiana Vuz de França]]. She was a prominent signare who over the years accumulated a lot of wealth and slaves. After realizing how powerful that she was, the Crown wanted to find a way dismantle her influence and power.  “Accused of rebellion, trading with foreigners, and tax evasion, she was imprisoned with her younger brother and another co-conspirator and taken to Cape Verde Islands”.&lt;ref&gt;Havik, Philip J.. Women and trade in the Guinea Bissau region: the role of African and Luso-African women in trade networks from the early 16th to the mid 19th century.2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was able to receive a royal pardon and free her younger brother after leading a coup against the Crown’s representatives.  Due to her power, the Crown sought to criminalize Bibiana Vuz de França. However, once they realized that she was too powerful and too influential, all charges against her were dropped and she was once more considered loyal to the crown. Bibiana Vuz de França’s confrontation with the Portuguese Crown represents the strength that the signares in this time period had, and also the Portuguese growing inability to control the people.

=== Social mobility ===

The social status of signares also allowed for greater social mobility in Gorée than in other parts of Africa. Though there is limited documentation on the origins of most of the signares, it seems likely that at this time the people of Gorée were divided into several social classes: the ''jambor ''or freeborn; the ''jam'' or people of slave descent; the ''tega ''and ''uga ''or blacksmiths and leatherworkers and ''griots ''or storytellers. 

Many signares were of the ''jam ''or ''griot'' class, and were often married by European men because they were considered especially beautiful. Once married to European men, women helped them handle many of their trading affairs and transactions, and gained economic and social stature in the community themselves. In this way women of lower social status could gain power in the community and become important traders through their marital status.

=== Marital practices ===
Marriages between African women and European men were governed by local law. Given the fact that many European men would not stay in Gorée permanently, marriages were often in a state of flux. If a European man left Gorée and intended to return, the African woman would wait for him. When the man got on the boat to go back to Europe, signares would scoop up the sand where his last footprints were and put it a handkerchief, which she'd hang on her bedpost it until he returned. Signares would often wait years for men to return without remarrying. 

If European men left without planning to return, or if a signare learned that her European husband was not going to return to Gorée, women would remarry. This was not considered shameful in any way, and signares would not lose any of their social status, and would often retain much of the trading power that they gained through their prior marital status. Remarried signares would often raise their children from their European husbands alongside their new African husbands, and these children would receive inheritance from their mothers, not their fathers.

She has been Professor of [[Women's studies]] at the [[University of York |University of York, England]] since 1998,&lt;ref name="University of York, 2014"&gt;University of York, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and is Director of the University's Centre for Women's Studies.

== Education ==
Stevi Jackson earned her degree in Sociology from the [[University of Kent]] in 1972. In 1973 she gained her Masters from the [[University of York]].&lt;ref name="University of York, 2014"/&gt;

== Writings ==
She has been writing on feminist topics since 1973, and describes her research as an attempt to explain and theorise her own experience of being a heterosexual woman.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 1999c: 1&lt;/ref&gt; She explicitly states throughout her work that she is a heterosexual feminist working within a materialist framework. Jackson has been politically active throughout her life, particularly in the 1970s when she engaged in [[consciousness raising]] groups, went to national conferences and helped to set up Rape Crisis in Cardiff. During the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher years]], she joined [[Labour Party (UK)|the Labour party]] to counter the damage she saw being done by the government. She says Labour was “a good base for feminist campaigning”.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2009a"&gt;Jackson, 2009a&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, she shied away from action during the "sex wars" which attacked heterosexual feminists for fraternising with the "enemy".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson and Scott, 1996: 11&lt;/ref&gt; She found this period destructive for [[feminism]] and as a heterosexual feminist, preferred to stay out of the debates on the issue. Recently, her political action has involved trying to keep women's studies alive as a space for women to explore feminism but regrets that rising higher in academia leaves less time for feminist action.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2009a"/&gt; She believes it is important to build a bridge between [[feminist theory]] and practice which is why she particularly enjoyed writing for [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] magazine ''Trouble and Strife''.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2009a"&gt;Jackson, 2009a&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's [[utopia]] is an egalitarian world without gender where “your genitals matter as little as your hair colour”.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2009a"/&gt; A world where marriage is abolished and those who wish to commit to one another engage in civil partnerships. She advocates a collective model of [[Parenting|child rearing]] and believes that heterosexual, monogamous couples are not necessarily the best parents.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2009a"&gt;Jackson, 2009a&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Making of the Pentateuch''''' ("The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study", JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1987) by [[R. N. Whybray]], Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies at the University of Hull (UK), was a major contribution to the field of Old Testament studies, and specifically to theories on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch. Its originality lay in its detailed critique of the [[documentary hypothesis]], and it remains a standard text on many reading lists.

== Background ==
For almost a century prior to Whybray's book, a scholarly consensus had developed regarding the question of Pentateuchal origins{{snd}} the composition and dates of the first five books of the [[Old Testament]]. In the closing decades of the 19th century [[Julius Wellhausen]] published ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'', in which he had set out the definitive version of the historical development of the [[Hebrew bible]]. According to this hypothesis, the [[Pentateuch]]{{snd}} [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]{{snd}} was originally four separate documents, retelling the same episodes and stories, but with differing emphases designed to further the theological and political agendas of their authors. Their combination by a [[Redactor]] (editor) into a single narrative spread over five books had resulted in many inconsistencies and repetitious stories, which could be analysed through the methodology of [[source criticism]] to reconstruct the original documents.

Wellhausen had concentrated exclusively on the written text of the Pentateuch, but in the next generation [[Hermann Gunkel]] developed [[form criticism]], a methodology which he claimed could identify the various genres which had contributed to the text and thus reconstruct its [[tradition history]]. Gunkel and his followers, notably [[Martin Noth]], used this new methodology to discover the oral [[saga]]s which formed the basis of the written texts of the Pentateuch.

By the middle of the 20th century, Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis, the tradition history of Gunkel and Noth, and the [[Biblical archaeology]] of [[William F. Albright]], who claimed to have found physical proof of the 2nd millennium BC origins of Genesis, Exodus, and the other books of the Pentateuch, had merged to form a dominant paradigm, or consensual view, of the origins of the Pentateuch{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. It was this paradigm that was challenged by Whybray's "The Making of the Pentateuch".

== Summary ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' (in fact only Genesis–Numbers, as Whybray excludes Deuteronomy) is in three parts. Part 1 examines the methodology and assumptions of source criticism and the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]; Part 2 examines the methodology of form criticism and tradition history as developed by Noth and others; and Part 3 sets out Whybray's own suggestions for the process by which the Pentateuch came to be composed.&lt;ref name="j1518470"&gt;J. A. Emerton [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1518470 ''Vetus Testamentum''], Vol. 39, Fasc. 1 (Jan., 1989), pp. 110–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Whybray's attack on the documentary hypothesis addressed the basic methodology of source criticism, which relies on the existence of inconsistencies, repetitions and stylistic features such as alternative names for God to identify distinctive sources within the biblical text. The assumptions behind this methodology, Whybray says, are illogical and self-contradictory. If the authors of the original documents did not tolerate contradiction and repetition, why did the editors of the final work do so? And if the writers who created the final document did not mind such features, why should we suppose that the earlier sources did not contain contradiction and repetition? "Thus the hypothesis can only be maintained on the assumption that, while consistency was the hallmark of the various documents, inconsistency was the hallmark of the redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;19). Similarly, the repetition and stylistic variation which the documentary hypothesis explains as the remains of distinct sources, may be understood quite differently. For example, since other religious texts use a variety of names for God, why should the change of divine name in Genesis from [[YHWH|Yahweh]] to [[Elohim]] signal a change of source? There could be a theological reason why one name is preferred to another, or the writer may just want a change. Repetition is often done for stylistic reasons, or for emphasis, or for rhetorical effect or in poetic parallelism. The task of form and tradition critics, according to Whybray, is even more difficult than that of source critics. Where the latter are dealing with partially extant texts, the former are dealing with hypothetical reconstructions for which we have no tangible evidence: "Much of Noth's detailed reconstruction of the Pentateuchal traditions was obtained by piling one speculation upon another." (p.&amp;nbsp;20)

His critique of scholars such as [[Rolf Rendtorff]] and [[Erhard Blum]] (a student of Rendtorff), who worked after Noth but in the same form and tradition-critical school was even more trenchant. These scholars contributed to what is known as the [[Supplementary hypothesis]].

According to Whybray:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Rendtorff has merely replaced the comparatively simple Documentary Hypothesis which postulated only a small number of written sources and redactors with a bewildering multiplicity of sources and redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;21), while Blum's approach was, if anything, more complex and more dogmatic{{snd}} not to mention less demonstrable{{snd}} than Rendtorff's.&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"&gt;Gordon Wenham, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html#10 ''Pentateuchal Studies Today''], [[Themelios]] 22.1 (October 1996): 3–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whybray's own, alternative hypothesis, is based not on the documentary model but on a fragmentary model. He suggests that the Pentateuch was the product of a single author (not the four authors and multiple editors of the documentary hypothesis) working at some time in the 6th century BC "[with] a mass of material, most of which may have been of quite recent origin and had not necessarily formed part of any ancient Israelite tradition" (p.&amp;nbsp;242). Whybray saw this author as a national historian, aware of contemporary Greek history and writing in conscious imitation of Greek models, with the aim of extending the existing [[Deuteronomic history]] backwards in time to create a national history of the Israelites from the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="j1518470"/&gt;

== Assessment ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' has been described as "the most compelling critique of the hypothesis" ever made, and its arguments are frequently cited by evangelical Christians who wish to state the case for Mosaic authorship (although Whybray explicitly rejects this notion and states that he regards the Pentateuch as fiction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/bibs/DJACcurrres/Whybray.html "Making Waves Gently: The Contribution of Norman Whybray to British Old Testament Study"], University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Wenham]], for example, writing in 1996, "Whybray's work on the Pentateuch could be viewed as the logical conclusion of the direction in which most pentateuchal criticism has been moving in the last three decades. ... His book is a powerful and valid critique of the methods that have been taken for granted in Pentateuchal criticism for nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"/&gt;

Egyptologist and Bible scholar [[James K. Hoffmeier]] has affirmed that although Whybray offers the most comprehensive critique of the documentary hypothesis within recent critical scholarship, he concludes that Whybray's view doesn't actually advance pentateuchal studies but instead revives a late 18th, early 19th century theory held by Alexander Geddes and J.S. Vater.&lt;ref&gt;James Karl Hoffmeier.

'''The Marine Mammal Center''' is a private, non-profit [[United States|U.S.]] organization that was established in 1975 for the purpose of rescuing, rehabilitating, and releasing, marine mammals who are injured, ill, or abandoned. It was founded in Sausalito, California by Lloyd Smalley, Pat Arrigoni, and Paul Maxwell. Since 1975 they rescued over 20,000 marine mammals.  It also serves as a center for environmental research and education regarding [[marine mammals]], namely  [[cetaceans]] (whales and dolphins) and [[pinnipeds]] (seals, fur seals, and sea lions). Marine mammal abandonment refers to maternal separation; pups that have been separated from their mother before weaning. At the center, they receive specialized veterinary care; diagnosed, treated, rehabilitated, and ideally, released back into the wild. Animals in need of assistance are usually identified by a member of the public who has contacted the center. These animals represent the following major species: California sea lion, northern elephant seal, Pacific harbor seal, northern fur seal, and the southern sea otter. On a few occasions, the Marine Mammal Center has taken in Guadeloupe fur seals, Steller sea lions, and bottlenose/Pacific white-sided dolphins. The only non-mammals that the center takes in are sea turtles.

==Research==
The research team consists of veterinarians and biologists, who conduct not only medical diagnosis and intervention, but also publish scientific reports on marine animal health in relation to the [[Pacific Ocean]]’s [[environmental chemistry]]. They collaborate with other selected technology centers to provide vital information on disease, [[immunological]] systems and environment effects. Some patients are fitted with radio or satellite tags before release, to further specific research goals. The center collaborates with counterparts around the world (most notably from England, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, Scotland, the Netherlands, France, and Germany) in working on complex cases, and also jointly research interactions of [[ocean]]-dwelling mammals with the marine environment.

Researchers at the Marine Mammal Center have discovered that [[domoic acid]] (DA) is the causative agent responsible for illness in a great many California sea lions. DA is naturally produced by the [[diatom]] ''Pseudo-nitzschia''. DA passes up the food chain as the diatoms are consumed by zooplankton. These zooplankton are then consumed by fish where the toxin accumulates. Fish are unharmed by it. California sea lions are disproportionate affected because they feed closer to shore, where more of these diatoms are present. When consumed by (marine) mammals, it activates neural pathways in the brain, specifically, the hippocampus. This neural activation is unregulated and results in seizures. Repeated exposure will cause repeated activation, ultimately burning out these neural pathways and causing permanent brain damage; specifically, atrophy of the hippocampus. Domoic acid is the same biotoxin that causes [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]] in humans.

Another discovery by the Marine Mammal Center, in collaboration with the [[University of Florida]], is that [[seal pox]] is distinct from pox viruses isolated from other species. It is unrelated to [[chicken pox]] or [[smallpox]]. Also being investigated is the increased incidence of [[leptospirosis]], a bacterial pathogen that can acutely damage the kidneys of marine mammals.

The Marine Mammal Center has made advances in the use of general anesthesia on marine mammals, used during surgical procedures. To a certain extent, marine mammals are voluntary breathers. Pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, fur seals) can reduce their respiratory rate in order to conserve oxygen and remain underwater for extended periods. This makes the use of general anesthesia and tranquilizing darts more problematic.

Any animal that dies in treatment or is euthanized while at the center, will undergo a necropsy to further research. At the center, there is a viewing area where the public can observe the procedure. Animals are only euthanized if their illness or injury is beyond treatment and would lead to the animals death, or unabated suffering. Considering that animals in need are only identified when their distress is significant enough to be observable by the public, it is not unusual for some of these animals to be beyond rehabilitation.

==Education==
The education outreach program reaches in excess of 100,000 school children and adults each year, emphasizing human connection to the marine environment. In addition to the groups of children who visit the center, there is a 'Sea to School' that visits Bay Area Schools. The hope is that with a better understanding of the ocean and its inhabitants, communities will care for and respect the oceans.

==Rescue and rehabilitation==

The ultimate goal is for every animal rescued by The Marine Mammal Center to be released back to the ocean with a second chance at life.  Since 1975, the center has rescued over 20,000 marine mammals, mostly California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and Pacific harbor seals. The center can have upwards of 275 animals at the hospital at one time. In the spring time, the center rescues mostly young elephant seal and harbor seal pups that have been separated from their mothers due to either big storms or human interaction, or once weaned from their mother, were unable to find food on their own.  In the summer time, the center rescues mostly California sea lions that are approximately 1 year old that have struggled to find food on their own, or adults suffering from different diseases, such as domoic acid toxicosis, leptospirosis or cancer.  The center also rescues approximately 80–100 animals each year directly due to negative human interaction, such as entanglement in plastic or fishing gear, ingestion of trash, harassment on the beach and even gunshot wounds. At the center, volunteers and veterinarians provide round-the-clock care for the patients to help them recover, ranging from administering medication and food to patients, teaching young seals to catch and eat fish, and performing medical procedures like x-rays, surgeries and ultrasounds.

In almost all cases, the animals can be treated and returned to their ocean home.  In rare cases, less than 1% of the time, animals that are rescued may be deemed unreleasable. If an animal has been released on two occasions and returns both times, it may have become habituated with people and no longer capable of fending for itself. Some animals may have suffered injuries that have left them blind or otherwise disabled. Although their health is stable, they may no longer be able to survive independently in the wild. These too, are considered unreleasable. In these circumstances, the Marine Mammal Center works with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) to find a permanent home for the animal in an approved zoo or aquarium. In May, 2011, the [[San Francisco Zoo]] accepted two such animals, both are male California sea lions; named Silent Knight and Henry. Silent Knight was shot and blinded in Sausalito in December 2010. The cause of Henry's blindness is unknown. There was no external injury to the eyes and the cause may be neurological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/about-us/News-Room/2011-news-archives/silent-knight.html|title=The Marine Mammal Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities, budget and governance==
[[File:Marine Mammal Center - 02.jpg|thumb|Marine Mammal Center in the Marin Headlands]]
Facilities include the [[Marin Headlands]] headquarters and field stations in [[San Luis Obispo]], [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[Anchor Bay, California|Anchor Bay]] and [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]]. The center's animal rescue radius is along the Pacific Coast of California and comprises approximately 600 square miles, between San Luis Obispo and Mendocino.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web

'''If you find a marine mammal or sea turtle in distress within this area''', please notify the Marine Mammal Center, at (415) 289-7325 (from Mendocino to San Mateo), (831) 633-6298 (Monterey and Santa Cruz), or (805) 771-8300 (San Luis Obispo). Calls are answered 24 hours a day. Do not touch, or approach the animal. It is illegal to harass a marine mammal. Any contact may result in injury to yourself or further injury or stress to the animal.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marine Mammal Center facility is located at what was once part of a former Nike Missile site. From 1953 to 1979, the United States Army built and operated over 265 Nike missile batteries throughout the United States. The best preserved installation is in the Marin Headlands, known as SF88. It was intended to protect local civilian and military populations against attack by Soviet bomber aircraft. It was opened in 1954, equipped with Nike Ajax missiles and later converted to hold improved Nike Hercules missiles. The site was decommissioned in 1974. Portions of the site, including three Nike Hercules missiles can be visited through the GG National Park Service on limited days and hours.

The Marine Mammal Center opened in 1975, one year after the closure of the missile site. Underground silos now house the facility's water filtration system. A small structure nearby was once a guard house. The exterior remains unchanged but it is now part of the Harbor Seal Hospital and also holds a surgical suite. Neither the former silo, nor the former guard house are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/goga/nike-missile-site.htm|title=Nike Missile Site - Golden Gate National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Marine Mammal Center is entirely privately funded. In 2012, the yearly operating budget for the center was approximately $7,500,000. 81% of expenditures went directly to animal care, [[veterinary]] expense, and education programs. In 2012, 76% of the Marine Mammal Center's operating budget came from private donations and individual and family memberships.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Mammal Center 2012 Annual Report,http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/about-us/publications/annual-reports/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Marine Mammal Center presently has a paid staff of 45 individuals. Its operation is reliant on several hundred volunteers who are trained in rescue, release, animal care, and education.

The main facility in Sausalito can accommodate approximately 1,200 animals a year; although a typical year brings between 600-800 patient. In 2009, a lack of available fish related to the El Nino weather pattern brought 1,750 patients to the Marine Mammal Center, more than in any other year since it opened. 2012 marked the year with the highest percentage of survivability for all patients, species combined. In the spring of 2013, environmental conditions limited to Southern California resulted in a higher than normal number of sea lion strandings. During this period, the Marine Mammal Center has taken in the overflow, approximately 65 patients.

===Growth===
The Marine Mammal Center began in 1975 with bath tubs and small pools surrounded by a fence. In June, 2009 a multi-facility complex was opened to hold both the animals and the staff. It was built with recycled materials and utilizes sound boards made of sea weed. Donated solar panels provide approximately 20% of the facilities energy. Water, which was previously a major expense, is now filtered through an advanced sand bed and ozone system which allows a water recovery rate of 80%.

During the reconstruction, numerous outdoor pens with pools and haul-out surfaces were created; there are also special purpose facilities including a [[veterinary]] hospital, records room, food preparation and storage rooms and rescue equipment storage area. The hospital includes an [[operating room]], treatment areas, office and [[pharmaceutical]] storage. Some of the hospital functions include [[thoracic]] [[surgery]], [[gastrointestinal surgery]], and [[orthopedic]] surgery as well as routine examinations and blood sampling for patient diagnosis.

Some specific examples among the thousands of successful outcomes are:

'''Net entangled humpback whale'''. In December 2005, a large female [[humpback whale]] was rescued off of the [[Farallon Islands]], after she became entangled in [[crab]] pot lines on her migration, most likely to wintering grounds near Mexico. The daring maneuver was carried out by center staff and volunteers along with professional divers and was the center's first successful open ocean rescue of a whale entangled in netting.

'''Orphaned Steller sea lion pup''' at [[Ano Nuevo Island]]. In 1999, a malnourished 37&amp;nbsp;lbs.(17&amp;nbsp;kg) pup was found stranded alone at a location known as a northern elephant seal rookery but not as a birthing location for [[Steller sea lions]]. The pup, named Artemis, was restored to health and returned to the wild.  In July 2005, she was again spotted on [[Ano Nuevo Island]], but this time she was giving birth to a new pup. This was a particularly unusual outcome, since no pup is known to have been born on that island for at least twenty years.

'''Humphrey the whale''' is arguably the most widely publicized [[humpback whale]] in history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; having errantly entered [[San Francisco Bay]] twice, departing from his [[Mexico]] to [[Alaska]] migration. Each excursion resulted in dramatic [[estuary|estuarine]] rescues in 1985 and 1990 by the center, assisted by the [[United States Coast Guard]] and hundreds of volunteers. The first rescue was actually to turn [[Humphrey the whale|Humphrey]] around in the [[Sacramento River]], while the second was to move him back into the water from the [[bay mud|mudflats]] north of Sierra Point below the [[Dakin Building]].

'''Baker D.''', a [[bottlenose dolphin]] was successfully rehabilitated and released to join a dolphin pod in Monterey Bay in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/pdfs/Bottlenosedolphinpressrelease2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208203634/http://marinemammalcenter.org/pdfs/Bottlenosedolphinpressrelease2004.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Sergeant Nevis"'''

On December 5, 2009, a 650&amp;nbsp;lbs., adult, male California sea lion was rescued from Knight's Landing in Yolo County, Northern California. Sgt. Nevis had suffered a shotgun wound to his sinuses. He was named after Yolo County police officer Michael Nevis, who assisted with his rescue. Imaging tests revealed that this had not been Sgt. Nevis' first run-in with a shotgun. Buckshot pellets remaining in his head evidenced that he had been shot several times previously. After months of treatment and rehabilitation, it was determined that he could not survive if returned to the ocean. In association with NOAA, he was transferred to permanent residence at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California.

The US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and later amendments, make it a federal crime to hunt, kill, capture, and/or harass any marine mammal. State laws and local ordinances may provide additional restrictions and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/laws/mmpa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2010, Sgt. Nevis had major reconstructive surgery to close the opening in his face created by the entry and exit of the shotgun slug. The complicated surgery was needed to cover the crater-like wound under his eyes. The injury had forced Sgt. Nevis to modify his breathing. He was unable to dive or even submerge his head under water. There was also a continuing risk of infection. Facial reconstruction surgeon Dr. Praful Ramenini donated his services for this delicate surgery. Dr. Ramenini was supported by center veterinarians Dr. Bill Van Bonn and Dr. Vanessa Fravel, as well as veterinarians Dr. Diana Procter and Dr. Nancy Anderson from Six Flags 
Discovery Kingdom.

On October 15, 2010, the Sutter County District Attorney's Office announced the successful criminal prosecution of a fisherman, for the shooting of Sgt. Nevis. He was convicted of intentionally maiming or wounding a living animal in violation of California Penal Code Section 597.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anapsid.org/pettrade/penalcode.html|title=California Penal Code: Animal Welfare Provisions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, five years of probation, and ordered to pay restitution of $51,081.48 to the Marine Mammal Center, toward the expenses of treating Sgt. Nevis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/about-us/News-Room/2010-news-archives/sgt-nevis-the-sea-lion.html|title=The Marine Mammal Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movie Trivia'''

In Peter Jackson's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, elephant seal and sea lion vocalizations were recorded at the Marine Mammal Center and used as the main component for the sound of the Orcs (northern elephant seals) and the Uruks (CA sea lions). Sound Designer David Farmer had coincidentally visited the center during elephant seal pupping season and was suitably impressed.&lt;ref&gt;Isaza, Miguel, Designing Sound, ''''David Farmer Special: The Lord of the Rings Exclusive Interview, September 30, 2010, http://designingsound.org/2010/09/david-farmer-special-the-lord-of-the-rings-exclusive-interview/, accessed 12-24-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IMDB (International Movie Data Base)&lt;Lord of the Rings - entry, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/trivia?tab=tr&amp;item=tr1644361, accessed 12-24-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transilvania University of Brașov''' ({{lang-ro|Universitatea Transilvania din Brașov}}; '''UniTBv''') is a public institution of higher education in [[Brașov]], [[Romania]], founded in 1971. It has eighteen faculties, a total of over 19,000 students, and more than 700 academic staff. The University offers 105 days license areas, 12 areas for distance education, and 5 areas for higher reduced frequency, as well as 73 graduate programs and 18 doctoral programs.

==History==
University level education came to be and evolved through the city of Brașov's strong cultural tradition and climate. Early notable cultural nuclei include the [[First Romanian School]], the first printing press (introduced by Deacon Coresi), the [[Johannes Honterus]] High School, the activity centered on the newspaper '[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]' (founded by [[George Baritiu|George Barițiu]]), and many others.

The first higher education school in Brașov was founded in 1940 in the form of the 'Academy of Commercial and Industrial Studies', followed by the 'Institute of Forestry' and the 'Institute of Mechanics' in 1948 and 49 respectively. Following 1953, these merge into the 'Polytechnic Institute of Brașov', while 1960 sees the establishment of another institute, with departments of [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]], followed by the founding of a department of Music in 1969.

In 1971 the 'University of Brașov' is founded by the merger of all higher education institutes through the [[Romanian Communist Party|Council of Ministers]]' Decision no. 1285/15 October. There were eight departments at the time: Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]], Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of [[Forestry]], Faculty of Wood Industry, Faculty of Mathematics and [[Computer Science]], Faculty of [[Physics]]–[[Chemistry]], Faculty of Natural and [[Agricultural Science]] and the Faculty of Music.

Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the university changed its name to that of today, the '"Transilvania" University of Brașov'.

Since then, a number of other departments have been set up: [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Economics]] (both in 1990), [[Medicine]] (1991), [[Psychology]] &amp; [[Methodology]] (1995). In 1995, the Faculty of Manufacturing Engineering was split into the Faculty of Technologic Engineering and the Faculty of the Science and Engineering of Materials. Two colleges were also founded that year, that of Forestry and that of 'Economics and Computer Science'.

In 2001, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering expanded its array of specializations; thus it had its name changed to the 'Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'.

In 2008 Transilvania University celebrated 60 years of existence, crowned with a spot at the top of the Romanian academic space.

Starting with the academic year 2005-2006, courses are organized to correspond with the [[Bologna Process]].

==Ranking==
According to the [[Scimago Lab]], based on data collected between 2007 and 2011, Transilvania University of Brașov ranked 1710 in the World, 113 regionally and 11 in the country by publication output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scimagoir.com/ Scimago Institutions Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The National Forestry and Wood-Technology University of Ukraine''' is a Ukrainian University in Lviv.

''Post address'': 103 Gen. Chuprynka St., 79057 Lviv, Ukraine

==History==
'''Austro-Hungarian period'''

Establishing of forestry education in western Ukraine had a long prehistory. In 1807, Galychian foresters appealed to the Government   with a request  to open a secondary forestry educational  establishment. In 1812, the project of creation of a department and professional studios at Lviv University was submitted for consideration. In 1852, a Forestry Section began to operate at the Galychina Economic Society, and soon in 1874 the Galychina Forestry Society appeared. On October 24, 1874 the Regional School of Forestry began training of specialists in Lviv. In 1908, the Regional School of Forestry was given a status of a higher educational establishment.

'''Period of [[Poland]]'s rule'''

Reorganization of educational establishments took place after the defeat of the Western-Ukrainian People Republic in Polish domination times. Higher Forestry School was joined with the Agrarian Academy and Agrarian-Forestry Faculty of Lviv Polytechnic University was established. In 1921-1926, Ukrainian underground University with Forestry (later on Forestry-Agrarian) Faculty within its structure operated in Lviv.

'''Period of [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation'''

In 1941-1944 only professional forestry courses on the basis of  Lviv Polytechnic University functioned.

'''Period of the [[USSR]]'''

On 15 January 1945, a Resolution of the USSR Government concerning foundation of Lviv Forestry Institute was adopted. On 6 November 1954, Forestry-Melioration Faculty of Lviv Agrarian Institute was joined with Forestry Faculty of the Forestry University. 
In 1988, Lviv Forestry Institute was named after the prominent scientist, academician Petro S. Pohrebnyak .

'''Independent [[Ukraine]]'''

On 17 June 1993, Forestry Institute was successfully accredited, it received  a State license for educational activity at the fourth educational-qualifying level. By the resolution of Ukraine's Cabinet of  13 August 1993, No. 646, the Ukrainian State Forestry University was founded on the basis of Petro Pohrebnyak Lviv Forestry Institute. On 16 May 2005, the University was given a status "National".

== Design ==
The reactor used highly [[enriched uranium]] metal fuel clad in aluminium. The fuel elements consisted of bundles of flat plates rather than rods. The core was cooled by light water.

The fuel elements were situated within six open-topped aluminium tanks containing water that were separated and surrounded by graphite. This meant that moderation was part by the water within the tanks and part by graphite - with graphite serving as the reflector.

Reactivity control was provided by four semaphore signal–type control blades held by magnetic clutches to shafts that could be driven by geared electric motors. The blades were made of cadmium plates rivetted to aluminium blades. The insertion of a single blade was sufficient to shut down the fission chain reaction.

The simple control system did not use voting logic. Any detected fault resulted in an immediate scram. Power failure also produced an immediate scram as the magnetic clutches on the control blades would disengage, certain control instrumentation had battery back up support.

The heat generated by fission was carried away by the cooling water and disposed of outside the facility by means of a forced-draft cooling radiator. Due to the small size of the core and low burn up of the fuel, the disposal of fission product heating was not an issue.

The concrete shielding was penetrated by a number of holes enabling neutron beams to be obtained for the purpose of irradiating samples and several pipes that enabled samples in sample carriers to be inserted into the reactor and subsequently removed to the adjoining radiochemical laboratory for study.

== Operations ==
The construction works started in 1962 and went critical on 7 July 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Razey|first=M.|date=1964|title=The Universities Research Reactor|url=https://www.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1049%2Fep.1964.0359|journal=Electronics and Power|volume=10|issue=10|pages=372|doi=10.1049/ep.1964.0359|issn=0013-5127}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In later years the reactor was rated at 300&amp;nbsp;kW thermal however originally the output was 100&amp;nbsp;kW thermal.

A study was undertaken (around 1980) to investigate increasing the power to 1 MW thermal; however, this was deemed to be too difficult and the plans were abandoned.

== Decommissioning ==
Decommissioning work began in 1992 and was finished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E.|first=HUMPHREYS|last2=K.|first2=RIDING|date=1994|title=Stages 1&amp;2 Decommissioning of the Universities Research Reactor(URR), Risley|url=|journal=Nuclear Engineer|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=154-157|issn=0262-5091|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor fuel been [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]].

'''Vacuum engineering''' deals with technological processes and equipment that use [[vacuum]] to achieve better results than those run under atmospheric [[pressure]]. The most widespread applications of vacuum technology are:
* [[Pyrolytic chromium carbide coating]]
* [[Antireflecting]] glass
* [[Glass colouring]]
* [[Vacuum impregnation]]
* [[Vacuum coating]]
* [[Vacuum drying]]

[[Vacuum coaters]] are capable of applying various types of coatings on [[metal]], [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[ceramic]] surfaces, providing high quality and uniform thickness and color. [[Vacuum dryers]] can be used for delicate materials and save significant quantities of energy due to lower drying temperatures.

==Design and mechanism==
Vacuum systems usually consist of gauges, vapor jet and pumps, vapor traps and valves along with other extensional piping’s.  A vessel that is operating under vacuum system may be any of these types such as processing tank, steam simulator, particle accelerator, or any other type of space that has an enclosed chamber to maintain the system in less than atmospheric gas pressure.  Since a [[vacuum]] is created in an enclosed chamber, the consideration of being able to withstand external [[atmospheric pressure]] are the usual precaution for this type of design.  Along with the effect of buckling or collapsing, the outer shell of vacuum chamber will be carefully evaluated and any sign of deterioration will be corrected by the increase of thickness of the shell itself.The main material used for vacuum design are usually mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.Other sections such as glass are used for gauge glass or view ports or sometimes electrical insulation. The interior of [[vacuum chamber]] should always be smooth and free of rush and defections.
High pressure solvent are usually used to remove any excess oil and contaminants that will affect vacuum in any way.Due to [[vacuum chamber]] is in an enclosed space, very specific detergents can be used to prevent any hazards or danger during cleaning. Any [[vacuum chamber]] should always have a certain number of access and viewing ports.  These are usually served as a flange connection to the attachment of pumps, piping or any other parts required for system operation.  The most importance is the fabrication of vacuum chambers sealing capability.The chamber itself must be airtight to maintain perfect vacuum, this is ensure through the process of leaking hunting generally using mass [[spectrometer]] leak detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Science and Engineering|last=Atta|first=C.M. Van|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All openings and connections are also assembled with O rings and gaskets to prevent any further possible leakage of air in the system.

==Technology==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2017}}
Vacuum engineering uses techniques and equipment that vary greatly depending on the level of vacuum used. Pressure slightly reduced from atmospheric pressure may be used to control airflow in ventilation systems, or in material handling systems. Lower-pressure vacuums may be used in vacuum evaporation in processing of food stuffs without excessive heating. Higher grades of vacuum are used for degassing, vacuum metallurgy, and in the production of light bulbs and cathode ray tubes. So-called "ultrahigh" vacuums are required for certain semiconductor processing; the "hardest" vacuums with the lowest pressure are produced for experiments in physics, where even a few stray atoms of air would interfere with the experiment in progress.

Apparatus used varies with decreasing pressure. Blowers give way to various kinds of reciprocating and rotary pumps. For some important applications, a [[steam ejector]] can quickly evacuate a large process vessel to a rough vacuum, sufficient for some processes or as a preliminary to more complete pumping processes. The invention of the [[Sprengel pump]] was a critical step in the development of the incandescent light bulb as it allowed creation of a vacuum that was higher than previously available, which extended the life of the bulbs. At higher vacuum levels (lower pressures), diffusion pumps, absorption, cyrogenic pumps are used. Pumps are more like "compressors" since they gather the rarefied gases in the vacuum vessel and push them into a much higher pressure, smaller volume, exhaust. A chain of two or more different kinds of vacuum pumps may be used in a vacuum system, with one "roughing" pump removing most of the mass of air from the system, and the additional stages handling relatively smaller amounts of air at lower and lower pressures. In some applications, a chemical element is used to combine with the air remaining in an enclosure after pumping. For example, in electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, a metallic "getter" was heated by induction to remove the air left after initial pump down and closure of the tubes. The "getter" would also slowly remove any gas evolved within the tube during its remaining life, maintaining sufficiently good vacuum.

==Applications==
Vacuum technology is a method used to evacuate air from a closed volume by creating a pressure differential from the closed volume to some vent, the ultimate vent being the open atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|last=|first=|publisher=Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using an industrial vacuum system, a vacuum pump or generator creates this pressure differential. A variety of technical inventions were created based on the idea of vacuum discovered during the 17th century. These range from vacuum generation pumps to X-ray tubes, which were later introduced to the medical field for use as sources of [[X-ray | X-ray radiation]]. The vacuum environment has come to play an important role in scientific research as new discoveries are being made by looking back to the basic fundamentals of pressure. The idea of “perfect vacuum” cannot be realized, but very nearly approximated by the technological discoveries of the early 20th century. Vacuum engineering today uses a range of different material, from aluminum to zirconium and just about everything in between. There may be the popular belief that vacuum technology deals only with valves, flanges, and other vacuum components, but novel scientific discoveries are often made with the assistance of these traditional vacuum technologies, especially in the realm of high-tech. Vacuum engineering is used for [[List of semiconductor materials#Compound semiconductors|compound semiconductors]], power devices, memory logic, and [[photovoltaics]].

Another technical invention is the vacuum pump. Such invention is used to remove gas molecules from sealed volume thus leaving behind a partial vacuum. More than one vacuum pumps are used in a single application to create fluent flow. Fluent flow is used to allow a clear path made using vacuum to remove any air molecules in the way of the process. Vacuum will be used in this process to attempted to create a perfect vacuum. A type of vacuum such as partial vacuum can be caused by the usage of [[positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] type pumps. A positive displacement pump is able to transfer gas load from the entrance to the exit port, but due to its limitation of design it can only achieve a relatively low vacuum. In order to reach a higher vacuum, other techniques must be used. By using a series of pump such as following up a fast pump down with a positive displacement type pump will create a way better vacuum than using a single pump. These combination of pump used is usually determined by the need of vacuum in the system.

[[Materials for use in vacuum]] systems must be carefully evaluated. Many materials have a degree of porosity, unimportant at ordinary pressures, but which would continually admit minute amounts of air into a vacuum system if incorrectly used. Some items, such as rubber and plastic, [[outgassing|give off gases into a vacuum]] that can contaminate the system. At high and ultrahigh vacuum levels, even metals must be carefully selected - air molecules and moisture can cling to the surface of metals, and any trapped gas within the metal may percolate to the surface under vacuum. In some vacuum systems, a simple coating of low-volatile grease is sufficient to seal gaps in joints, but at ultrahigh vacuum, fittings must be carefully machined and polished to minimize trapped gas. It is usual practice to bake components of a high-vacuum system; at high temperatures, any gases or moisture adhering to the surface is driven off. However, this requirement affects which materials can be used.

[[Particle accelerator]]s are the largest ultrahigh vacuum systems and can be up to kilometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jousten (ed),C. Benjamin Nakhosteen (transl.),  ''Handbook of Vacuum Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2016 {{ISBN|3527688242}}, chapters 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word “Vacuum” is originated from the Latin word “vacua”, which is translated to the word “empty”.Physicist use vacuum to describe a partially empty space, where air or some other  gases are being removed from one container. The idea of vacuum relating to the empty space has been speculated as early as 5th century from Greek philosophers, [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the one who came up with the relation of vacuum being an empty space in nature would be impossible to ever create.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7018/85d89b6a00275ba0cb627f54b5db326011f4.pdf .]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had stuck around for over centuries until the 17th century, when vacuum technology and physics was discovered. In the mid 17th century, [[Evangelista Torricelli]] studied the properties of a vacuum generated by a mercury column in a glass tube; this became the [[barometer]], an instrument to observe variations in atmospheric air pressure.  [[Otto von Guericke]] spectacularly demonstrated the effect of atmospheric pressure in 1654, when teams of horses could not separate two 20-inch diameter hemispheres, which had been placed together and evacuated. In 1698, [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam pump that relied on condensation of steam to produce a low-grade vacuum, for pumping water out of mines. The apparatus was improved in the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] of 1712; while inefficient, it allowed coal mines to be exploited that otherwise would flood by ground water. During the years of 1564-1642, the famous scientist [[Galileo]] was one of the first physicist to conduct experiments to develop measured forces to develop vacuum using a piston in a cylinder.This was a big discovery for scientist and was shared among others. French scientist and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] used the idea that was discovered to look into further research of vacuum. Pascal discoveries were similar to Torricelli’s research as Pascal used similar methods to pull vacuum using mercury. It was until the year 1661, when the mayor of the city of [[Magdeburg]] used this discovery to invent or retrofit new ideas. The mayor Otto von Guericke created the first air pump, modified the idea of water pumps, and also modified manometers.Vacuum engineering today, provides the solution for all thin film needs in the mechanical industry. This method of engineering is typically used for R&amp;D needs or large scale material production.

[[Atmospheric railway|Vacuum was used to propel trains]] experimentally.

Pump technology hit a plateau until [[Heinrich Geissler|Geissler]]  and [[Sprengel pump|Sprengle]] in the mid 19th century, who finally gave access to the high-vacuum regime. This led to the study of electrical discharges in vacuum, discovery of cathode rays,discovery of X-rays and the discovery of the electron. The photoelectric effect was observed in high vacuum, which was a key discovery that lead to the formulation of quantum mechanics and much of modern physics.

'''Washington College''' is a private, independent [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]. Maryland granted Washington College its charter in 1782. [[George Washington]] supported the founding of the college by consenting to have the "College at Chester" named in his honor, through generous financial support, and through service on the college's Board of Visitors and Governors. Washington College is the [[Colonial Colleges|10th-oldest college]] in the [[United States]] and was the first college chartered after American independence. The school became [[coeducational]] in 1891.

==History==
[[File:Bronze GW Statue.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze George Washington statue overlooks the campus green.]]
Washington College evolved from the Kent County Free School, an institution of more than 60 years' standing in "Chester Town," which by the college's founding date of 1782 had reached considerable strength and importance as a port city. [[George Washington]] consented to the fledgling college's use of his name, pledged the sum of 50 guineas to its establishment, and extended his warm wishes for the "lasting and extensive usefulness" of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Washington]] to William Smith, August 18, 1782. George Washington Papers, Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; He later served on Washington College's Board of Visitors and Governors — his only such involvement with an institution of higher learning.

The college's first president, the Reverend [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]], was a prominent figure in colonial affairs of letters and church, and he had a wide acquaintance among the great men of colonial days, including [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Joining General Washington on the Board of Visitors and Governors of the new college were such distinguished figures as U.S. Senator [[John Henry (Maryland)|John Henry]], Congressman [[Joshua Seney]] and his Excellency [[William Paca]], Governor of Maryland. The Maryland legislature granted its first college charter upon Washington College in May 1782.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519054204/http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html |date=May 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following spring, on May 14, 1783, the college held its first commencement.

President Smith had envisaged Washington College as the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] Campus of a public University of Maryland with [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] as its [[Western Shore]] counterpart, a proposal incorporated into the later institution's 1784 state charter, but the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland General Assembly's]] reluctance to provide funding meant this was never more than a paper institution and the relationship ended with Smith's return to Philadelphia in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilghman|first1=Tench Francis|title=The Early History of St. John's College in Annapolis|date=1984|publisher=St. John's College Press|location=Annapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his election as first President of the United States, General Washington retired from the Board of Visitors and Governors and accepted the honorary degree of doctor of laws, which a delegation from Chestertown presented to him on June 24, 1789, in New York, then the seat of Congress. Since Washington's last visit to campus, Washington College has hosted five U.S. presidents: [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Harry S Truman]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

The original college building cornerstone was laid in May 1783, it opened in 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a basement fire January 11, 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743-1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 on the site of the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register Listings in Maryland|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2011-2012 academic year, 56.6% of applicants were accepted to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington College, Applying|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/washington-college|publisher=The College Board|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,400 [[undergraduate]]s and 100 [[graduate student]]s attend Washington College, 47 percent from Maryland and the balance from 35 [[U.S. state|other states]] and forty foreign nations. Approximately 8 percent of the American undergraduates are [[minority group|minority]] students and approximately 8 percent are international citizens. Approximately 5 percent of the college's student body is "non-traditional" (25 years old or older).  Approximately 80 percent of all students live in college residence halls; the rest commute either from off-campus housing or from home.

[[Tuition]] for the 2012-2013 year is $39,208 and total expenses per annum (including room, board, and fees) are $48,768.  Approximately 85 percent of the student body receives some form of need-based financial aid or merit-based [[scholarship]] award.

===Traditions===

'''George Washington Birthday Ball''': A college-wide dance where students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends of the college come together to celebrate George Washington's birthday. The event usually takes place on, or around, the actual date of George Washington's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birthdayball.washcoll.edu/ |title=Washington College &amp;#124; News and Events |publisher=Birthdayball.washcoll.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War on the Shore''': The annual men's lacrosse game, held in late spring between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]], two of Maryland's Eastern Shore's undergraduate schools.  Beginning in 2004, the winner of the game has been awarded the Charles B. Clark Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoncollegesports.com/mlacrosse/releases/04cup.html |title=Washington College Men's Lacrosse |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[May Day (Washington College)|May Day]]''': Started in 1968 by Professor Bennett Lamond of the English Department, who retired in 2004. He brought a class out onto the green, where they read poetry and drank wine. Later that night some of the students returned, and Washington College's May Day celebration was born. Since then, May Day has become a two-day festival on April 30 and May 1, often involving public nudity by some of the student body. The event draws many students as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjjBgtvrQNY |title=Video Interview with Bennett Lamond |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==

===Varsity sports===
[[File:WashingtonCollegeWar.On.The.Shore.jpg|thumb|The annual lacrosse rivalry between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]] is known as '''The War on the Shore'''.]]

Washington College has competed in intercollegiate athletics since the 19th century.  Its oldest current varsity sports are the baseball team, which dates back to at least the early 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/bsb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the men's basketball team, which plays its 100th season in 2011-12.&lt;ref name="washingtoncollegesports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/mbkb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's teams are known as the Shoremen; women's teams are known as the Shorewomen.

While men have been playing varsity sports at Washington College for well over a century, varsity opportunities for women have been a more recent development. The first varsity sports for women&amp;nbsp;– rowing, tennis, and volleyball&amp;nbsp;– were added in the mid-1970s and were followed by the additions of softball, lacrosse, field hockey, and swimming by the mid-1980s. Varsity women's basketball began play during the 1993-94 season, while co-ed sailing was elevated to varsity status four years later. The women's soccer team is the college's newest varsity sport; it began play during the fall of 1998.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Washington College fielded a varsity football team through 1950, a men's track and field team through 1982, and a men's cross country team through 1989. The college previously sponsored varsity men's golf and varsity wrestling.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

14 of Washington College's 17 varsity teams compete in the [[Centennial Conference]]. The men's and women's rowing teams compete in the [[College rowing (United States)#Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference|Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference]] (MARC), while the sailing team competes in the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]] (MAISA), a part of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rowing and sailing teams host regattas on the Chester River and call the college's Truslow Boat House and Lelia Hynson Boating Park home.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The college's 17 varsity teams are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Middle, East and West Halls''' stand on the crest of a low hill (the terrace) at the center of campus. Middle Hall (built 1844) and East and West Halls (built 1854) hold a special place in the history of Washington College, as they are the oldest surviving campus buildings.  They serve as monuments to the original Common Building (completed in 1789), whose site they occupy.  They are all three-story buildings constructed of brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-05|work= National Register of Historic Places: Middle, East and West Halls|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="nris" /&gt;

They now function as follows:
*East Hall&amp;nbsp;– The International House is a three-floor coed building that serves as a home for students interested in international relation and foreign language study. This theme house has a faculty advisor.
*Middle Hall&amp;nbsp;– The Creative Arts House is a coed building for students interested in drama, music, visual art, literature, and the creative arts in general.

'''Weapon systems engineering''' involves using engineering tools in [[technology]] to create and guarantee the safety and performance of weapons. It is currently being used by the [[military]] and the government to create new weapons to protect the [[United States]]. It is used to make nuclear and non-[[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and ensure their safety throughout their lifespan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/defenseprograms/futurescienceandtechnologyprograms/engineering|title=Engineering|website=NNSA|accessdate=February 15th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies Involved ==
Many companies help our government and military to manufacture new weapons and strategies. One is Parsons. The [[Missile Defense Agency]], MDA, is a research agency that develops and tests the missile defense agency to defend the United States and its allies. Parsons helps with this through the MDA [[missile]] contract. They provide missile system support including tests and evaluating the performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parsons.com/project/weapons-missile-systems-engineering/|title=Weapons and Missile Systems Engineering – Various U.S. Locations - Parsons|work=Parsons|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] awarded multi-million-dollar contracts with Tekla Research and Avian-Precise Co. to support the "[[Naval Air Systems Command|Naval Air Systems]] Command's Systems Engineering Department". Tekla is to help NAVAIR assess [[technology]], cost, and design. Avian-Precise is to help the command sustain a weapons system related to all U.S. naval platforms and systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/2018/02/navy-selects-tekla-research-avian-precise-co-for-navair-systems-engineering-support-idiqs/|title=Navy Selects Tekla Research, Avian-Precise Co. for NAVAIR Systems Engineering Support IDIQs|work=ExecutiveBiz|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventions ==
The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a new long-range weapon using electricity instead of chemicals to launch projectiles. [[Projectile|Projectiles]] can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate [[Explosive material|explosives]] where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://science.dodlive.mil/2015/02/13/the-future-moves-at-mach-6/|title=The Future Moves at Mach 6|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a "low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles" and a "nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/02/02/the-us-could-be-getting-2-new-nuclear-capabilities-here-are-the-details/|title=The US could be getting 2 new nuclear capabilities.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a [[Humvee]] to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another [[soldier]] or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/army-wingman-autonomous-vehicle-program/|title=The Army Is Finally Engineering A Wingman Who Won’t Screw Soldiers Over|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=2018-02-14|work=Task &amp; Purpose|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics. The Army is not looking to make killing machines, but machines controlled by humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.meritalk.com/articles/army-ready-to-certify-armed-robotic-wingman-vehicles-for-combat/|title=Army Ready to Certify Armed, Robotic ‘Wingman’ Vehicles for Combat – MeriTalk|website=www.meritalk.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] Research Lab (AFRL) assigned [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martain]] the job of creating "an aircraft-mounted high-power fibre laser". They must make a weapon that is small enough and light enough, but also can be effective. The laser will be mounted on jet fighters with the ability to disable enemies targeting systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/agents-shield-us-air-forces-new-aircraft-mounted-laser-weapon/|title=Agents of SHiELD – the US Air Force’s new aircraft-mounted laser weapon - Airforce Technology|date=2018-02-19|work=Airforce Technology|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Zoomorphic representation in religion===
*The appearance of the [[Holy Spirit]] like a [[dove]] in the [[New Testament]] (The Gospel According to Luke 3: 22), "and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove..."  
*[[Mark the Evangelist]] as a [[lion]] in later Christian [[iconography]]. 
* The [[netjer|Egyptian gods]] were often depicted as zoomorphic or as [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]]
* The names of the two most prominent Hebrew Bible female prophets - Deborah and Huldah - were in the Babylonian Talmud interpreted in zoomorphic terms as "wasp" and "weasel."&lt;ref&gt;Blaženka Scheuer;  Animal Names for Hebrew Bible Female Prophets, ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 31, Issue 4, 1 December 2017, Pages 455–471, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/litthe/frx032&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoomorphic language for things, ideas===
*A literary phrase such as "The roar of the ocean".
*[[Christian views of sin|Sin]] lurking like a beast waiting to devour [[Cain]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis: bulletin du Comité national de littérature comparée / Comitetul Național pentru Literatură Comparată, Institutul de Istorie și Teorie Literară "G. Călinescu." - 2002 "Sin is personified as (an animal?) which "crouches" at the door of Cain (Gen 4:7). As [[Gerhard von Rad]] (Genesis, 105) remarks, 'The comparison of sin with a beast of prey lying before the door is strange, as is the purely decorative use "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanity portrayed in evolutionary context===

[[Desmond Morris]] in [[The Naked Ape]] and [[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]], [[Robert Ardrey]] in [[African Genesis]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] in [[On Aggression]] all wrote from a [[sociobiological]] perspective. They viewed the human species as an animal, subject to the evolutionary law of [[Survival of the fittest]] through adaptation to the [[biophysical environment]].&lt;ref&gt; [[William Ickes]], ''Compatible and Incompatible Relationships'', Springer Verlag, 1985, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
