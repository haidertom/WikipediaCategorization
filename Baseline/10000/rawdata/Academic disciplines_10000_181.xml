'''Abstract art''' uses a [[visual language]] of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking'', University of California Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the [[19th century]] many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [[technology]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [[image]]ry in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In [[geometric abstraction]], for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. [[Figurative art]] and total abstraction are almost [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. But figurative and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] (or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]]) art often contains partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and [[lyrical abstraction]] are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous [[art movements]] that embody partial abstraction would be for instance [[fauvism]] in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and [[cubism]], which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm |title=Abstract Art – What Is Abstract Art or Abstract Painting, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075052/http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art – Abstraction, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Nga.gov |date=2000-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstraction in early art and many cultures ==
{{Main article|Prehistoric art|Eastern art history}}

Much of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.&lt;ref&gt;György Kepes, ''Sign, Image and Symbol'', [[Studio Vista]], London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hyatt,"Meeting on the Moor", ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Autumn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One can enjoy the beauty of [[Chinese calligraphy]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]] without being able to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, 2013.

[[File:Immortal in Splashed Ink.jpg|thumb|left|''Immortal in splashed ink'', Liang Kai, China, 12th century]]
In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the [[Tang dynasty]] painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.&lt;ref&gt;Lippit, Y. (2012). "Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495". ''The Art Bulletin'', 94(1), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some [[Song Dynasty]] Paintings. The [[Chan Buddhism|Chan buddhist]] painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink"  in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to [[Tiantai|Tiantai buddhism]], created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by [[Sesshu Toyo]] in his later years.
[[File:Yujian ink Mercadodemontaña.jpg|thumb|right|''Mountain market, clearing Mist'', Yu Jian, China]]
Another instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhu_Derun_-_Primordial_Chaos_(painting_only).jpeg ''Cosmic Circle'']. On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass&lt;ref&gt;Watt, J. C. (2010). ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty''. Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the [[Daoism|Daoist]] metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.
In Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created [[Enso]], a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich, "The Early Medici as Patrons of Art" in ''[[Norm and Form]]'', pp. 35–57, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Balfe, ed. ''Paying the Piper: Causes and Consequences of Art Patronage'', Univ. of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[art movement]]s which contributed to the development of abstract art were [[Romanticism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An ''objective interest in what is seen'', can be discerned from the paintings of [[John Constable]], [[J M W Turner]], [[Camille Corot]] and from them to the Impressionists who continued the ''[[plein air]]'' painting of the [[Barbizon school]].
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|left|[[James McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'' (1874), [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the art critic [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned this painting. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html Whistler versus Ruskin, Princeton edu.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062046/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html |date=June 16, 2010 }} Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early intimations of a new art had been made by [[James McNeill Whistler]] who, in his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket]]'', (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.

[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to [[Impressionism]] and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[James Ensor]] drew influences principally from the work of the [[Post-Impressionists]] they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
[[Paul Cézanne]] had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Art'', Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into [[Cubism]] by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

[[File:Yellow Curtain.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'', 1915. With his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color and drawing Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction.]] Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe [[mysticism]] and early [[Modernism|modernist]] religious philosophy as expressed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky|Mme. Blavatsky]] had a profound impact on pioneer [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] artists like [[Hilma af Klint]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The mystical teaching of [[Georges Gurdjieff]] and [[P.D. Ouspensky]] also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of [[Piet Mondrian]] and his colleagues in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Mondrian---mysticism---ldquo-My-long-search-is-over-rdquo--4237 |title=Hilton Kramer, "Mondrian &amp; mysticism: My long search is over", ''New Criterion'', September 1995 |publisher=Newcriterion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{main article|Western painting|Fauvism|Cubism|}}

[[Post Impressionism]] as practiced by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] had an enormous impact on [[20th-century art]] and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of [[modern art]]. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in ''French Window at Collioure'' (1914), ''[[View of Notre-Dame]]'' (1914), and ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'' from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Although [[Cubism]] ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with [[Fauvism]], the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Man Ray]] and others taking the clue from [[Cubism]] were instrumental to the development of the movement called [[Dada]].

The Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] published the [[Manifesto of Futurism]] in 1909, which later inspired artists such as [[Carlo Carra]] in ''Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells'' and [[Umberto Boccioni]] ''Train in Motion'', 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with [[Cubism]], profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzolla, ''Futurism'', Thames and Hudson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1912 Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], where [[František Kupka]] exhibited the abstract painting ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors'') (1912), the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] named the work of several artists including [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912–1920–1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He defined it as, "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, ''Art in theory, 1900–2000'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0631227083}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=SWu4SB92fHMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Apollinaire+on+Art books.google.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of [[modernism]]. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and [[art manifesto|manifestos]] so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from ''The World Backwards'' gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: "[[David Burliuk]]'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second [[Russian avant-garde|Knave of Diamonds exhibition]], held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German [[Die Brücke]] group, while from Paris came work by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance. He went abroad in May and came back determined to rival the almanac ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' which had emerged from the printers while he was in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Susan P Compton, ''The World Backwards'', British museum Publications, London, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 to 1913 many experimental works in the search for this 'pure art' had been created by a number of artists: [[Francis Picabia]] painted ''Caoutchouc'', 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://francispicabia.org/?page_id=80 |title=Francis Picabia, Caoutchouc, 1909, MNAM, Paris |publisher=Francispicabia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spring'', 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=80658 |title=Museum of Modern Art, New York, Francis Picabia, ''The Spring'', 1912 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dances at the Spring''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=80659 |title=MoMA, New York, Francis Picabia, ''Dances at the Spring'', 1912 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Procession, Seville'', 1912;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=92380.0&amp;detail=none |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805095626/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=92380.0&amp;detail=none |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-05 |title=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC., Francis Picabia, The Procession, Seville, 1912 |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]] painted ''Untitled (First Abstract Watercolor)'', 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stan Rummel |url=http://faculty.txwes.edu/csmeller/Human-Prospect/ProData09/02WW1CulMatrix/WW1PICs/Kandinsky1866/Kand1910FrstAbstr444.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719021713/http://faculty.txwes.edu/csmeller/Human-Prospect/ProData09/02WW1CulMatrix/WW1PICs/Kandinsky1866/Kand1910FrstAbstr444.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-19 |title=Wassily Kandinsky, ''Untitled'' (First Abstract Watercolor), 1910 |publisher=Faculty.txwes.edu |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Improvisation 21A'', the ''Impression'' series, and ''Picture with a Circle'' (1911);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/images/content/New_York/press_room/presskits/kandinsky_presskit.pdf |title=The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum, Kandinsky Retrospective, Guggenheim Museum, New York, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718222119/http://www.guggenheim.org/images/content/New_York/press_room/presskits/kandinsky_presskit.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[František Kupka]] had painted the Orphist works, ''Discs of Newton'' (Study for ''Fugue in Two Colors''), 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51038.html |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art, Disks of Newton (Study for "Fugue in Two Colors") 1912 |publisher=Philamuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors''), 1912; [[Robert Delaunay]] painted a series entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'' and ''Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2'' (1912–13);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ens-futurisme2008/ENS-futurisme2008-10-orphisme.html |title=Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Robert Delaunay, ''Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2'' (1912–13) |language=fr |publisher=Centrepompidou.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907020700/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ens-futurisme2008/ENS-futurisme2008-10-orphisme.html |archivedate=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léopold Survage]] created ''Colored Rhythm'' (Study for the film), 1913;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A5735&amp;page_number=&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1 |title=Museum of Modern Art, New York, Léopold Survage, Colored Rhythm (Study for the film) 1913 |publisher=Moma.org |date=1914-07-15 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piet Mondrian]], painted ''Tableau No. 1'' and ''Composition No. 11'', 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmm.nl/collection-search.php?reload=1&amp;characteristic_type=Painting&amp;artist=Piet+Mondriaan+%281872+-+1944%29&amp;van=0&amp;tot=0&amp;submit.x=51&amp;submit.y=5 |title=Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Netherlands, Piet Mondrian, 1913 |publisher=Kmm.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185216/http://www.kmm.nl/collection-search.php?reload=1&amp;characteristic_type=Painting&amp;artist=Piet+Mondriaan+%281872+-+1944%29&amp;van=0&amp;tot=0&amp;submit.x=51&amp;submit.y=5 |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piet Mondrian]] was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, [[Neo-Plasticism]] was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group [[De Stijl]] intended to reshape the environment of the future.

== Music ==

As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], himself an amateur musician,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Allen. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgqp5-EqEw8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= Arnold Schoenberg's Journey]''. Harvard University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0674011015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991. In 1871 the family moved to Odessa, where the young Kandinsky attended the Gymnasium and learned to play the cello and piano.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color ''resounding in the soul.'' The idea had been put forward by [[Charles Baudelaire]], that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has ''The spiritual dimension'' and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The [[Theosophical Society]] popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that [[Piet Mondrian]], Wassily Kandinsky, [[Hilma af Klint]] and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in [[geometry]]: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

== Russian avant-garde ==

[[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1923, [[The Russian Museum]]]]

{{main article|Russian avant-garde|Futurism (art)|}}

Many of the abstract artists in Russia became [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. ''Art into life!'' was [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. [[Varvara Stepanova]] and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Anton Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]]. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the [[Bauhaus]]. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only [[socialist realism]] was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Gray, ''The Russian Experiment in Art, 1863–1922'', Thames and Hudson, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bauhaus ==

The [[Bauhaus]] at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Gropius et al., ''Bauhaus 1919–1928'' Herbert Bayer ed., Museum of Modern Art,publ. Charles T Banford,Boston,1959&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in England and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. Among the teachers were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Anni Albers]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the [[Nazi party]] gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of [[degenerate art]], 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of [[avant-garde]] art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

== Abstraction in Paris and London ==

[[File:DasUndbild.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Schwitters]], ''Das Undbild'', 1919, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]

During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of [[totalitarianism]]. [[Sophie Tauber]] and [[Jean Arp]] collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish [[Katarzyna Kobro]] applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group organized by [[Joaquin Torres-Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seuphor|first1=Michel|title=Geometric Abstraccion 1926-1949|date=1972|publisher=Dallas Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Michel Seuphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Seuphor, ''Abstract Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Criticized by [[Theo van Doesburg]] to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal ''Art Concret'' setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', p. 104, Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international ''Abstract and Concrete'' exhibition was organized by [[Nicolete Gray]] including work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]]. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the [[St. Ives group]] in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== America: mid-century ==
{{main article|Modernism|Late modernism|American Modernism|Surrealism|}}

[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|left|The above is a 1939–42 oil on canvas painting by Mondrian titled ''Composition No. 10''. Responding to it, fellow [[De Stijl]] artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 "Van Doesburg stated that the purpose of art was to imbue man with those positive spiritual qualities that were needed in order to overcome the dominance of the physical and create the conditions for putting an end to wars. In an enthusiastic essay on Wassily Kandinsky he had written about the dialogue between the artist and the viewer, and the role of art as 'the educator of our inner life, the educator of our hearts and minds'. Van Doesburg subsequently adopted the view that the spiritual in man is nurtured specifically by abstract art, which he later described as 'pure thought, which does not signify a concept derived from natural phenomena but which is contained in numbers, measures, relationships, and abstract lines'. In his response to Piet Mondrian's ''Composition 10'', Van Doesburg linked peace and the spiritual to a non-representational work of art, asserting that 'it produces a most spiritual impression…the impression of repose: the repose of the soul'."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, [[surrealism]], and [[dada]] were represented in New York: [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Bauhaus'', Studio Vista, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the [[Abstract expressionists]] and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]]. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers [[John D. Graham]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. [[Mark Rothko]], born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The [[action painting|expressionistic gesture]] and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Franz Kline]]. While during the 1940s [[Arshile Gorky]]'s and [[Willem de Kooning]]'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler]], ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970'', Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{main article|Abstract expressionism|Color field|Lyrical abstraction|Post-painterly abstraction|Sculpture|Minimal art|}}

[[Digital art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], neo-Dada, [[shaped canvas]] painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, ''Art as Object'' as seen in the [[Minimalist]] sculpture of [[Donald Judd]] and the paintings of [[Frank Stella]] are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Joan Mitchell]].

== Causation ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in [[industrial society]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, 'Asceticism Against Colour', in ''New Formations'' 55 (2005) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Jameson]] similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The social ''content'' of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical psychology#Post-Jungian approaches|Post-Jungians]] by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffé, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) pp. 288–89, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''algal bloom''' or '''algae bloom''' is a rapid increase or accumulation in the population of [[algae]] in freshwater or marine water systems, and is recognized by the discoloration in the water from their pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferris |first=Robert |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Why are there so many toxic algae blooms this year |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/26/why-are-there-so-many-toxic-algae-blooms-this-year.html |newspaper=[[CNBC]] |access-date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyanobacteria]] were mistaken for algae in the past, so cyanobacterial blooms are sometimes also called algal blooms. Blooms which can injure animals or the ecology are called "[[harmful algal blooms]]" (HAB), and can lead to fish die-offs, cities cutting off water to residents, or states having to close fisheries.

== Blooming ==
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|Algal blooms can present problems for [[ecosystem]]s and human society.]]
Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. For some species, algae can be considered to be blooming at concentrations reaching millions of cells per milliliter, while others form blooms of tens of thousands of cells per liter. The photosynthetic pigments in the algal cells determine the color of the algal bloom, and are thus often a greenish color, but they can also be a wide variety of other colors such as yellow, brown or red, depending on the species of algae and the type of pigments contained therein.

Bright green blooms in freshwater systems are frequently a result of [[cyanobacteria]] (colloquially known as "blue-green algae" as a result of their confusing taxonomical history) such as ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa|Microcystis]]''. Blooms may also consist of [[macroalgal]] (non-[[phytoplanktonic]]) species. These blooms are recognizable by large blades of algae that may wash up onto the shoreline.

Of particular note are the rare '''harmful algal blooms''' (HABs), which are algal bloom events involving toxic or otherwise harmful phytoplankton such as [[dinoflagellate]]s of the [[genus]] ''Alexandrium'' and ''Karenia'', or [[diatoms]] of the genus ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]''. Such blooms often take on a red or brown hue and are known colloquially as '''[[red tide]]s'''.

==Freshwater algal blooms==

Freshwater algal blooms are the result of an [[Nutrient pollution|excess of nutrients]], particularly some [[phosphate]]s.&lt;ref name="Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diersling|first=Nancy|title=Phytoplankton Blooms: The Basics|url=http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqpb.pdf|publisher=NOAA FKNMS|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lake Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hochanadel|first=Dave|title=Limited amount of total phosphorus actually feeds algae, study finds|url=http://www.lakescientist.com/2010/limited-amount-of-total-phosphorus-actually-feeds-algae-study-finds|publisher=Lake Scientist|accessdate=10 June 2012|date=10 December 2010|quote=[B]ioavailable phosphorus – phosphorus that can be utilized by plants and bacteria – is only a fraction of the total, according to Michael Brett, a UW engineering professor ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excess of nutrients may originate from fertilizers that are applied to land for agricultural or recreational purposes.

Presence of [[Residual Sodium Carbonate Index|residual sodium carbonate]] acts as catalyst for the algae to bloom by providing dissolved carbon dioxide for enhanced photosynthesis in the presence of nutrients.

When phosphates are introduced into water systems, higher concentrations cause increased growth of algae and plants. Algae tend to grow very quickly under high nutrient availability, but each algal is short-lived, and the result is a high concentration of dead organic matter which starts to decay. The decay process consumes dissolved oxygen in the water, resulting in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions. Without sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water, animals and plants may [[Dead zone (ecology)|die off]] in large numbers. Use of an [[Olszewski tube]] can help combat these problems with hypolimnetic withdrawal.

Blooms may be observed in [[freshwater aquarium]]s when fish are overfed and excess nutrients are not absorbed by plants. These are generally harmful for fish, and the situation can be corrected by changing the water in the tank and then reducing the amount of food given.

==Harmful algal blooms==
{{main|Harmful algal blooms}}

A ''harmful algal bloom'' (HAB) is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical damage to other organisms, or by other means. HABs are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events and have been associated with various types of [[shellfish poisoning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

===Background===
In the marine environment, single-celled, microscopic, plant-like organisms naturally occur in the well-lit surface layer of any body of water. These organisms, referred to as [[phytoplankton]] or microalgae, form the base of the food web upon which nearly all other marine organisms depend. Of the 5000+ species of marine phytoplankton that exist worldwide, about 2% are known to be harmful or toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landsberg |first=J.

Harmful algal blooms have been observed to cause adverse effects to a wide variety of aquatic organisms, most notably marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds and finfish. The impacts of HAB toxins on these groups can include harmful changes to their developmental, immunological, neurological, or reproductive capacities.  The most conspicuous effects of HABs on marine wildlife are large-scale mortality events associated with toxin-producing blooms. For example, a [[mass mortality event]] of 107 [[bottlenose dolphins]] occurred along the Florida panhandle in the spring of 2004 due to ingestion of contaminated [[menhaden]] with high levels of [[brevetoxin]].&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flewelling |first=L. J. |year=2005 |title=Red tides and marine mammal mortalities |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=435 |issue=7043 |pages=755–756 |doi=10.1038/nature435755a |pmid= 15944690|pmc=2659475 |display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2005Natur.435..755F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manatee mortalities have also been attributed to brevetoxin but unlike dolphins, the main toxin vector was endemic seagrass species (''Thalassia testudinum'') in which high concentrations of brevetoxins were detected and subsequently found as a main component of the stomach contents of manatees.&lt;ref name="Flewelling LJ 2005"/&gt;

Additional marine mammal species, like the highly endangered [[North Atlantic Right Whale]], have been exposed to neurotoxins by preying on highly contaminated [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"&gt;Durbin E ''et al'' (2002) North Atlantic right whale, ''Eubalaena glacialis'', exposed to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins via a zooplankton vector, ''Calanus finmarchicus''. Harmful Algae I, : 243-251 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With the summertime habitat of this species overlapping with seasonal blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate ''Alexandrium fundyense'', and subsequent copepod grazing, foraging right whales will ingest large concentrations of these contaminated [[copepods]].  Ingestion of such contaminated prey can affect respiratory capabilities, feeding behavior, and ultimately the reproductive condition of the population.&lt;ref name="Durbin E 2002"/&gt;

Immune system responses have been affected by brevetoxin exposure in another critically endangered species, the [[Loggerhead sea turtle]].  Brevetoxin exposure, via inhalation of aerosolized toxins and ingestion of contaminated prey, can have clinical signs of increased lethargy and muscle weakness in loggerhead sea turtles causing these animals to wash ashore in a decreased metabolic state with increases of immune system responses upon blood analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=C. J. |year=2010 |title=Effects of brevetoxin exposure on the immune system of loggerhead sea turtles |journal=Aquatic Toxicology |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=293–303 |doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2009.12.014 |pmid= 20060602|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of common harmful effects of HABs include:
#the production of neurotoxins which cause mass mortalities in fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals
#human illness or death via consumption of seafood contaminated by toxic algae&lt;ref&gt;

HABs occur in many regions of the world, and in the United States are recurring phenomena in multiple geographical regions.  The [[Gulf of Maine]] frequently experiences blooms of the [[dinoflagellate]] ''[[Alexandrium fundyense]]'', an organism that produces [[saxitoxin]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]].  The well-known "Florida red tide" that occurs in the Gulf of Mexico is a HAB caused by ''[[Karenia brevis]]'', another dinoflagellate which produces brevetoxin, the neurotoxin responsible for [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]]. California coastal waters also experience seasonal blooms of ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'', a [[diatom]] known to produce [[domoic acid]], the neurotoxin responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]]. Off the west coast of [[South Africa]], HABs caused by ''[[Alexandrium catanella]]'' occur every spring. These blooms of organisms cause severe disruptions in [[fishery|fisheries]] of these waters as the toxins in the phytoplankton cause filter-feeding [[shellfish]] in affected waters to become poisonous for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;

If the HAB event results in a high enough concentration of algae the water may become discoloured or murky, varying in colour from purple to almost pink, normally being red or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discolouration.

===Red tides===
[[File:Maré vermelha.JPG|thumb|A red tide]]
{{main|Red tide}}

''[[Red tide]]'' is a term often used synonymously with HABs in marine coastal areas; however, the term is misleading since algal blooms can widely vary in color, and growth of algae is unrelated to the [[tide]]s. The term ''algal bloom'' or ''harmful algal bloom'' has since replaced ''red tide'' as the appropriate description of this phenomenon.

===Causes of HABs===
It is unclear what causes HABs; their occurrence in some locations appears to be entirely natural,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=N. G. |last2=Lesoing |first2=M. |last3=Trainer |first3=V. L. |year=2000 |title=Environmental conditions associated with domoic acid in razor clams on the Washington coast |journal=J Shellfish Res |volume=19 |issue= |pages=1007–1015 |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in others they appear to be a result of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lam |first=C. W. Y. |last2=Ho |first2=K. C. |year=1989 |chapter=Red tides in Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong |editor-last=Okaichi |editor-first=T. |editor2-last=Anderson |editor2-first=D.

The frequency and severity of HABs in some parts of the world have been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities. In other areas, HABs are a predictable seasonal occurrence resulting from coastal upwelling, a natural result of the movement of certain ocean currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trainer |first=V. L. |last2=Adams |first2=N. G. |last3=Bill |first3=B. D. |last4=Stehr |first4=C. M. |last5=Wekell |first5=J. C. |last6=Moeller |first6=P. |last7=Busman |first7=M. |last8=Woodruff |first8=D. |year=2000 |title=Domoic acid production near California coastal upwelling zones, June 1998 |journal=Limnol Oceanogr |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=1818–1833 |doi= 10.4319/lo.2000.45.8.1818|pmid= |bibcode=2000LimOc..45.1818T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of marine phytoplankton (both non-toxic and toxic) is generally limited by the availability of nitrates and phosphates, which can be abundant in coastal upwelling zones as well as in agricultural run-off. The type of nitrates and phosphates available in the system are also a factor, since phytoplankton can grow at different rates depending on the relative abundance of these substances (e.g. [[ammonia]], [[urea]], nitrate ion). A variety of other nutrient sources can also play an important role in affecting algal bloom formation, including iron, silica or carbon.  Coastal [[water pollution]] produced by humans (including iron fertilization) and systematic increase in [[global warming|sea water temperature]] have also been suggested as possible contributing factors in HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=S. |year=2011 |title=Impacts of climate variability and future climate change on harmful algal blooms and human health |work=Proceedings of the Centers for Oceans and Human Health Investigators Meeting |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-S2-S4 |display-authors=etal |volume=7 |pages=S4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as iron-rich dust influx from large desert areas such as the [[Sahara]] are thought to play a role in causing HABs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |year=2006 |title=Red tides in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, when, and why? |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=111 |issue= |pages=C11003 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002813 |bibcode=2006JGRC..11111003W|display-authors=etal|pmc=2856968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some algal blooms on the [[Pacific coast]] have also been linked to natural occurrences of large-scale climatic oscillations such as [[El Niño]] events. HABs are also linked to heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name="Morse 1006–1025"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Ryan E.|last2=Shen|first2=Jian|last3=Blanco-Garcia|first3=Jose L.|last4=Hunley|first4=William S.|last5=Fentress|first5=Scott|last6=Wiggins|first6=Mike|last7=Mulholland|first7=Margaret R.|date=2011-09-01|title=Environmental and Physical Controls on the Formation and Transport of Blooms of the Dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides Margalef in the Lower Chesapeake Bay and Its Tributaries|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9398-2|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1006–1025|doi=10.1007/s12237-011-9398-2|issn=1559-2723}}&lt;/ref&gt; While HABs in the Gulf of Mexico have been occurring since the time of early explorers such as [[Cabeza de Vaca]],&lt;ref&gt;Cabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núnez. La Relación (1542). Translated by Martin A. dunsworth
 and José B. Fernández. Arte Público Press, Houston, Texas (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear what initiates these blooms and how large a role [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and natural factors play in their development. It is also unclear whether the apparent increase in frequency and severity of HABs in various parts of the world is in fact a real increase or is due to increased observation effort and advances in species identification technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However recent research found that the warming of summer surface temperatures of lakes, which rose by 0.34&amp;nbsp;°C decade per decade between 1985 and 2009 due to [[global warming]], also will likely increase algal blooming by 20% over the next century.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reiley et al, ''Rapid and highly variable warming of lake surface waters around the globe''.

Since many algal blooms are caused by a major influx of nutrient-rich runoff into a water body, programs to treat wastewater, reduce the overuse of fertilizers in agriculture and reducing the bulk flow of runoff can be effective for reducing severe algal blooms at river mouths, [[estuary|estuaries]], and the ocean directly in front of the river's mouth.

'''Alluvium''' (from the [[Latin]] ''alluvius'', from ''alluere'', "to wash against") is loose, unconsolidated (not cemented together into a solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]]) [[soil]] or [[sediment]] that has been [[Erosion|eroded]], reshaped by water in some form, and redeposited in a non-[[marine (ocean)|marine]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110501155938/http://www.geotech.org/survey/geotech/dictiona.html Glossary of Geological Terms]. Geotech.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/dictionary/glossary-a.shtml Geology Dictionary – Alluvial, Aquiclude, Arkose]. Geology.Com. Retrieved on 2012-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium is typically made up of a variety of materials, including fine particles of [[silt]] and [[clay]] and larger particles of [[sand]] and [[gravel]].  When this loose alluvial material is deposited or cemented into a [[Lithology|lithological]] unit, or [[Lithification|lithified]], it is called an '''alluvial deposit'''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Chisholm, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term "alluvium" is not typically used in situations where the formation of the sediment can clearly be attributed to another geologic process that is well described.  This includes (but is not limited to): lake sediments ([[Lake|lacustrine]]), river sediments ([[fluvial]]), or glacially-derived sediments ([[glacial till]]).  Sediments that are formed or deposited in a perennial stream or [[river]] are typically not referred to as alluvial.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Age==
Most alluvium is geologically [[Quaternary]] in age, and is often referred to as "cover" because these sediments obscure the underlying [[bedrock]].  Most sedimentary material that fills a [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] ("basin fill") that is not lithified is typically lumped together as "alluvial".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Alluvium of [[Pliocene]] age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ames | first = Dan | contribution = Formation of the Soils | year = 1998 | title = Soil Survey of Jerome County and Part of Twin Falls County, Idaho | pages = 238 | publisher = Natural Resources Conservation Service, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] | contribution-url = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MANUSCRIPTS/idaho/ID704/0/id704_text.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alluvium of late [[Miocene]] age occurs, for example, in the valley of the [[San Joaquin River]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1197/report.pdf | title=Amount and Timing of Late Cenozoic Uplift and Tilt of the Central Sierra Nevada, California—Evidence from the Upper San Joaquin River Basin (USGS Professional Paper 1197) | publisher=[[USGS]] | author=Huber, N.

==Ores==
Alluvium can contain valuable [[ore]]s such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]] and a wide variety of [[gemstone]]s. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a [[placer deposit]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

'''Amelogenin''' is the name for a series of closely related [[protein]]s involved in [[amelogenesis]], the development of [[tooth enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Amelogenin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a type of [[Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix (ECM)]] protein, which, together with [[ameloblastin]]s, [[enamelin]]s, and [[tuftelin]]s direct the mineralization of enamel to form a highly organized matrix of [[enamel rod|rods]], interrod crystal, and protein.  Although the precise role of amelogenin(s) in regulating the [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] process is unknown, it is known that amelogenins are abundant during amelogenesis.  Developing human enamel contains about 70% protein, 90% of which are amelogenins.

== Function ==
Amelogenins are believed to be involved in the organizing of [[enamel rod]]s during [[tooth development]]. The latest research indicates that these proteins regulate the initiation and growth of [[hydroxyapatite]] crystals during the mineralization of enamel. In addition, amelogenins appear to aid in the development of [[cementum]] by directing cementoblasts to the tooth's root surface.

== Variants ==
The amelogenin [[gene]] has been most widely studied in humans, where it is a single copy gene, located on the [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome]]s at Xp22.1-Xp22.3 and Yp 11.2 [5].&lt;ref name="pmid2004775"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Nakahori Y, Takenaka O, Nakagome Y |url= |format=|title=A human X-Y homologous region encodes "amelogenin" |journal=Genomics |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=264–9 |year=1991|pmid=2004775 |doi=10.1016/0888-7543(91)90251-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amelogenin gene’s location on sex chromosomes has implications for variability both between the X chromosome form ([[AMELX]]) and the Y chromosome form ([[AMELY]]), and between alleles of AMELY among different populations.  This is because AMELY exists in the [[genetic recombination|non-recombining]] region of chromosome Y, effectively isolating it from normal [[selection pressure]]s.  Other sources of amelogenin variation arise from the various [[protein isoform|isoforms]] of AMELX obtained from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts.  Specific roles for isoforms have yet to be established.  Among other organisms, amelogenin is well conserved among [[eutheria]]ns, and has homologs in [[monotreme]]s, reptiles and amphibians.

== Application in sex determination ==
Differences between the [[X chromosome]] and [[Y chromosome]] versions of the amelogenin gene (AMELX and AMELY respectively) enable it to be used in sex determination of unknown human samples.  [[AMELX]]’s intron 1 contains a 6 bp deletion relative to [[intron]] 1 of [[AMELY]].  This can be detected at low cost using Polymerase Chain Reaction ([[PCR]]) of intron 1, followed by [[gel electrophoresis]].  Two [[amplicon|bands]] of DNA, at 106bps and 112bps, are resolved if both the AMELX and AMELY versions of the gene are present (i.e. the sample is from a male) or one band of DNA, at 106bps, if the AMELX version only is present (i.e. the sample is from a female).&lt;ref name="pmid16603093"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kashyap VK, Sahoo S, Sitalaximi T, Trivedi R |title = Deletions in the Y-derived amelogenin gene fragment in the Indian population | journal = BMC Med Genet | volume = 7 | pages = 37 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16603093 | doi =10.1186/1471-2350-7-37 | pmc = 1458324 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-07-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However because of [[AMELY]] variation among individuals and populations, this method of sex determination is not 100% accurate.  Mutation in regions of AMELY intron 1 commonly used as [[nucleic acid thermodynamics|primer annealing sites]] may disable PCR amplification.  A 6bp [[indel|insertion]] to AMELY intron 1 results in an amplicon identical in length to that of AMELX.  In some males AMELY may be deleted entirely.  In any of these cases only one band is visualized during gel electrophoresis of PCR products, causing misidentification of the sample as female.&lt;ref name="pmid16603093"/&gt; The misidentification rate may vary among populations, but in general appears to be low. In one study in Spain, the amelogenin sex determination test using AMELX (977bps) and AMELY (790bps) bands was performed for 1224 individuals of known gender with a 99.84% (1222/1224) accuracy rate.&lt;ref name="pmid17716640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Francès F, Portolés O, González JI, Coltell O, Verdú F, Castelló A, Corella D |url= |format=|title=Amelogenin test: From forensics to quality control in clinical and biochemical genomics |journal=Clin Chim Acta |volume=386 |issue=1–2 |pages=53–6|year=2007|pmid=17716640 |doi=10.1016/j.cca.2007.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study in India, however, found 5 of its 270 men studied (1.85%) possessed an AMELY deletion, terming them “deleted-amelogenin males” (DAMs). In response the authors suggested that while the amelogenin sex test may be accurate in general, other Y chromosome markers such as [[SRY]], STR, or 50f2 can be used for less ambiguous gender identification.&lt;ref name="pmid12056520"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Thangaraj K, Reddy AG, Singh L |url= |format=|title=Is the amelogenin gene reliable for gender identification in forensic casework and prenatal diagnosis? |journal=Int J Legal Med |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=121–3|year=2002|pmid=12056520|doi=10.1007/s00414-001-0262-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollonius of Rhodes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀπολλώνιος Ῥόδιος}} ''Apollṓnios Rhódios''; {{lang-la|Apollonius Rhodius}}; fl. first half of 3rd century BCE), was an [[ancient Greek literature|ancient Greek author]], best known for the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] and their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both  innovative and influential, providing [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] with a "cultural mnemonic" or national "archive of images",&lt;ref&gt;S. Stephens, ''Ptolemaic Epic'', 96-8&lt;/ref&gt; and offering the Latin poets [[Virgil]] and [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Cnidus]]{{spaced ndash}}places of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. A literary dispute with [[Callimachus]], another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, although there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered a mere imitator of [[Homer]], and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history.&lt;ref&gt;T. Papanghelis and A. Rengakos, ''Editors' Introduction'', xi-xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Sources===
The most reliable information we have about ancient poets is largely drawn from their own works. Unfortunately, Apollonius of Rhodes reveals nothing about himself.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 52&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the biographical material comes from four sources: two are texts entitled ''Life of Apollonius'' found in the [[scholia]] on his work (''Vitae'' A and B); a third is an entry in the 10th-century encyclopaedia the ''[[Suda]]''; and fourthly a 2nd-century BCE papyrus, [[Oxyrhynchus|P.Oxy.]] 1241, which provides names of several heads of the [[Library of Alexandria]]. Other scraps can be gleaned from miscellaneous texts. The reports from all the above sources however are scanty and often self-contradictory.

===Main events===
*'''Birth.''' The two ''Lives'' and the ''[[Suda]]'' name Apollonius' father as Silleus or Illeus, but both names are very rare ([[hapax legomenon]]) and may derive from {{lang|grc|σίλλος}} or "lampoon", suggesting a comic source (ancient biographers often accepted or misconstrued the testimony of comic poets).&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 57&lt;/ref&gt; The second ''Life'' names his mother as "Rhode", but this is unlikely; ''Rhodē'' means "Rhodian woman", and is almost certainly derived from an attempt to explain Apollonius' epithet "Rhodian". The ''Lives'', the ''Suda'', and the geographical writer [[Strabo]] say that he came from [[Alexandria]];&lt;ref&gt;Strabo [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+14.2.13 14.2.13].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] say that he came from [[Naucratis]], some 70&amp;nbsp;km south of Alexandria along the river [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus ''Deipnosophistae'' 7.19; Aelian ''On the nature of animals'' 15.23.&lt;/ref&gt; No source gives the date of his birth.
*'''Association with Callimachus.''' The ''Lives'' and the ''Suda'' agree that Apollonius was a student of the poet and scholar [[Callimachus]]. ''Vita B'' states that Callimachus was his instructor in rhetoric ({{lang|grc|γραμματικός}}), but the terminology is anachronistic. Moreover, in ancient biographies "pupil" and "student" are figures of speech designating the influence one poet may have exercised over another.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; Their poetic works do in fact indicate a close relationship, if only as authors, with similarities in theme and composition, style and phrasing, but it is not easy to work out who was responding to whom, especially since 'publication' was a gradual process in those days, with shared readings of drafts and circulation of private copies: "In these circumstances interrelationships between writers who habitually cross-refer and allude to one another are likely to be complex."&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Bulloch, ''Hellenistic Poetry'', 587&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ptolemaeus III coin.jpg|thumb|right|A coin showing Ptolemy III Euergetes, who may have been a pupil of Apollonius]]
*'''Head of the Library of Alexandria.''' The second ''Life'', the ''Suda'', and P.Oxy. 1241 attest that Apollonius held this post. Moreover, P.Oxy. 1241 indicates that Apollonius was succeeded in the position by [[Eratosthenes]]; this must have been after 247/246 BCE, the date of the accession of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], who was probably tutored by Apollonius&lt;ref&gt;A. Bulloch, ''Hellenistic Poetry'', 586&lt;/ref&gt; and who appointed Eratosthenes. The chronology of P.Oxy. 1241 bears some signs of confusion since it lists Apollonius under [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (died 283 BCE), or [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] (born 210 BCE). The ''Suda'' says that Apollonius succeeded Eratosthenes, but this does not fit the evidence either.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 57&lt;/ref&gt; There was another Alexandrian librarian named Apollonius ("The Eidographer", succeeding [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] as library head) and this may have caused some of the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Bulloch, ''Hellenistic Poetry'', 586&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Association with Rhodes.''' The epithet ''Rhodios'' or ''Rhodian'' indicates that Apollonius had some kind of association with the island of that name. The ''Lives'' and the ''Suda'' attest to his move there from Alexandria. They differ about whether he died in Rhodes or came back to Alexandria to take up the position of head of the Library. According to ''Vita A'', he was a famous teacher in Rhodes, but it may have confused him with yet another Apollonius ([[Apollonius the Effeminate]]) who taught rhetoric there. In fact the epithet "of Rhodes" need not indicate any physical association with the island. It might simply reflect the fact that he once wrote a poem about Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 58, 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Athenaeus]], he was also called the "Naucratite". Some modern scholars doubt that he was ever given that title but, if he was, it may be because he composed a poem about the foundation of [[Naucratis]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 314&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Death.''' Only the two ''Lives'' give information about Apollonius' death, and they disagree. The first reports that he died in Rhodes; the second reports that he died after returning to Alexandria and adds that "some say" he was buried with Callimachus.

===Sensational stories===
Ancient biographies often represent famous poets as going into exile to escape their ungrateful fellow citizens. Thus for example Homer was said to have left Cyme because the government there would not support him at public expense (''Vit. Herod.'' 13-14), [[Aeschylus]] left Athens for Sicily because Athenians valued him less than some other poets (''Vit. Aesch.''), while [[Euripides]] fled to Macedonia because of humiliation by comic poets (''Vit. Eur.''). Similarly ''Vitae'' A and B tell us that Apollonius moved to Rhodes because his work was not well received in Alexandria. According to B, he redrafted the ''Argonautica'' in such fine style at Rhodes that he was able to return to Alexandria in triumph, where he was rewarded with a post in the library and finally a place in the cemetery next to Callimachus. These stories were probably invented to account for the existence of a second edition of ''Argonautica'', indicated by variant readings in ancient manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lefkowitz, ''Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius'', 59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently modern scholarship has made much of a feud between Callimachus and Apollonius. The evidence partly rests on an [[Elegy|elegiac]] epigram in the [[Greek Anthology|Palatine Anthology]], attributed to "Apollonius the grammarian". It blames Callimachus for some unstated offense and mocks both him and his most famous poem, the ''Aetia'' ("''Causes''"):&lt;ref&gt;''Pal. Anth''. 11.322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient sources describe Callimachus's poem ''Ibis'' &amp;mdash; which does not survive &amp;mdash; as a polemic and some of them identified Apollonius as the target.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;E.g. the ''Suda'' entry on Callimachus, [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;amp;login=guest&amp;amp;enlogin=guest&amp;amp;user_list=LIST&amp;amp;page_num=1&amp;amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;amp;searchstr=kappa%2C227 Suda 227] s.v. {{lang|grc|Καλλίμαχος}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These references conjure up images of a sensational literary feud between the two figures. Such a feud is consistent with what we know of Callimachus's taste for scholarly controversy and it might even explain why Apollonius departed for Rhodes. Thus there arises "a romantic vision of scholarly warfare in which Apollonius was finally driven out of Alexandria by a triumphant Callimachus".&lt;ref&gt;R. Hunter, ''Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica, Book III'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of the ''Lives'' of Apollonius stress the friendship between the poets, the second ''Life'' even saying they were buried together; moreover Callimachus's poem ''Ibis'' is known to have been deliberately obscure and some modern scholars believe the target was never meant to be identified.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''Callimachus and his Critics'', 228&lt;/ref&gt; There is still not a consensus about the feud, but most scholars of Hellenistic literature now believe it has been enormously sensationalised, if it happened at all.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For different views of the feud see for example M. Lefkowitz 2011 "Myth and History in the Biography of Apollonius" in ''A Companion to Apollonius Rhodius'' (Brill, 51-71); P. Green, 1997, ''The Argonautika'' (Berkeley, 1-3); D.P. Nelis 1999 review of Green's book, in ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 119: 187. For a summary of contrasting views, see e.g. A. Cameron 1995, ''Callimachus and his Critics'' (Princeton, 214-228);&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeric scholar===
Apollonius was among the foremost Homeric scholars in the Alexandrian period. He wrote the period's first scholarly monograph on Homer, critical of the editions of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' published by [[Zenodotus]], his predecessor as head of the Library of Alexandria. ''Argonautica'' seems to have been written partly as an experimental means of communicating his own researches into Homer's poetry. It has even been called "a kind of poetic dictionary of Homer", without at all detracting from its merits as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rengakos, ''Apollonius Rhodius as a Homeric Scholar'', 244, 265&lt;/ref&gt; He has been credited with scholarly prose works on [[Archilochus]] and on problems in [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', xi&lt;/ref&gt; He is also considered to be one of the period's most important authors on geography, though approaching the subject differently from [[Eratosthenes]], his successor at the library and a radical critic of Homer's geography. It was a time when the accumulation of scientific knowledge was enabling advances in geographical studies, as represented by the activities of [[Timosthenes]], a Ptolemaic admiral and a prolific author. Apollonius set out to integrate new understandings of the physical world with the mythical geography of tradition and his ''Argonautica'' was, in that sense, a didactic epic on geography, again without detracting from its merits as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;D. Meyer, ''Apollonius as a Hellenistic Geographer'', 273–74, 277, 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==His poetry==
===Poems===
====''Argonautica''====
{{main|Argonautica}}

The ''Argonautica'' differs in some respects from traditional or Homeric Greek epic, though Apollonius certainly used Homer as a model.  The ''Argonautica'' is shorter than Homer's epics, with four books totalling fewer than 6000 lines, while the ''[[Iliad]]'' runs to more than 16,000. Apollonius may have been influenced here by Callimachus's brevity, or by [[Aristotle]]’s demand for "poems on a smaller scale than the old epics, and answering in length to the group of tragedies presented at a single sitting" (the ''Poetics'').

Apollonius' epic also differs from the more traditional epic in its weaker, more human protagonist Jason and in its many digression into local custom, [[aetiology]], and other popular subjects of Hellenistic poetry.  Apollonius also chooses the less shocking versions of some myths, having [[Medea]], for example, merely watch the murder of [[Apsyrtus]] instead of murdering him herself.  The gods are relatively distant and inactive throughout much of the epic, following the Hellenistic trend to allegorise and rationalise religion.  Heterosexual loves such as Jason's are more emphasized than homosexual loves such as that of [[Heracles]] and [[Hylas]], another trend in Hellenistic literature.  Many critics regard the love of Medea and Jason in the third book as the best written and most memorable episode.

Opinions on the poem have changed over time. Some critics in antiquity considered it mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] ''On the sublime'' 33.4; [[Quintilian]] ''Institutio oratoria'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.54 10.1.54].&lt;/ref&gt; Recent criticism has seen a renaissance of interest in the poem and an awareness of its qualities: numerous scholarly studies are published regularly, its influence on later poets like [[Virgil]] is now well recognised, and any account of the history of epic poetry now routinely includes substantial attention to Apollonius.

====Foundation-poems====
A handful of fragments are all that survive of his other work, mostly ''ktiseis'' ({{lang|grc|κτίσεις}}) or 'foundation-poems', apparently dealing with the mythical origins of cities, a theme that Apollonius also touches on in ''Argonautica'' (as for example in the foundation of [[Cius]], 1.1321-23). The fragments have been given considerable attention recently, with speculation about their authenticity, about the subject matter and treatment of the original poems, their geo-political significance for Ptolemaic Egypt, and how they relate to ''Argonautika''.&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 312-13&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Founding of Alexandria''': all that survives is the title and a scholar's marginal note, written in a manuscript of a different author ([[Nicander]]), attributing to this Apollonius poem the statement that all biting creatures originated from the blood of the [[Gorgon]].
*'''The Founding of Caunus''': two comments in [[Parthenius of Nicaea|Parthenius]]'s ''Love Stories'' are the only testament to this poem but they seem to give conflicting accounts. According to one, it deals with the story of [[Lyrcus]]; according to the other, it deals with the story of [[Byblis]]. This might indicate a loose, episodic structure, rather than a unified narrative. It might then be inferred that this kind of treatment was typical of his other foundation poems as well&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 327-28&lt;/ref&gt; (the question of unity is one of the main issues even in ''Argonautica'', which is sometimes termed an "episodic epic").&lt;ref&gt;R. Glei, ''Outlines of Apollinian Scholarship 1955-1999'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; Five hexameter verses attributed to Apollonius may be a fragment of this poem but they seem unrelated to the stories of Lyrcus and Byblis and some scholars think they come from the next poem.
*'''The Founding of Cnidus''': [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] wrote the following entry for {{lang|grc|Ψυκτήριος}} (Cooling){{spaced ndash}}"a place in Thrace, taking its name from Heracles, who cooled off his sweat when he threw Adramyles in wrestling, as Apollonius says in his ''Founding of Cnidus''."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanus's entry is quoted from the translation in W. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', 477&lt;/ref&gt; That's all we know of the poem, unless the five hexameter lines belong here, and those describe sea routes also dealt with in ''Argonautica''.
*'''The Founding of Naucratis''': Athenaeus quotes six and bit hexameters and provides a commentary, concerning Apollo's abduction of [[Ocyrhoe]] and the punishment of a fisherman, Pompilus, who tried to protect her and was turned into a fish of the same name. According to the commentary, the Pompilus fish was a topic of great interest to poets and scholars, including Callimachus and [[Theocritus]]. It may be inferred that Apollonius developed a melodramatic story of passion from the etymology ("pompilus" denotes an "escort fish"). It is not known how this episode might have fitted into a poem on the origins of Naucratis. Possibly a broad-based account of its foundation owed something to [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 323&lt;/ref&gt;  
*'''The Founding of Rhodes''': all that we have is one and a bit hexameters, quoted by Stephanus of Byzantium to demonstrate a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] point, and the testimony of a [[scholium]] to [[Pindar]]'s ''Victory Ode'' 7.48, citing Apollonius as the source for a [[Myth of origins|myth]] explaining the Rhodian practice of sacrificing without fire{{spaced ndash}}they hated the fire-god [[Hephaestus]] because he once tried to rape [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', 480-81&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Founding of Lesbos''': twentyone hexameters were quoted by Parthenius under the title ''Lesbou ktisis''. The author's name was not given but modern scholars attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, [[Peisidice]], who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, [[Achilles]]. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning at the hands of the [[Argives]]. It can be argued that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with ''Argonautica'', epic material has been used unconventionally as a window into the female psyche.&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 336&lt;/ref&gt;

====Others====
*'''Canobus''': three [[choliamb]]ic verses were quoted by Stephanus Byzantius from a poem of this title, and a scholium to Nicander's ''Theriaca'' refers to it in a discussion on snake bites. It isn't known if the poem was about Canobus (sometimes called [[Canopus]]), the helmsman of [[Menelaus]], buried in Egypt, or about the foundation of the city bearing his name. The choliambic meter distinguishes it from the above foundation poems, which are all in dactylic hexameters.&lt;ref&gt;E. Sistakou, ''In Search of Apollonius' 'Ktisis' Poems'', 313&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Callimachus epigram''': The epigram, quoted in the biography section, was preserved in the [[Palatine Anthology]], where it was attributed to 'Apollonius the Grammarian'. This might not have been Apollonius of Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius'', 473&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetic style===
Apollonius's poetic skills and technique have only recently come to be appreciated, with critical recognition of his successful fusing of poetry and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rengakos, ''Apollonius Rhodius as a Homeric Scholar'', 265&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astro microbiology''', or exo microbiology, is the study of [[microorganisms]] in outer space. It stems from an interdisciplinary approach, which incorporates both [[microbiology]] and [[astrobiology]]. Astrobiology's efforts are aimed at understanding the origins of life and the search for life other than on Earth. Because microorganisms are the most widespread form of life on Earth, and are capable of colonising almost any environment, scientists usually focus on microbial life in the field of astrobiology. Moreover, small and simple cells usually evolve first on a planet rather than larger, [[multicellular organisms]], and have an increased likelihood of being transported from one planet to another via the [[panspermia]] theory.&lt;ref name="PSAU"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://faculty.psau.edu.sa/m.rahamathulla/page/3601 | title=Exo microbiology (or Astro microbiology) | publisher=Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Rahamathulla, Mohamudha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary Exploration ==

[[File:Eso1509a - Mars planet.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Depiction of a once water covered Mars]]
The search for extraterrestrial microbial life have focused mostly on [[Mars]] due to its promising environment and close proximity; however, other astrobiological sites include the moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Enceladus]]. All of these sites currently have or have had a recent history of possessing liquid water, which scientists hypothesize as the most consequential precursor for biological life. Europa and Enceladus appear to have large amounts of liquid water hidden beneath the layers of ice that covers their surfaces. Titan, on the other hand, is only planetary body besides Earth with liquid hydrocarbons on its surface. Mars is the main area of interest for the search for life primarily because of convincing evidence that suggests surface liquid water activity in recent history. Furthermore, Mars has an atmosphere containing abundant amounts of carbon and nitrogen, both essential elements needed for life.&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/9780470015902.a0021899/asset/a0021899.pdf?v=1&amp;t=io3v5qmq&amp;s=0b2b4f2b1c2ad43d928103c34c0febbf39660bdc&amp;systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+14th+May+11%3A00-14%3A00+BST+%2F+06%3A00-09%3A00+EDT+%2F+18%3A00-21%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience. | title=Astromicrobiology | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | work=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | date=10 September 2010 | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Davila, Alfonso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==

So far, the search for microbial life in extraterrestrial locations have been less than successful. The first of such attempts, occurred through NASA's [[Viking program]] in the 1970s, in which two Mars landers were used to conduct experiments that searched for biosignatures of life on Mars. The landers utilized robotic arms to collect soil samples into sealed containers that were brought back to Earth. The results were largely inconclusive, although some scientists still dispute them.

In 2008, Russian cosmonauts reported findings of sea [[plankton]] living on the outside surfaces of the International Space stations windows. They have yet to find explanations for the discovery, but it seems to have been a result of human contamination, though this may never be proven.

Currently, the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission has a rover on Mars that continues to be operational. Launched on 26 November 2011, and landing at [[Gale Crater]] on 6 August 2012, its goals are to assess the habitability of Mars' environment – amongst its collection of data for Martian geology, climate and availability of water, are instruments that search for biosignatures daily. Thus far, its results have not been fruitful.

== Experimentation ==

=== Earth ===
Many studies on Earth have been conducted to collect data on the response of terrestrial microbes to various simulated environmental conditions of outer space. The responses of microbes, such as viruses, bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and lichens, to isolated factors of outer space (microgravity, galactic cosmic radiation, solar UV radiation, and space vacuum) were determined in space and laboratory simulation experiments. In general, microorganisms tended to thrive in the simulated space flight environment – subjects showed symptoms of enhanced growth and an uncharacteristic ability to proliferate despite the presence of normally suppressive levels of antibiotics. The mechanisms responsible for explaining these enhanced responses have yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name="Horneck, Gerda 2010 121–156"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2832349 | title=Space Microbiology | author=Horneck, Gerda | journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | year=2010 | volume=74 | issue=1 | pages=121–156 | doi=10.1128/mmbr.00016-09 | pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space ===
The ability of microorganisms to survive in an outer space environment was investigated to approximate upper boundaries of the biosphere and to determine the accuracy of the interplanetary transport theory for microorganisms. Among the investigated variables, solar UV radiation had the most harmful effect on microbial samples. Among all the samples, only lichens ([[Rhizocarpon geographicum]] and [[Xanthoria elegans]]) fully survived the 2 weeks of exposure to outer space. Earth's ozone layer greatly protects against the deleterious effects of solar UV, which is why organisms typically are unable to survive without ozone protection. When shielded against solar UV, various samples were able to survive for long periods of times; spores of [[B. subtilis]], for example, were able to proliferate in space for up to 6 years. The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, called [[lithopanspermia]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Horneck, Gerda 2010 121–156"/&gt;

=== Mars ===
[[File:Anabaenaflosaquae EPA.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.66|Anabaena flosaquae, a cyanobacterium that would thrive on Mars]]
Modern technology has already allowed us to use microbes to assist us in extracting materials on Earth, including over 25% of the our current copper supply. Similarly, microbes could help serve a similar purpose on other planets to mine resources, extract useful materials, or create self-sustaining reactors. The most promising of these candidates known to date is [[cyanobacteria]]. [[Cyanobacteria#Earth_history|Billions of years ago]], cyanobacteria originally helped us create a habitable Earth by pumping oxygen into the atmosphere, and manage to exist in the darkest corners of the Earth. Cyanobacteria, along with some other rock-eating microbes, seem to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the vacuum of space without much effort. On Mars, however, cyanobacteria will not even have to endure such harsh conditions.&lt;ref name="Microbes Colonize Earth"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/how-microbes-could-help-colonize-mars/ | title=How Microbes Could Help Colonize Mars | publisher=NASA | work=Astrobiology Magazine | date=9 September 2010 | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Hsu, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are currently working on the possibility of installing bioreactors or similar facilities on Mars, which would run entirely on cyanobacteria and provide material for the creation of fuel cells, soil crust formation, regolith amelioration, extraction of useful metals/elements, nutrient release into the soil, and dust removal; a variety of other potentially useful functions are also in the works.&lt;ref name="Microbes Colonize Earth"/&gt;

'''Brainwave entrainment''', also referred to as '''brainwave synchronization'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fredricks | first=R. | title=Healing and Wholeness: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Mental Health | publisher=All Things Well Publications/AuthorHouse | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4343-8336-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAr791hnIc4C&amp;pg=PA120 | accessdate=April 5, 2017 | page=120}} and&lt;/ref&gt; and '''neural entrainment''', refers to the hypothesized capacity of the brain to naturally synchronize its brainwave frequencies with the rhythm of periodic external stimuli, most commonly auditory, visual, or tactile.

It is widely accepted that patterns of neural firing, measured in Hz, correspond with states of alertness such as focused attention, deep sleep, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Neurotherapy: Application of Techniques for Treatment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=j6-NfhUbLfQC&amp;pg=PA177|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2013-10-18|isbn = 9780123972910|first = David S.|last = Cantor|first2 = James R.|last2 = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is hypothesized that listening to these beats of certain frequencies one can induce a desired state of consciousness that corresponds with specific neural activity.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} 

==Neural oscillation and electroencephalography (EEG)==
{{main|Neural oscillation}}
[[Neural oscillation]]s are rhythmic or repetitive electrochemical activity in the [[brain]] and [[central nervous system]]. Such [[oscillation]]s can be characterized by their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. [[Nervous tissue|Neural tissue]] can generate oscillatory activity driven by mechanisms within individual [[neuron]]s, as well as by interactions between them. They may also adjust [[frequency]] to [[Synchronization|synchronize]] with the [[Audio frequency|periodic vibration]] of external [[Sound|acoustic]] or [[visual perception|visual]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].&lt;ref&gt;Niedermeyer E. and da Silva F.L., Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of [[neuron]]s generate [[electric current]]s; and the [[Synchronization|synchronous]] action of [[neural ensemble]]s in the cerebral cortex, comprising large numbers of [[neuron]]s, produce macroscopic [[Neural oscillation|oscillations]].  These phenomena can be monitored and graphically documented by an [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG). The [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalographic]] representations of those [[Neural oscillation|oscillations]] are typically denoted by the term 'brainwaves' in common parlance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = da Silva FL | year = 1991 | title = Neural mechanisms underlying brain waves: from neural membranes to networks | url = | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 79 | issue = 2| pages = 81–93 | pmid = 1713832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooper R, Winter A, Crow H, Walter WG | year = 1965 | title = Comparison of subcortical, cortical, and scalp activity using chronically indwelling electrodes in man | url = | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 217–230 | doi=10.1016/0013-4694(65)90088-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of recording [[Neural oscillation|neural electrical activity]] within the [[brain]] from [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] readings taken from the [[scalp]] originated with the experiments of [[Richard Caton]] in 1875, whose findings were developed into [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) by [[Hans Berger]] in the late 1920s.

==Entrainment==

===Meaning and origin of the term 'entrainment'===
Entrainment is a term originally derived from [[Complex systems | complex systems theory]], and denotes the way that two or more independent, autonomous [[Oscillation|oscillators]] with differing rhythms or [[Frequency|frequencies]], when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on [[Couple (mechanics)|coupling force]], such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.
Examples include the [[Injection locking#Entrainment|mechanical entrainment]] or cyclic [[synchronization]] of two electric clothes dryers placed in close proximity, and the biological entrainment evident in the synchronized illumination of [[Firefly|fireflies]].&lt;ref name="Néda, Z. 2000, pp849"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Néda Z, Ravasz E, Brechet Y, Vicsek T, Barabsi AL | year = 2000 | title = Self-organizing process: The sound of many hands clapping | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6772| pages = 849–850 | doi=10.1038/35002660| pmid = 10706271 | arxiv = cond-mat/0003001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrainment is a concept first identified by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Physics|physicist]] [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1665 who discovered the phenomenon during an experiment with [[pendulum]] clocks: He set them each in motion and found that when he returned the next day, the sway of their pendulums had all [[Synchronization|synchronized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantaleone J | year = 2002 | title = Synchronization of Metronomes | url = | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 70 | issue = 10| pages = 992–1000 | doi=10.1119/1.1501118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such entrainment occurs because small amounts of [[energy]] are transferred between the two systems when they are out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]] in such a way as to produce [[negative feedback]]. As they assume a more stable [[Phase (waves)|phase]] relationship, the amount of [[energy]] gradually reduces to zero, with systems of greater [[frequency]] slowing down, and the other speeding up.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M., Schatz, M. F., Rockwood, H., and Wiesenfeld, K., Huygens's clocks. Proceedings: Mathematics, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 2002, pp563-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the term 'entrainment' has been used to describe a shared tendency of many physical and [[Biology|biological]] systems to [[Synchronization|synchronize]] their periodicity and [[rhythm]] through interaction. This tendency has been identified as specifically pertinent to the study of [[sound]] and [[music]] generally, and [[Acoustics|acoustic]] rhythms specifically. The most ubiquitous and familiar examples of neuromotor [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment to acoustic stimuli]] is observable in spontaneous foot or finger tapping to the rhythmic beat of a [[song]].

===Brainwave entrainment===

Brainwaves, or [[neural oscillation]]s, share the fundamental constituents with [[Sound|acoustic]] and [[Light|optical]] [[wave]]s, including [[frequency]], [[amplitude]] and periodicity. Consequently, Huygens' discovery precipitated inquiry{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} into whether or not the [[Synchronization|synchronous]] [[Electric current|electrical activity]] of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[neural ensemble]]s might not only alter in response to external [[Acoustics|acoustic]] or [[Visual perception|optical]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] but also entrain or [[Synchronization|synchronize]] their frequency to that of a specific stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Will, U., and Berg, E., "Brainwave synchronization and entrainment to periodic stimuli" ''Neuroscience Letters'', Vol. 424, 2007, pp 55–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cade, G. M. and Coxhead, F., The awakened mind, biofeedback and the development of higher states of awareness. New York, NY: Delacorte Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neher, A., "Auditory driving observed with scalp electrodes in normal subjects. ''Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology'', Vol. 13, 1961, pp 449–451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakharova, N. N., and Avdeev, V. M., "Functional changes in the central nervous system during music perception. ''Zhurnal vysshei nervnoi deiatelnosti imeni IP Pavlova'' Vol. 32, No. 5, 1981, pp 915-924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brainwave entrainment is a colloquialism for such 'neural entrainment', which is a term used to denote the way in which the aggregate frequency of [[oscillation]]s produced by the synchronous electrical activity in ensembles of cortical [[neuron]]s can adjust to synchronize with the periodic vibration of an external stimuli, such as a sustained acoustic frequency perceived as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], a regularly repeating pattern of intermittent sounds, perceived as [[rhythm]], or of a regularly rhythmically intermittent flashing light.

==Music and the frequency following response==

Meanwhile, the therapeutic benefits of listening to [[sound]] and [[music]] is a well-established principle upon which the practice of receptive [[music therapy]] is founded. The term 'receptive music therapy' denotes a process by which patients or participants listen to [[music]] with specific intent to therapeutically benefit; and is a term used by therapists to distinguish it from 'active music therapy' by which patients or participants engage in producing [[Human voice|vocal]] or [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruscia, K., Defining music therapy.

(2007). Receptive methods in music therapy: Techniques and clinical applications for music therapy clinicians, educators, and students. London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frequency following response]] (FFR), also referred to as Frequency Following Potential (FFP), is a specific response to hearing sound and music,  by which [[neural oscillation]]s adjust their frequency to match the rhythm of [[Auditory system|auditory]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].

'''Cable lacing''' is a method for tying [[Cable harness|wiring harness]]es and [[cable loom]]s, traditionally used in [[telecommunication]], naval, and aerospace applications.  This old [[cable management]] technique, taught to generations of [[Lineman (technician)|linemen]],&lt;ref name="popmech1905"&gt;{{Citation|title=Cable Sewing Knots|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=May 1905|volume=7|number=5|issn=0032-4558|page=550|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA550|quote=Every lineman should know how to sew these knots.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions along the length of the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or [[Hook-and-loop fastener|hook-and-loop]] [[cable tie]]s.

Cable lacing uses a thin cord, traditionally made of waxed [[linen]], to bind together a group of cables using a series of running [[lockstitch]]es.  Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[Teflon]], [[fiberglass]], and [[Nomex]] are also available with a variety of coatings to improve knot holding.&lt;ref name="gudebrod"&gt;{{cite web|title=Braid Lacing Tape |url=http://www.gudebrod.com/electronic/Braid_Lacing_Tape.htm |author=Gudebrod, Inc. |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201164010/http://www.gudebrod.com/electronic/Braid_Lacing_Tape.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nebenstellenanlage-Kabelbaum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[PABX]] with extensive cable lacing]]

==Styles==
The lacing begins and ends with a [[whipping knot|whipping]] or other [[knot]] to secure the free ends.  Wraps are spaced relative to the overall harness diameter to maintain the wiring in a tight, neat bundle, and the ends are then neatly trimmed.  In addition to continuous or running lacing, there are a variety of lacing patterns used in different circumstances.  In some cases stand-alone knots called '''spot ties''' are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wiring and Cable Designer's Handbook |last=Matisoff |first=Bernard S. |year=1987 |publisher= TAB Books|location=Summit, PA |isbn=0-8306-2720-0 |pages= 93–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[Lashing (ropework)|lashing]] large cables and cable bundles to support structures in telecommunications applications, there are two named cable lacing styles: the "[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] stitch" and "[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] stitch".&lt;ref name="qwest"&gt;{{cite web

Some organizations have in-house standards to which cable lacing must conform, for example [[NASA]] specifies its cable lacing techniques in chapter 9 of NASA-STD-8739.4.&lt;ref name="nasanote"&gt;See "External Links" section for these documents.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre of Ecology &amp; Rural Development''' ('''CERD''') is an Indian organisation which is part of the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]]. It was exclusively formed for taking up meaningful interventions in Health, Sanitation, Natural Resource Management, Energy, Watershed management and ICT for development.

CERD was set up in the year 1994 jointly by the [[Pondicherry Science Forum]] and [[Tamil Nadu Science Forum]] to take up S&amp;T based development initiatives improving the rural livelihoods of weaker sections. The earlier works included interventions in sericulture, vegetable leather tanning, fish aggregation device etc.

CERD has a field station at Bahoor called the [[Kalanjiyam]] (meaning Granary in Tamil) which acts has a hub of [[agriculture]] and technology options for the surrounding area.

CERD has a full-time manpower structure with a committed team of scientists working on a variety of areas ranging from women’s technology, [[science communication]], Continuing Education, Participatory Irrigation management through local democratic people’s institutions, women’s micro credit networks etc.

The latest of the projects that CERD is now implementing includes the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130206050236/http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/whats_new12/EOI-WTP.pdf Women’s Technology Park] (WTP), an AICP Project on BIOFARM, a watershed development project in [[Sedappatti]] Block of Madurai funded by [[NABARD]], the Tank Rehabilitation Project-Pondicherry etc.

==Soil Fertility Management==

R&amp;D Work on Alternate Soil [[Fertility Management]] Strategies
Systems for Irrigated and dry land crops.
Developed Decision System (DSS) for [[Soil]] Fertility Mgmt.

==Bio resource integrated Farming==

Reduction of external inputs.
Increasing internal resource flows in the [[farming system]].
Ensuring nutritional security of the whole farming system.

==Watershed Development==

Initiated programmes in Madurai district.
Participatory planning, implementation and management of the [[Drainage basin|Watershed]] through people’s organizations.

==Participatory Irrigation Mgmt==

Pilot work on irrigation tanks in Pondicherry.
Evolved guidelines for sustainable institutional structures.
All stakeholder participation ensured including women, dalits of landless communities.
Large scale encroachment eviction through participatory approach leading to Participatory Irrigation Mgmt.
Worked in low energy technologies for water system development (Oorani – drinking water pond) in [[Ramanathapuram]]

==Wasteland Reclamation==

Evolved successful models for participatory wasteland reclamation through coalition 
between landless SHG women and farmers’ groups.
Sustainable income for landless Self-help Group (SHG) women through collective farming.

==ICT for Rural Development==

Established the first successful model of Village Information Centre known as '''Samadhan Kendra''' through 
unique content creation in local language.
Software creation for local planning and for primary production in local language 
including Decision Support Systems.

==Fuel Efficient Stoves==

CERD will expand its activities in this area by constructing more stoves and also by expanding the works to other areas like Tamil Nadu etc. CERD construction of a fuel efficient Tawa for making dosa/parotta also more of this also will be done during the coming years. Subsidies from the [[Renewable Energy Agency]] will be sought for the Tawa stove also and that will be another recognition for the work being carried out.

==Biomass based Biogas Units==

With technical collaboration from [[IISc]]. [[Bangalore]], CERD will be constructing 
[[biogas]] units and this will be a new area that CERD will be treading to. 
The units are not gobar based but instead will be based on biomass
decomposition and tapping the biogas for cooking purposes.

==Organic Farming==

Already an Organic Farmers’ Association has been formed and CERD will be extending full 
support to expanding this network including getting organic certification processes 
for the farmers and for arranging marketing linkages for their organic produce. 
This will have full backward and forward linkages starting from seeds, 
plant protection, harvest and post harvest options.

==Nutrition based Kitchen Gardening systems==

This will be mainly women-focused especially for women under SHGs 
since the malnutrition levels of women in [[Pondicherry]] 
are very high and it is estimated that about 80% women face malnutrition. 
This programme also will have complete backward and forward linkages from seeds, 
biomanures, bio pesticides, processing and value addition etc.

==Micro enterprises for SHG women and for weaker sections==

CERD will be concentrating more on viable village level enterprises for improved livelihood options for women, dalits and other weaker sections with providing necessary S&amp;T inputs and EDP skills.

'''Congruence bias''' is a type of [[cognitive bias]] similar to [[confirmation bias]]. Congruence bias occurs due to people's overreliance on directly testing a given [[hypothesis]] as well as neglecting indirect testing.

==Examples==
Suppose that, in an [[experiment]]al setting, a subject is presented with two buttons and told that pressing one of those buttons, but not the other, will open a door. The subject adopts the hypothesis that the button on the left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing the button on the left; an indirect test would be pressing the button on the right. The latter is still a valid test because once the result of the door's remaining closed is found, the left button is proven to be the desired button. (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, ''[[#CITEREFBrunerGoodnowAustin1956|A Study of Thinking]]''.)

It is possible to take this idea of direct and indirect testing and apply it to more complicated experiments in order to explain the presence of a congruence bias in people. In an experiment, a subject will test his own usually naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.

The classic example of subjects' congruence bias was discovered by [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]] ([[#CITEREFWason1960|1960]], [[#CITEREFWason1968|1968]]).  Here, the experimenter gave subjects the number sequence "2, 4, 6", telling the subjects that this sequence followed a particular rule and instructing subjects to find the rule underlying the sequence logic. Subjects provided their own number sequences as tests to see if they could ascertain the rule dictating which numbers could be included in the sequence and which could not. Most subjects respond to the task by quickly deciding that the underlying rule is "numbers ascending by 2", and provide as tests only sequences concordant with this rule, such as "3, 5, 7," or even "pi plus 2, plus 4, plus 6". Each of these sequences follows the underlying rule the experimenter is thinking of, though "numbers ascending by 2" is not the actual criterion being used. However, because subjects succeed at repeatedly testing the same singular principle, they naively believe their chosen hypothesis is correct. When a subject offers up to the experimenter the hypothesis "numbers ascending by 2" only to be told he is wrong, much confusion usually ensues. At this point, many subjects attempt to change the wording of the rule without changing its meaning, and even those who switch to indirect testing have trouble letting go of the "+ 2" convention, producing potential rules as idiosyncratic as "the first two numbers in the sequence are random, and the third number is the second number plus two". Many subjects never realize that the actual rule the experimenter was using was simply just to list ascending numbers, because of the subjects' inability to consider indirect tests of their hypotheses.

==Cognitive basis==
Wason attributed this failure of subjects to an inability to consider alternative hypotheses, which is the root of the congruence bias. [[Jonathan Baron]] explains that subjects could be said to be using a "congruence heuristic", wherein a hypothesis is tested only by thinking of results that would be found if that hypothesis is true. This heuristic, which many people seem to use, ignores alternative hypotheses.

Baron suggests the following heuristics to avoid falling into the congruence bias trap:
# Ask "How likely is a yes answer, if I assume that my hypothesis is false?" Remember to choose a test that has a high probability of giving some answer if the hypothesis is true, and a low probability if it is false.
# "Try to think of alternative hypotheses; then choose a test most likely to distinguish them—a test that will probably give different results depending on which is true." An example of the need for the heuristic could be seen in a doctor's attempting to diagnose [[appendicitis]]. In that situation, assessing a [[white blood cell]] count would not assist in diagnosis because an elevated white blood cell count is associated with a number of maladies.

In [[developmental psychology]] and [[developmental biology]], a '''critical period''' is a maturational stage in the lifespan of an organism during which the nervous system is especially sensitive to certain environmental stimuli. If, for some reason, the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this "critical period" to learn a given skill or trait, it may be difficult, ultimately less successful, or even impossible, to develop some functions later in life. Functions that are indispensable to an organism's survival, such as vision, are particularly likely to develop during critical periods. "Critical period" also relates to the ability to acquire one's first language. Researchers found that people who passed the "critical period" would not acquire their first language fluently.&lt;ref name="Robson"&gt;Robson, Ann L. "Critical/Sensitive Periods." Child Development. Ed. Neil J. Salkind. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2002. 101-103. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers differentiate between 'critical' and 'sensitive' periods—defining 'sensitive' periods as more extended periods, after which learning is still possible.&lt;ref&gt;Brainard, M. S., &amp; Knudsen, E. I. (1998). Sensitive periods for visual calibration of the auditory space map in the barn owl optic tectum. ''The Journal of Neuroscience'', ''18(''10), 3929-3942.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers consider these the same phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hensch | first1 = T. K. | year = 2004 | title = Critical period regulation | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144327 | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 549–579 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the critical period for the development of a human child's [[binocular vision]] is thought to be between three and eight months, with sensitivity to damage extending up to at least three years of age. Further critical periods have been identified for the development of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]&lt;ref name= "Kral2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kral A |title= Auditory critical periods: A review from system's perspective |journal= Neuroscience |volume= 247 | pages=117–133 |year= 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.05.021 |pmid=23707979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[vestibular system]].{{ref|Moorman}}

==Linguistics==

{{Main|Critical period hypothesis}}

===First language acquisition===
The [[critical period hypothesis]] (CPH) states that the first few years of life constitute the time during which language develops readily and after which (sometime between age 5 and [[puberty]]) language acquisition is much more difficult and ultimately less successful.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;Siegler, Robert (2006). How Children Develop, Exploring Child Develop Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop. New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7167-6113-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that language is acquired during a critical period was first proposed by neurologists Wilder Penfield and Lamar Roberts in 1959 and popularized by linguist Eric H. Lenneberg in 1967. Lenneberg argued for the hypothesis based on evidence that children who experience brain injury early in life develop far better language skills than adults with similar injuries.

[[Dr. Maria Montessori]] was one of the earlier educators who brought attention to this phenomenon and called it "Sensitive Periods", which is one of the pillars of [[Montessori education|her philosophy of education]].

The two most famous cases of children who failed to acquire language after the critical period are [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]] and the feral child [[Victor of Aveyron]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, S. (1977). ''Genie: a psycholinguistic study of a modern-day wild child''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tragic circumstances of these cases and the moral and ethical impermissibility of replicating them make it difficult to draw conclusions about them. The children may have been cognitively disabled from infancy, or their inability to develop language may have resulted from the profound neglect and abuse they suffered.&lt;ref name="Siegler" /&gt;

Many subsequent researchers have further developed the CPH, most notably [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]] and Rachel Mayberry. Studies conducted by these researchers demonstrated that profoundly deaf individuals who are not exposed to a sign language as children never achieve full proficiency, even after 30 years of daily use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newport | first1 = E. L. | year = 1990 | title = Maturational constraints on language learning | url = | journal = Cognitive science | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 11–28 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is most profound for individuals who receive no sign language input until after the age of 12, even those deaf people who began learning a sign language at age 5 were significantly less fluent than native deaf signers (whose exposure to a sign language began at birth). Early language exposure also affects the ability to learn a second language later in life: profoundly deaf individuals with early language exposure achieve comparable levels of proficiency in a second language to hearing individuals with early language exposure. In contrast, deaf individuals without early language exposure perform far worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayberry | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Lock | first2 = E. | last3 = Kazmi | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Development: Linguistic ability and early language exposure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6884| pages = 38–38 | doi=10.1038/417038a|bibcode = 2002Natur.417...38M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Pinker discusses the CPH in his book, The Language Instinct. According to Pinker, language must be viewed as a concept rather than a specific language because the sounds, grammar, meaning, vocabulary, and social norms play an important role in the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eric. "First-Language Acquisition." Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education. Ed. Josué M. González. Vol. 1. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2008. 299-304. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 22 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological changes in the brain are also conceivable causes for the terminus of the critical period for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Pinker1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Pinker |first1= Steven |title=The Language Instinct |year=1994|publisher= Morrow |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As language acquisition is crucial during this phase, similarly infant-parent attachment is crucial for social development of the infant. An infant learns to trust and feel safe with the parent, but there are cases in which the infant might be staying at an orphanage where it does not receive the same attachment with their caregiver. Research shows that infants who were unable to develop this attachment had major difficulty in keeping close relationships, and had maladaptive behaviors with adopted parents.&lt;ref name="Robson" /&gt;

Other evidence comes from [[neuropsychology]] where it is known that adults well beyond the critical period are more likely to suffer permanent language impairment from brain damage than are children, believed to be due to youthful resiliency of neural reorganization.&lt;ref name="Siegler"/&gt;

===Second language acquisition===
The theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeKeyser|first=Robert M.|date=2000-12-01|title=THE ROBUSTNESS OF CRITICAL PERIOD EFFECTS IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-second-language-acquisition/article/div-classtitlethe-robustness-of-critical-period-effects-in-second-language-acquisitiondiv/6963A1AFEB8148B7F3B719D60994CD65|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=22|issue=4|pages=499–533|issn=1470-1545}}&lt;/ref&gt; has often been extended to a critical period for [[second language acquisition]] (SLA), which has influenced researchers in the field on both sides of the spectrum, supportive and unsupportive of CPH, to explore.&lt;ref name="Jia 2008"&gt;Jia, Li. "Learning a Language, Best Age." Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education. Ed. Josué M. González. Vol. 1. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2008. 520-523. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 20 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of this phenomenon has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive science]] in general for decades.

Certainly, older learners of a [[second language]] rarely achieve the native-like fluency that younger learners display, despite often progressing faster than children in the initial stages. This is generally accepted as evidence supporting the CPH. Incorporating the idea, "younger equals better" by Penfield, [[David Singleton]] (1995) states that in learning a second language there are many exceptions, noting that five percent of adult bilinguals master a second language even though they begin learning it when they are well into adulthood—long after any critical period has presumably come to a close. The critical period hypothesis holds that first language acquisition must occur before cerebral lateralization completes, at about the age of puberty. One prediction of this hypothesis is that second language acquisition is relatively fast, successful, and qualitatively similar to first language only if it occurs before the age of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=C.E.|author2=Hoefnagel-Höhle, M.|title=The Critical Period for Language Acquisition: Evidence from Second-Language Learning|journal=Child Development|date=December 1978|volume=49|issue=4|pages=1114–1128|jstor=1128751|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1978.tb04080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; To grasp a better understanding of SLA, it is essential to consider linguistic, cognitive, and social factors rather than age alone, as they are all essential to the learner's language acquisition.&lt;ref name="Jia 2008"/&gt;

Over the years, many experimenters have tried to find evidence in support or against the critical periods for&amp;nbsp;[[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition.]]&amp;nbsp;Many have found evidence that young children acquire&amp;nbsp;[[language]]&amp;nbsp;more easily than adults, but there are also special cases of adults acquiring a second language with native-like proficiency. Thus it has been difficult for researchers to separate&amp;nbsp;[[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation]]&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Causality|causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Acquisition and the Critical Period Hypothesis|last=Birdsong|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9781135674892|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Jacqueline S. Johnson and Elissa L. Newport found support for the claim that second languages are more easily acquired before&amp;nbsp;[[puberty]], or more specifically before the age of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jacqueline S|last2=Newport|first2=Elissa L|date=1989-01-01|title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=60–99|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(89)90003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested second language learners of&amp;nbsp;[[English language|English]]&amp;nbsp;who arrived in the United States at various ages ranging from three to thirty-nine, and they found that there was a decline in grammatical correctness after the age of seven. Johnson and Newport attributed this claim to a decline in language learning ability with age. Opponents of the critical period argue that the difference in language ability found by Johnson and Newport could be due to the different types of input that children and adults receive; children received reduced input while adults receive more complicated structures.

Additional evidence against a strict&amp;nbsp;critical period&amp;nbsp;is also found in the work of Pallier et al. (2003) who found that children adopted to&amp;nbsp;[[France]]&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Korea]]&amp;nbsp;were able to become native-like in their performance of&amp;nbsp;[[French language|French]]&amp;nbsp;even after the critical period for&amp;nbsp;[[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallier|first=C.|last2=Dehaene|first2=S.|last3=Poline|first3=J.-B.|last4=LeBihan|first4=D.|last5=Argenti|first5=A.-M.|last6=Dupoux|first6=E.|last7=Mehler|first7=J.|date=2003-02-01|title=Brain Imaging of Language Plasticity in Adopted Adults: Can a Second Language Replace the First?|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/13/2/155/270786/Brain-Imaging-of-Language-Plasticity-in-Adopted|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–161|doi=10.1093/cercor/13.2.155|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment may represent a special case where subjects must lose their first language in order to more perfectly acquire their second.

There is also some debate as to how one can judge the native-like quality of the speech participants produce and what exactly it means to be a near-native speaker of a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Lydia|last2=Genesee|first2=Fred|date=1996-01-01|title=How native is near-native? The issue of ultimate attainment in adult second language acquisition|jstor=43104516|journal=Second Language Research|volume=12|issue=3|pages=233–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; White et al. found that it is possible for non-native speakers of a language to become native-like in some aspects, but those aspects are influenced by their&amp;nbsp;[[first language]].

Recently, a connectionist model has been developed to explain the changes that take place in second language learning assuming that sensitive period affects lexical learning and syntactic learning parts of the system differently, which sheds further light on how first and second language acquisition changes over the course of learners development. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janciauskas|first=Marius|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2017-07-26|title=Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12519|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=42|pages=519–554|doi=10.1111/cogs.12519|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==
[[File:Ocular and Binocular.jpg|thumb|right]]
In [[mammals]], [[neurons]] in the brain that process vision actually develop after birth based on signals from the eyes. A landmark experiment by [[David H. Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] (1963) showed that cats that had one eye sewn shut from birth to three months of age ([[monocular deprivation]]) only fully developed vision in the open eye. They showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. In general electrophysiological analyses of axons and neurons in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] showed that the visual receptive field properties was comparable to adult cats. However, the layers of cortex that were deprived had less activity and fewer responses were isolated. The kittens had abnormally small [[ocular dominance columns]] (part of the brain that processes sight) connected to the closed eye, and abnormally large, wide columns connected to the open eye. Because the critical period time had elapsed, it would be impossible for the kittens to alter and develop vision in the closed eye. This did not happen to adult cats even when one eye was sewn shut for a year because they had fully developed their vision during their critical period. Later experiments in monkeys found similar results.&lt;ref name="Wiesel1963"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wiesel, TN, Hubel DH| title= Effects of visual deprivation on morphology and physiology of cell in the cat's lateral geniculate body |journal= Journal of Neurophysiology |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages= 978–993 |year= 1963 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/content/26/6/978.full |pmid= 14084170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up experiment, Hubel and Wiesel (1963) explored the cortical responses present in kittens after binocular deprivation; they found it difficult to find any active cells in the cortex, and the responses they did get were either slow-moving or fast-fatiguing. Furthermore, the cells that did respond selected for edges and bars with distinct orientation preferences.  Nevertheless, these kittens developed normal binocularity. Hubel and Wiesel first explained the mechanism, known as orientation selectivity, in the mammalian visual cortex. Orientation tuning, a model that originated with their model, is a concept in which receptive fields of neurons in the LGN excite a cortical simple cell and are arranged in rows. This model was important because it was able to describe a critical period for the proper development of normal [[ocular dominance]] columns in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], and thus able to explain the effects of [[monocular deprivation]] during this critical period.  The critical period for cats is about three months and for monkeys, about six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_rouge05.html Experiment Module: Effects of Visual Deprivation During the Critical Period for Development of Vision]. McGill University, [http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/index_a.html The Brain from Top to Bottom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar experiment, Antonini and Stryker (1993) examined the anatomical changes that can be observed after [[monocular deprivation]].  They compared geniculocortical axonal arbors in monocularly deprived animals in the long term (4- weeks) to short term (6–7 days) during the critical period established by Hubel and Wiesel (1993).  They found that in the long term, monocular deprivation causes reduced branching at the end of neurons, while the amount of afferents allocated to the nondeprived eye increased.  Even in the short term, Antonini and Stryker (1993) found that geniculocortical neurons were similarly affected.  This supports the aforementioned concept of a critical period for proper neural development for vision in the cortex.&lt;ref name= "Antonini 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Antonini A, Stryker MP |title=Rapid Remodeling of Axonal Arbors in the Visual Cortex |journal=Science |volume=260 |issue=5115 |pages= 1819–21 |date=June 1993 |jstor= 2881379 |bibcode=1993Sci...260.1819A |doi=10.1126/science.8511592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, some babies are born blind in one or both eyes, for example, due to [[cataracts]]. Even when their vision is restored later by treatment, their sight would not function in the normal way as for someone who had [[binocular vision]] from birth or had surgery to restore vision shortly after birth. Therefore, it is important to treat babies born blind soon if their condition is treatable.

Expression of the protein [[LYNX1|Lynx1]] has been associated with the normal end of the critical period for synaptic plasticity in the visual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Imprinting==
[[File:Konrad Lorenz.JPG|right|thumb|Konrad Lorenz]]
In psychology, [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is any type of rapid learning that occurs in a particular life stage. While this rapid learning is independent of the behavioral outcome, it also establishes it and can effect behavioral responses to different stimuli.  [[Konrad Lorenz]] is well known for his classic studies of filial imprinting in graylag geese. From 1935 to 1938, he presented himself to a group of newly hatched gosling and took note of how he was instantly accepted, followed, and called to as if he were the one who laid them himself.  As the first moving object they encountered, Lorenz studied the phenomenon in how quickly the geese were able to form such an irreversible [[Affectional bond|bond]].  Through his work he demonstrated that this only developed during a brief “critical period,” which was about a few hours after hatching.&lt;ref name= "Kisilevsky2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kisilevsky BS, Sylvia MJ, Xing X, Hefeung H, Hai HY, Ke Z, Zengping W |title=Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition |journal=Psychological Science |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages= 220–4 |year=2003 |pmid= 12741744 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz also discovered a long-lasting effect of his studies, and that was a shift in the species' [[sexual imprinting]] as a result from imprinting upon a foster mother of a second species. For certain species, when raised by a second one, they develop and retain imprinted preferences and approach the second species they were raised by rather than choose their own, if given a choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mertz|first1=Leslie A.|title=Imprinting and Establishment of Ethology|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3408503214&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=fcbfa43e177e9e6bd6df6584c7755813|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprinting serves as the distinguishing factor between one's own mother and other mother figures. The mother and the infant both identify with each other, this is a strong bonding moment for humans.  It provides a sort of model or guide to adult behaviors in addition to other factors such as nurture, protection in infancy, guidance, and nourishment. The imprinting process, Lorenz also found, brought about a sense of familiarity for the young animals. When such a strong bond is formed at such an early stage, it creates a sense of security and comfort for the subject and actually encourages the imprinting behavior.

[[Pheromones]] play a key role in the imprinting process, they trigger a biochemical response in the recipient, leading to a confirmed identification in the other individual. If direct contact between mother and infant is not maintained during the critical imprinting period, then the mother goose may reject the infant because she is unfamiliar with her newborn's scent. If that does happen, then the infant's life would be in jeopardy unless it were claimed by a substitute mother and if it failed to imprint would, that trigger psychological trauma, possibly leading to awkward social behavior in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hollar|first1=David Wason, Jr.|title=Imprinting|journal=Salem Health: Psychology &amp; Mental Health|volume=3|pages=980–984|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2275200294&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=253ef8de1c5a81a25244f72500a53c92|ref=Gale Virtual Refernce Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to humans, a newborn during the critical period identifies with its mother's and other peoples' scents since its scent is one of the most developed senses at that stage in life. The newborn uses this pheromone identification to seek the people it identifies with, when in times of distress, hunger, and discomfort as a survival skill.&lt;ref name="Neil J. Salkind"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Sherril M.|title=Imprinting|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3466300346&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=8430515f88ac71c0347588e1ae433b48|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=SAGE Reference|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferences could be made for newborns based upon Lorenz's studies. When imprinting on their mothers, newborns look to them for nourishment, a sense of security, and comfort. Human newborns are among the most helpless known with orangutang newborns ranking second. Newborns of these species have a very limited array of innate survival abilities. Their most important and functional ability is to form bonds with close individuals who are able to keep them alive. Imprinting is a crucial factor of the critical period because it facilitates the newborn's abilities to form bonds with other individuals, from infancy to adulthood.

==Auditory processing==
Many studies have supported a correlation between the type of auditory stimuli present in the early postnatal environment and the development on the topographical and structural development of the auditory system.&lt;ref name="Kral2013" /&gt;

First reports on critical periods came from deaf children and animals that received a [[cochlear implant]] to restore hearing. Approximately at the same time, both an electroencephalographic study by Sharma, Dorman and Spahr &lt;ref name= "Sharma2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma A, Dorman MF, Spahr AJ |title= A sensitive period for the development of the central auditory system in children with cochlear implants: implications for age of implantation. |journal= Ear Hear |volume= 23 |pages=532–29 |year= 2002 |doi=10.1097/00003446-200212000-00004 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an in-vivo investigation of the cortical plasticity in deaf cats by Kral and colleagues &lt;ref name= "Kral2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kral A, Harmann R, Tillein J, Heid S, Klinke R |title= Hearing after congenital deafness: central auditory plasticity in deafness |journal= Cerebral Cortex |volume= 12 |issue=8 | pages=797–807 |year= 2002 |pmid=12122028 |doi= 10.1093/cercor/12.8.797}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the adaptation to the cochlear implant is subject to an early, developmental sensitive period. The closure of sensitive periods likely involves a multitude of processes that in their combination make it difficult to reopen these behaviorally.&lt;ref name="Kral2013" /&gt; The understanding of the mechanisms behind critical periods has consequences for medical therapy of hearing loss.&lt;ref name= "Kral2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kral A, Sharma A |title= Developmental neuroplasticity after cochlear implantation. |journal= Trends in Neurosciences |volume= 35 |pages=111–122 |year= 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2011.09.004 |pmid=22104561 |pmc=3561718 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; M. Merzenich and colleagues showed that during an early critical period, noise exposure can affect the frequency organization of the auditory cortex.&lt;ref name= "Nakahara2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nakahara |title= Specialization of primary auditory cortex processing by sound exposure in the "critical period" |journal= PNAS |volume= 101 |issue=18 | pages=7170–7174 |year= 2004|display-authors=etal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401196101 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.7170N |pmc=406484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have examined the possibility of a critical period for thalamocortical connectivity in the auditory system.  For example, Zhou and Merzenich (2008) studied the effects of noise on development in the primary auditory cortex in rats.  In their study, rats were exposed to pulsed noise during the critical period and the effect on cortical processing was measured.  Rats that were exposed to pulsed noise during the critical period had cortical neurons that were less able to respond to repeated stimuli; the early auditory environment interrupted normal structural organization during development.

In a related study, Barkat, Polley and Hensch (2011) looked at how exposure to different sound frequencies influences the development of the tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex and the ventral medical geniculate body.  In this experiment, mice were reared either in normal environments or in the presence of 7&amp;nbsp;kHz tones during early postnatal days.  They found that mice that were exposed to an abnormal auditory environment during a critical period P11- P15 had an atypical tonotopic map in the primary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name= "Barkat2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barkat TR, Polley DB, Hensch TK |title= A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity |journal= Nature Neuroscience |volume= 14 |issue= 9 |pages=1189–96 |date=September 2011 |url= http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n9/abs/nn.2882.html?lang=en?WT.ec_id=NEURO-201109 |doi=10.1038/nn.2882 |pmid=21804538 |pmc=3419581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These studies support the notion that exposure to certain sounds within the critical period can influence the development of tonotopic maps and the response properties of neurons. Critical periods are important for the development of the brain for the function from a pattern of connectivity.  In general, the early auditory environment influences the structural development and response specificity of the primary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Zhou2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou X, Merzenich MM |title=Enduring Effects of early structured noise exposure on temporal modulation in the primary auditory cortex |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=11 |pages=4423–8 |year=1993 |url=http://www.pnas.org_cgi_doi_10.1073_pnas.0800009105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.4423Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.0800009105 |pmid=18332439 |pmc=2393777 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical ability===

{{main|Absolute pitch}}

[[Absolute pitch]] manifests itself almost always before adolescence and rarely if ever among individuals who are first exposed to music after mid-childhood, suggesting that exposure to music or similar phenomena (''e.g.'', tonal languages) in early to mid-childhood is a necessary condition for its development or refinement.  Studies that ask musicians and non-musicians to sing or hum well-known popular songs that have definitive recordings (and hence are sung in standardized keys) show that—on average—participants sing within a semitone of the standardized key but that outside the small subset of participants with absolute pitch there is broad variation (the "bell curve" that reflects the degree of approximation to the standard key is broad and flat).{{rn|date=April 2016}}  These results suggest that almost all humans have some innate aptitude for absolute pitch recognition—though other factors may enhance or limit the level of that aptitude. Also, the results' conjunction with the aforementioned chronological observations suggests that early to mid-childhood exposure to environments whose interpretation depends on pitch is a developmental "trigger" for whatever aptitude an individual possesses.

==Vestibular system==
In our [[vestibular system]], neurons are undeveloped at neuronal birth and mature during the critical period of the first 2-3 postnatal weeks.  Hence, disruption of maturation during this period can cause changes in normal balance and movement through space.  Animals with abnormal vestibular development tend to have irregular motor skills.&lt;ref name="Eugéne2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eugéne D, Deforges S, Vibert N, Vidal PP |title= Vestibular Critical Period, Maturation of Central Vestibular Neurons, and Locomotor Control |journal= Basic and Clinical Aspects of Vertigo and Dizziness |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03727.x |volume=1164 |issue=1 |pages=180–187|bibcode=2009NYASA1164..180E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have consistently shown that animals with genetic vestibular deficiencies during this critical period have altered vestibular [[phenotype]]s, most likely as a result of lack insufficient input from the semicircular canals and [[dopaminergic]] abnormalities.  Moreover, exposure to abnormal vestibular stimuli during the critical period is associated with irregular motor development. Children with hypofunctioning vestibular receptors frequently have delayed motor development. The results of the studies done on ferrets and rats reinforced the idea that the vestibular system is very important to motor development during the initial neonatal period. If the vestibular receptors are present during the initial six months to a year when the infant is learning to sit and stand, then the child may develop motor control and balance normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Cleave|first1=S|title=A critical period for the impact of vestibular sensation on ferret motor development|pmc=2034323|pmid=17538206|volume=16|pages=179–86|journal=J Vestib Res}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement. It produces an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. Studies in fish and amphibians revealed a sensitivity in their VOR. They launched into space flight for 9-10, some with developing VOR's and others with already developed reflexes. The fish with developing reflexes developed an upward bend in their tails. The altered gravity resulted in a shift of orientation. Those who were already matured with the reflex were insensitive to the microgravity exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein-Allee|first1=Albert|title="Critical periods" in vestibular development or adaptation of gravity sensory systems to altered gravitational conditions?|journal=University of Ulm|pmid=15260375|volume=142|pages=155–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
Recent studies also support the possibility of a critical period for the development of neurons that mediate memory processing.  Experimental evidence supports the notion that young neurons in the adult dentate gyrus have a critical period (about 1–3 weeks after neuronal birth) during which they are integral to memory formation.&lt;ref name= "Aasebø 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aasebø, IEJ |title= Critical maturational period of new neuron in adult dentate gyrus for their involvement in memory formation |journal= European Journal of Neuroscience |volume= 33 |pages=1094–1100 |year= 2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07608.x |last2= Blankvoort |first2= Stefan |last3= Tashiro |first3= Ayumu |issue= 6 |pmid= 21395853}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although the exact reasoning behind this observation is uncertain, studies suggest that the functional properties of neurons at this age make them most appropriate for this purpose; these neurons: (1) Remain hyperactive during the formation of memories; (2) are more excitable; and (3) More easily depolarizable due to GABAergic effects. It is also possible that hyperplasticity makes the neurons more useful in memory formation. If these young neurons had more plasticity than adult neurons in the same context, they could be more influential in smaller numbers.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;
The role of these neurons in the adult dentate gyrus in memory processing is further supported by the fact that behavioral experiments have shown that an intact dentate gyrus is integral to hippocampal memory formation.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;   It is speculated that the dentate gyrus acts a relay station for information relating to memory storage.  The likelihood of a critical period could change the way we view memory processing because it would ultimately mean that the collection of neurons present is constantly being replenished as new neurons replace old ones. If a critical period does indeed exist, this could possibly mean that: (1) Diverse populations of neurons that represent events occurring soon after one another may connect those events temporally in the memory formation and processing; OR (2) These different populations of neurons may distinguish between similar events, independent of temporal position; OR (3) Separate populations may mediate the formation of new memories when the same events occur frequently.&lt;ref name="Aasebø 2011"/&gt;

==Sports==
In physical sports, humans need several years of practice before reaching the highest competitive level. To date, no single professional football or basketball player has been able to play in the best leagues after starting practice at age 20. The same applies to mental sports like chess, where no player has arrived to the top 100 after starting practice at age 20. In general, to reach the highest level in sport, the sooner a person start to train, the best.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

{{For|the legal doctrine|Judicial deference}}
{{hatnote|"Deferential" and "Submission" redirect here. Not to be confused with [[Difference (disambiguation)]] or [[Differential (disambiguation)]].}}
{{redirect-distinguish|Reverence (attitude)|Reverence (emotion)}}
'''Deference''' (also called '''submission''' or '''passivity''') is the condition of submitting to the espoused, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] influence of one's superior or superiors.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Kirbya, "Early American Politics—The Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'" ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808–838&lt;/ref&gt; Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by [[political scientists]], sociologists, and psychologists.

==Politics==
Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the "colonial speech economy," that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Smolenski, "From Men of Property to Just Men," ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay "The Nature of Deference and Demeanor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.

==Psychology==
There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.

In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7073">The concept of a biological [[species]] as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding to produce viable offspring dates back to at least the 18th century, although it is often associated today with [[Ernst Mayr]].  Species of the fruit-fly ''[[Drosophila]]'' are one of the most commonly used organisms in evolutionary research, and have been used to test many theories related to the evolution of species.  The [[genus]] ''Drosophila'' comprises numerous species that have varying degrees of premating and postmating isolation (including hybrid sterility) between them.  These species are useful for testing hypotheses of the reproductive mechanisms underlying [[speciation]].

== Historical background ==

Working in the early 20th century [[T.H. Morgan]], was the first to use ''Drosophila'' to explore heredity.  Primarily on the basis of work with ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', Morgan and his colleagues C.B. Bridges, A.H. Sturtevant, and H.J. Mueller developed a chromosome theory of heredity, for which Morgan was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1933.  Their experiments consisted of cross-breeding ''Drosophila'' mutants and documenting offspring.  Another highly regarded figure in ''Drosophila'' research was Theodosius [[Dobzhansky]], who invented the use of genetic markers and used them to study [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[sterility (physiology)|sterility]] between ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosophila persimilis'' (Futuyma 1997).  This experimental method has been used for many years.

== Gender determination in ''Drosophila'' ==

The [[genome]] of ''D. melanogaster'', has been sequenced and studied in fine detail.  It is now known that ''Drosophila'' has 6 chromosomes—an X/Y pair and four [[autosomal]] chromosomes.  The genome comprises about 139.5 million base pairs.  There are about 15,000 genes.

Gender is determined in ''Drosophila'' not by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome as in mammals, but by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes.

== Experimentation ==

In the off-spring of crosses between ''Drosophila simulans'' and its island derivative ''Drosophila mauritiana,'' female hybrids are fertile but male hybrids are sterile.  Recent studies have shown that a critical gene for gender determination in ''Drosophila'' known as the sex-lethal gene is highly misregulated in ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' hybrids, compared with the degree of misregulation of non-sex biased genes studied.  The sex-lethal gene is often abnormally expressed in male hybrids from ''D. melanogaster'' mothers as a result of re-localization of the male-specific complex to the X chromosome, which contributes to the male sterility.  Abnormalities in sperm array were found in very few individuals during their larval stage, meaning that disruptions in [[spermatogenesis]] most likely occur during later stages in life. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Experiments involving crosses between ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. bipectinata'', ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. parabipectinata'', and ''D. pseudoananassae'' and ''D. malerkotliana'' have further shown that the Y chromosome has a role in hybrid male sterility.  The possible interactions of Y chromosome are X-Y, Y-autosome and Y-cytoplasm (Paras 2006).  The sterile males carry a set of conspecific autosomes to the Y chromosome, which results in fertility because of the Y-dominant autosome interactions.  Therefore, Y-autosome interactions are ruled out in this type of hybrid sterility.

Since cytoplasmic factors can be compatible between these species (Reference needed), such factors are also dismissed as the cause of sterility.

However, in ''Drosophila paulistorum'' there is information suggesting that if Y chromosome and cytoplasm are from different parents, the male is usually sterile. (Perez-Salas &amp; Ehrman 1971) X-Y interactions are the most likely cause of sterility in male hybrids.  It has been shown that interbreeding organisms that have more genetic compatibilities have less disruption of [[spermatogenesis]] and normal sized testes, while species who are less genetically compatible have a higher disruption in spermatogenesis and generally have atrophied testes. (Reference needed)

Another possible cause of sterility among species in which presence or absence of one or the other sex chromosome determines gender, is if one sex chromosome of one species has recessive alleles interacting with autosomal alleles of the mating species.  This could cause the heterogametic sex chromosome in the hybrid to be inviable or sterile, but homogametic sex chromosome will be fertile (Futuyma 1997).  Consequently, in species where presence or absence of a Y chromosome determines gender, for instance, individuals carrying XY chromosomes (males) will be sterile and those carrying XX (females) will be fertile.  This is closely related to [[Haldane's rule]].

It has also been shown that microbial infections of invertebrates can cause modification of the gender and fertility of host's off-spring. For instance, infections of nematodes or of arthropods, including Drosophila, species of the rickettsial bacteria [[Wolbachia]] can produce a male-specific sterility, which is congenital by means of transmission through the female line.

== Controversy ==

Experiments have led scientists to believe that many observations recorded in laboratories neglect existing [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] factors in hybrid sterility due to crossing parents from non-isofemale lines, as well as possibly underestimating actual degrees of sterility caused by inaccurate measures of [[motility]].  (Reference needed) Failure to account for potential polymorphism could lead to misinterpretation of the scale on which hybrid sterility occurs.

{{medref|date=July 2014}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] can be classified into two types: [[ionizing radiation]] and [[non-ionizing radiation]], based on the capability of a single [[photon]] with more than 10&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] energy to ionize oxygen or break [[chemical bond]]s. [[Ultraviolet]] and higher frequencies, such as [[X-ray]]s or [[gamma ray]]s are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see ''[[radiation]]'' and ''[[radiation poisoning]]''. By far the most common health hazard of radiation is [[sunburn]], which causes over one million new skin cancers annually.&lt;ref name=Cleaver /&gt;

==Types of hazards==

===Electrical hazards===
Very strong radiation can induce current capable of delivering an electric shock to persons or animals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It can also overload and destroy electrical equipment. The induction of currents by oscillating magnetic fields is also the way in which solar storms disrupt the operation of electrical and electronic systems, causing damage to and even the explosion of power distribution transformers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/storms.html|title=Solar Storms and You: Human Impacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; blackouts (as occurred in [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|1989]]), and interference with electromagnetic signals (''e.g.'' radio, TV, and telephone signals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/podcasts/media/Blackout/Blackout_part4.htm Transcript of "Blackout: The Sun-Earth Connection", Part 4: When Solar Plasma Distorts Earth's Magnetic Field]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I don't have time to do research to find another, more stable reference, such as from a scientific journal or textbook, but these one from NASA cover the subject with, I think, adequate authority to justify the sentence. --&gt;

===Fire hazards===
Extremely high power electromagnetic radiation can cause electric currents strong enough to create sparks (electrical arcs) when an induced voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]] of the surrounding medium (''e.g.'' air at 3.0 MV/m). These sparks can then ignite flammable materials or gases, possibly leading to an explosion.

This can be a particular hazard in the vicinity of [[explosives]] or [[pyrotechnics]], since an electrical overload might ignite them. This risk is commonly referred to as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) by the [[United States Navy]] (USN). [[United States Military Standard]] 464A (MIL-STD-464A) mandates assessment of HERO in a system, but USN document OD 30393 provides design principles and practices for controlling electromagnetic hazards to ordnance.&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|title= Acquisition Safety - Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Hazards|publisher= Naval Safety Center - United States Navy|accessdate= 2014-07-30|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140808041218/http://www.public.navy.mil/comnavsafecen/Pages/acquisition/radio_frequency-radiation.aspx|archivedate= 2014-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the risk related to fueling is known as Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF). NAVSEA OP 3565 Vol. 1 could be used to evaluate HERF, which states a maximum power density of 0.09&amp;nbsp;W/m² for frequencies under 225&amp;nbsp;MHz (i.e. 4.2 meters for a 40&amp;nbsp;W emitter).&lt;ref name="comnavsafecen" /&gt;

===Biological hazards===
{{see also|Mobile phone radiation and health#Non-thermal effects}}
The best understood biological effect of electromagnetic fields is to cause [[dielectric heating]]. For example, touching or standing around an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] while a high-power [[transmitter]] is in operation can cause severe burns. These are exactly the kind of burns that would be caused inside a [[microwave oven]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

This heating effect varies with the power and the [[frequency]] of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the distance to the source. A measure of the heating effect is the [[specific absorption rate]] or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The [[IEEE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = Standard for Safety Level with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3KHz to 300GHz  | journal = IEEE Std  | volume = C95.1-2005&lt;!--Should this be appended here?:" - IEEE"--&gt;  | issue =  | pages =  | publisher = IEEE  | date = October 2005  | url = https://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/C95.1-2005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on [[Specific absorption rate|SAR]], mainly based on [http://www.icnirp.de ICNIRP] Guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection |title=Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields (up to 300 GHz) |journal=Health Physics |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=494–522 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9525427 |url=http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113052702/http://www.icnirp.de/documents/emfgdl.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which guard against thermal damage.

There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker ''non-thermal'' electromagnetic fields (see [[Bioelectromagnetics]]), including weak ELF magnetic fields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delgado JM, Leal J, Monteagudo JL, Gracia MG |title=Embryological changes induced by weak, extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=533–51 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7107514 |pmc=1167891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harland JD, Liburdy RP |title=Environmental magnetic fields inhibit the antiproliferative action of tamoxifen and melatonin in a human breast cancer cell line |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=555–62 |year=1997 |pmid=9383244 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1997)18:8&lt;555::AID-BEM4&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modulated RF and microwave fields.&lt;ref name="Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO 2006 885–90"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aalto S, Haarala C, Brück A, Sipilä H, Hämäläinen H, Rinne JO |title=Mobile phone affects cerebral blood flow in humans |journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=885–90 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16495939 |doi=10.1038/sj.jcbfm.9600279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599|title=Microwave frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression|last=Pal|first=Martin|date=2016|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.jchemneu.2015.08.001|volume=75|journal=Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy|pages=43–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal levels are not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Binhi|first= Vladimir N|others= Repiev, A &amp; Edelev, M (translators from Russian)|title= Magnetobiology: underlying physical problems |publisher= Academic Press|location= San Diego|year= 2002|pages= 1–16|isbn= 978-0-12-100071-4|oclc= 49700531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent lighting==
[[Fluorescent light]] bulbs and tubes internally produce [[ultraviolet]] light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the [[phosphor]] film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mironava|first=T. |author2=Hadjiargyrou, M. |author3=Simon, M. |author4=Rafailovich, M.

==EMR effects on the human body by frequency==
[[File:For Your Own Health (13942406865) (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Warning sign next to a transmitter with high field strengths]]

While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Extremely-low frequency===
High-power, [[extremely low frequency|extremely-low-frequency]] RF with electric field levels in the low kV/m range are known to induce perceivable currents within the human body that create an annoying tingling sensation. These currents will typically flow to ground through a body contact surface such as the feet, or arc to ground where the body is well insulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/elf_ehc/en/index.html Extremely Low Frequency Fields Environmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238], chapter 5, page 121, WHO&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shortwave===
[[Shortwave]] (1.6 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) [[diathermy]] heating of human tissue only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as [[blood vessels]] and [[muscle]]. [[Adipose tissue]] (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html ReBound shortwave diathermy (SWD)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209130604/http://www.regearlife.com/therapeutic-heating-system-uses-shortwave-diathermy.html |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio frequency fields===

This designation of mobile phone signals as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) (e.g. its IARC, see below) has often been misinterpreted as indicating that of some measure of risk has been observed{{snd}} however the designation indicates only that the possibility could not be conclusively ruled out using the available data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cell phones, cancer, and children |author1=Boice JD Jr |author2=Tarone RE |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=16 |pages=1211–3 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djr285 |pmid=21795667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)]] classified mobile phone radiation as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] "possibly carcinogenic" (''rather than'' [[List of IARC Group 2A carcinogens|Group 2A]] "probably carcinogenic" nor the "is carcinogenic" Group 1). That means that there "could be some risk" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.&lt;ref name="WHO_IARC_110531"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf |format= PDF|title= IARC classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans |work=press release N° 208 |publisher=[[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] concluded in 2014 that "A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones - Fact sheet N°193 |publisher= World Health Organization |date=October 2014 |accessdate= 2 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euitt.upm.es/estaticos/catedra-coitt/web_salud_medioamb/Informes/informes_PDF/rf/HealthCanada/99ehd237.pdf Limits of Human Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields in the Frequency Range from 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 300&amp;nbsp;GHz], Canada Safety Code 6, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millimeter waves===
Recent technology advances in the developments of [[millimeter wave scanner]]s for [[airport security]] and [[WiGig]] for [[personal area network]]s have opened the 60&amp;nbsp;GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations.  Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure. Radiation levels in the millimeter wavelength represent the high microwave band or close to Infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieice.org/proceedings/EMC09/pdf/22S1-1.pdf Characterization of 60GHz Millimeter-Wave Focusing Beam for Living-Body Exposure Experiments, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Masaki KOUZAI et al., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrared===
[[Infrared]] wavelengths longer than 750&amp;nbsp;nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. [[Glassblower's cataract]] is an example of a heat injury that damages the [[anterior lens]] capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for many hours a day.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
 
Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of [[arc welding]], infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does.  This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Visible light===
Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the [[retina]] of the eye, or even the [[skin]]. To control the risk of injury, various specifications &amp;ndash; for example ANSI Z136 in the US, and IEC 60825 internationally &amp;ndash; define "classes" of lasers depending on their power and wavelength.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see [[laser safety]]).

As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary [[flash blindness]].  Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.&lt;ref name=TWI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/health-and-safety-faqs/faq-what-is-the-minimum-safe-distance-from-the-welding-arc-above-which-there-is-no-risk-of-eye-damage/ |title=What is the minimum safe distance from the welding arc above which there is no risk of eye damage? |publisher=The Welding Institute (TWI Global) |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet===
Short-term exposure to strong ultraviolet sunlight causes [[sunburn]] within hours of exposure.

Ultraviolet light, specifically [[UV-B]], has been shown to cause [[cataracts]] and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sliney DH |title=UV radiation ocular exposure dosimetry |journal=Doc Ophthalmol |volume=88 |issue=3–4 |pages=243–54 |year=1994 |pmid=7634993 |doi=10.1007/bf01203678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rafnsson | first = V |author2=Olafsdottir E |author3=Hrafnkelsson J |author4=Sasaki H |author5=Arnarsson A |author6=Jonasson F  | title = Cosmic radiation increases the risk of nuclear cataract in airline pilots: a population-based case-control study | journal = Arch Ophthalmol | volume = 123 | pages = 1102–5 | doi = 10.1001/archopht.123.8.1102 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087845 | issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hypothesized that [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the ozone layer]] and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts.&lt;ref name="Dobson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| last1 = Dobson| title = Ozone depletion will bring big rise in number of cataracts| journal = BMJ| volume = 331| issue = 7528| pages = 1292–1295| year = 2005| pmid = | pmc = 1298891 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7528.1292-d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the lens filters UV light, so once that is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.&lt;ref name=Komarnitsky&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.komar.org/faq/colorado-cataract-surgery-crystalens/ultra-violet-color-glow/ |title=Case study of ultraviolet vision after IOL removal for Cataract Surgery |author=Komarnitsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]] can lead to [[melanoma]] and other skin malignancies.&lt;ref name=Cleaver&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Cleaver JE, Mitchell DL |veditors=Bast RC, Kufe DW, Pollock RE | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 5th | publisher = B.C.

In addition to sunlight, other sources include [[tanning beds]], and bright desk lights.  Damage is cumulative over one's lifetime, so that permanent effects may not be evident for some time after exposure.&lt;ref name=UVAware&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvawareness.com/uv-info/uv-exposure.php |title=UV Exposure &amp; Your Health |publisher=UV Awareness |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|actinic rays]]) can damage the [[corneal epithelium]].  This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand.  UV generated by a [[welding]] arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as "arc eye" or welding flash burn, a form of [[photokeratitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/799025-overview|publisher=Medscape|title=Ultraviolet keratitis|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔθνος}} ''ethnos'' "folk, people, nation" and {{lang|grc|γράφω}} ''grapho'' "I write") is the systematic study of people and cultures. It is designed to explore [[cultural]] phenomena where the researcher observes society from the point of view of the subject of the study.  An ethnography is a means to represent graphically and in writing the culture of a [[ethnic group|group]].  The word can thus be said to have a double meaning, which partly depends on whether it is used as a [[count noun]] or uncountable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanethnography.com/ethnography.php "Technical definition of ethnography"], ''American Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting field study or a case report reflects the knowledge and the system of meanings in the lives of a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1973). [[Thick description]]: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (pp. 3-30). New York: Basic Books, Inc., Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipsen, G. (1992). ''Speaking Culturally: Explorations in Social Communication.'' Albany, New York: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a method of data collection ethnography entails examining the behaviour of the participants in a certain specific social situation and also understanding their interpretation of such behaviour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewan (2018) further elaborates that this behaviour may be shaped by the constraints the participants feel because of the situations they are in or by the society in which they belong. Ethnography, as the presentation of [[empirical]] data on human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s, was pioneered in the biological, social, and cultural branches of [[anthropology]], but it has also become popular in the [[social sciences]] in general—[[sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethnology "Ethnology" at ''dictionary.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; communication studies, history—wherever people study ethnic groups, formations, compositions, resettlements, social welfare characteristics, materiality, spirituality, and a people's [[ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Токарев |first=Сергей Александрович |coauthors= |script-title=ru:История зарубежной этнографии |publisher=Наука |year=1978 |url=http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |isbn= |language=Russian |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519225912/http://historia-site.narod.ru/library/ethnology/tokarev_main.htm |archive-date=2003-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical ethnography is a [[holistic]] study&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"&gt;Ember, Carol and Melvin Ember, ''Cultural Anthropology'' (Prentice Hall, 2006), chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"&gt;Heider, Karl. ''Seeing Anthropology''. 2001. Prentice Hall, Chapters One and Two.&lt;/ref&gt; and so includes a brief history, and an analysis of the [[Physical geography|terrain]], the [[climate]], and the [[habitat]].  In all cases, it should be reflexive, make a substantial contribution toward the understanding of the social life of humans, have an aesthetic impact on the reader, and express a credible reality. An ethnography records all observed behavior and describes all symbol-meaning relations, using concepts that avoid causal explanations. Traditionally, ethnography was focussed on the western gaze towards the far 'exotic' east, but now researchers are undertaking ethnography in their own social environment. According to Dewan (2018), even if we are the other, the ‘another’ or the ‘native’, we are still ‘another’ because there are many facades of ourselves that connect us to people and other facades that highlight our differences. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==History and meaning==
[[File:Sahagun.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bernardino de Sahagún]] is known as the first modern ethnographer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43462|title=Bernardino de Sahagun: First Anthropologist (review)|first=Louise M.|last=Burkhart|date=10 June 2003|publisher=|journal=The Catholic Historical Review|volume=89|issue=2|pages=351–352|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/cat.2003.0100}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
The word 'ethnography' is derived from the Greek ἔθνος (''ethnos''), meaning "a company, later a people, nation" and [[-graphy]], meaning "writing". Ethnographic studies focus on large cultural groups of people who interact over time. Ethnography is a set of qualitative methods that are used in social sciences that focus on the observation of social practices and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erialproject.org/for-librarians/what-is-ethnography|title=What is Ethnography? « ERIAL Project|website=www.erialproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to observe a situation without imposing any deductive structure or framework upon it and to view everything as strange or unique.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Preece, J., Sharp, H., &amp; Rogers, Y. (2015). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction (4th edition). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of anthropology originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.&amp;nbsp;B. Tylor]] (1832–1917) from Britain and [[Lewis H. Morgan]] (1818–1881), an American scientist were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. [[Franz Boas]] (1858–1942), [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] (1884—1942), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948), and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of [[cultural relativism]] to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and this became the origin of field work and field methods.

Since Malinowski was very firm with his approach he applied it practically and traveled to [[Trobriand Islands]] which are located off the eastern coast of [[New Guinea]]. He was interested in learning the language of the islanders and stayed there for a long time doing his field work. The field of ethnography became very popular in the late 19th century, as many social scientists gained an interest in studying modern society.  Again, in the latter part of the 19th century, the field of anthropology became a good support for scientific formation.  Though the field was flourishing, it had a lot of threats to encounter. Postcolonialism, the research climate shifted towards post-modernism and feminism. Therefore, the field of anthropology moved into a discipline of social science.

==Origins==
[[Gerhard Friedrich Müller]] developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]] (1733–43) as a professor of history and geography. Whilst involved in the expedition, he differentiated ''Völker-Beschreibung'' as a distinct area of study. This became known as "ethnography," following the introduction of the Greek neologism ''ethnographia''  by Johann Friedrich Schöpperlin and the German variant by A. F. Thilo in 1767.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] and [[Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Vermeulen, Han F., 2008, ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment'', Leiden, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermeulen"&gt;{{cite book|last = Vermeulen|first = Hans|title = Early History of Ethnograph and Ethnolog in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710-1808|year = 2008|publisher = Privately published|location = Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], known as the Father of History, had significant works on the cultures of various peoples beyond the Hellenic realm such as the [[Scythians]], which earned him the title "philobarbarian", and may be said to have produced the first works of ethnography.

==Forms of ethnography==

There are different forms of ethnography: confessional ethnography; life history; feminist ethnography etc. Two popular forms of ethnography are realist ethnography and critical ethnography. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Realist ethnography is a traditional approach used by cultural anthropologists. Characterized by Van Maanen (1988), it reflects a particular instance taken by the researcher toward the individual being studied. It's an objective study of the situation. It's composed from a third person's perspective by getting the data from the members on the site. The ethnographer stays as omniscient correspondent of actualities out of sight. The realist reports information in a measured style ostensibly uncontaminated by individual predisposition, political objectives, and judgment. The analyst will give a detailed report of the everyday life of the individuals under study. The ethnographer also uses standard categories for cultural description (e.g., family life, communication network). The ethnographer produces the participant's views through closely edited quotations and has the final work on how the culture is to be interpreted and presented. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 93)

Critical ethnography is a kind of ethnographic research in which the creators advocate for the liberation of groups which are marginalized in society. Critical researchers typically are politically minded people who look to take a stand of opposition to inequality and domination.  For example, a critical ethnographer might study schools that provide privileges to certain types of students, or counseling practices that serve to overlook the needs of underrepresented groups. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94). The important components of a critical ethnographer are to incorporate a value- laden introduction, empower people by giving them more authority, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control. A critical ethnographer will study issues of power, empowerment, inequality inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony, and victimization. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)

==Features of ethnographic research==
According to Dewan (2018) the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings; rather, they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation. In this regard, the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions &lt;ref&gt;(Dewan M. (2018) Understanding Ethnography: An ‘Exotic’ Ethnographer’s Perspective. In: Mura P., Khoo-Lattimore C. (eds) Asian Qualitative Research in Tourism. Perspectives on Asian Tourism. Springer, Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Involves investigation of very few cases, maybe just one case, in detail.
* Often involves working with primarily unconstructed data. This data had not been coded at the point of data collection in terms of a closed set of analytic categories.
* Emphasizes on exploring social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses.
* Data analysis involves interpretation of the functions and meanings of human actions. The product of this is mainly verbal explanations, where statistical analysis and quantification play a subordinate role. 
* Methodological discussions focus more on questions about how to report findings in the field than on methods of data collection and interpretation.
* Ethnographies focus on describing the culture of a group in very detailed and complex manner. The ethnography can be of the entire group or a subpart of it. 
* It involves engaging in extensive field work where data collection is mainly by interviews, symbols, artifacts, observations, and many other sources of data. 
* The researcher in ethnography type of research looks for patterns of the group's mental activities, that is their ideas and beliefs expressed through language or other activities, and how they behave in their groups as expressed through their actions that the researcher observed.
* In ethnography, the researcher gathers what is available, what is normal, what it is that people do, what they say, and how they work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Procedures for conducting ethnography==

* Determine if ethnography is the most appropriate design to use to study the research problem. Ethnography is suitable if the needs are to describe how a cultural group works and to explore their beliefs, language, behaviours and also issues faced by the group, such as power, resistance, and dominance. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
*  Then identify and locate a culture-sharing group to study.  This group is one whose members have been together for an extended period of time, so that their shared language, patterns of behaviour and attitudes have merged into discernible patterns. This group can also be a group that has been marginalized by society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94)
* Select cultural themes, issues or theories to study about the group. These themes, issues, and theories provide an orienting framework for the study of the culture-sharing group. As discussed by [[Martyn Hammersley|Hammersley]] and Atkinson (2007), Wolcott (1987, 1994b, 2008-1), and Fetterman (2009). The ethnographer begins the study by examining people in interaction in ordinary settings and discerns pervasive patterns such as life cycles, events, and cultural themes. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 94-95)
* For studying cultural concepts, determine which type of ethnography to use. Perhaps how the group works need to be described, or a critical ethnography can expose issues such as power, hegemony, and advocacy for certain groups (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
* Should collect information in the context or setting where the group works or lives. This is called fieldwork. Types of information typically needed in ethnography are collected by going to the research site, respecting the daily lives of individuals at the site and collecting a wide variety of materials. Field issues of respect, reciprocity, deciding who owns the data and others are central to Ethnography (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 95)
*  From the many sources collected, the ethnographer analyzes the data for a description of the culture-sharing group, themes that emerge from the group and an overall interpretation (Wolcott, 1994b). The researcher begins to compile a detailed description of the culture-sharing group, by focusing on a single event, on several activities, or on the group over a prolonged period of time.
*   Forge a working set of rules or generalizations as to how the culture-sharing group works as the final product of this analysis. The final product is a holistic cultural portrait of the group that incorporates the views of the participants (emic) as well as the views of the researcher (etic). It might also advocate for the needs of the group or suggest changes in society. (Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, 96)

==Ethnography as method==
The ethnographic method is different from other ways of conducting social science approach due to the following reasons:
[[File:Rozmowa z twórczyniami tradycyjnych, wołoskich pisanek.jpg|thumb|An ethnographer conducting field interviews, [[Wallachian Open Air Museum|Valašské muzeum v přírodě]]]]
* It is field-based. It is conducted in the settings in which real people actually live, rather than in laboratories where the researcher controls the elements of the behaviors to be observed or measured.
* It is personalized. It is conducted by researchers who are in the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the people they are studying and who are thus both participants in and observers of the lives under study.
* It is multifactorial. It is conducted through the use of two or more data collection techniques - which may be qualitative or quantitative in nature - in order to get a conclusion.
* It requires a long-term commitment i.e. it is conducted by a researcher who intends to interact with people they are studying for an extended period of time.  The exact time frame can vary from several weeks to a year or more.
* It is inductive. It is conducted in such a way to use an accumulation of descriptive detail to build toward general patterns or explanatory theories rather than structured to test hypotheses derived from existing theories or models.
* It is dialogic.  It is conducted by a researcher whose interpretations and findings may be expounded on by the study’s participants while conclusions are still in the process of formulation.
* It is holistic. It is conducted so as to yield the fullest possible portrait of the group under study.
* It can also be used in other methodological frameworks, for instance, an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the leading social scientist, [[John David Brewer|John Brewer]], data collection methods are meant to capture the "social meanings and ordinary activities"&lt;ref name="brewer"&gt;[Brewer, John D. (2000). ''Ethnography.'' Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.10.]&lt;/ref&gt; of people (informants) in "naturally occurring settings"&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt; that are commonly referred to as "the field."  The goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data.&lt;ref name="brewer" /&gt;  Multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community.  These can include participant observation, field notes, interviews, and surveys.

Interviews are often taped and later transcribed, allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking, but with all information available later for full analysis. Secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic.  In the past, kinship charts were commonly used to "discover logical patterns and social structure in non-Western societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/kinship.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed.

In order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent, researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be "reflexive". Reflexivity refers to the researcher's aim "to explore the ways in which [the] researcher's involvement with a particular study influences, acts upon and informs such research".&lt;ref&gt;[Nightingale, David &amp; Cromby, John. ''Social Constructionist Psychology: A Critical Analysis of Theory and Practice''. Philadelphia: Open University Press. p.228.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these attempts of reflexivity, no researcher can be totally unbiased. This factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography.

Traditionally, the ethnographer focuses attention on a community, selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garson |first=G. David |url=http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/ethno.htm |title=Ethnographic Research: Statnotes, from North Carolina State University, Public Administration Program |publisher=Faculty.chass.ncsu.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community, often using snowball or chain sampling.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; This process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied.&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt; Ethnography relies greatly on up-close, personal experience. Participation, rather than just observation, is one of the keys to this process.&lt;ref&gt;Genzuk, Michael, PH.D., ''[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~genzuk/Ethnographic_Research.html A Synthesis of Ethnographic]'', Center for Multilingual, Multicultural Research, University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnography is very useful in social research.

Ybema et al. (2010) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography.  Ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective, in which behavior is observed, to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects. Research can range from an objectivist account of fixed, observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing "the interplay of individual agency and social structure."&lt;ref&gt;S. Ybema, D. Yanow, H. Wels, &amp; F. Kamsteeg (2010). "Ethnography." In A. Mills, G. Durepos, &amp; E. Wiebe (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Case Study Research.'' (pp. 348-352). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theory researchers address "issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power."

Another form of data collection is that of the "image." The image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea. An image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual's perspective, primarily based on that individual’s past experiences. One example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it. The physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of "I can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barry|first1=Lynda|title=Lynda Barry: The answer is in the picture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmT4wLWksOw|website=YouTube|publisher=INKtalks|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner. Effectively, the idea of the image is a primary tool for ethnographers to collect data. The image presents the perspective, experiences, and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence, the individual will always contain this image in the group under study.

== Differences across disciplines ==
The ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines, primarily by anthropologists but also occasionally by sociologists. [[Cultural studies]], (European) [[ethnology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[social work]], [[education]], [[design]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[folkloristics]], [[religious studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[communication studies]], [[performance studies]], [[advertising]], nursing, [[urban planning]], [[usability]], [[political science]],&lt;ref&gt;Schatz, Edward, ed. ''Political Ethnography: What Immersion Contributes to the Study of Power''. University Of Chicago Press. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[social movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Balsiger, P., Lambelet, A.,  Participant Observation. In D. Della Porta (Ed.), Methodological Practices in Social Movement Research (pp. 144-172). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[criminology]] are other fields which have made use of ethnography.

===Cultural and social anthropology===
[[Cultural anthropology]] and [[social anthropology]] were developed around ethnographic research and their [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] texts, which are mostly ethnographies: e.g. ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], ''Ethnologische Excursion in Johore'' (1875) by [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]],  ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928) by [[Margaret Mead]], ''The Nuer'' (1940) by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], ''Naven'' (1936, 1958) by [[Gregory Bateson]], or "[[The Lele of the Kasai]]" (1963) by [[Mary Douglas]]. Cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research. The typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people, almost always based at least in part on [[emic]] views of where the culture begins and ends. Using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common.&lt;ref&gt;Naroll, Raoul. ''Handbook of Methods in Cultural Anthropology.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographies are also sometimes called "case studies."&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Leo. ''Shadowed Lives: Undocumented Workers in American Society'' (Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology). 1997, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnographers study and interpret culture, its universalities, and its variations through the ethnographic study based on [[fieldwork]]. An ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture, society, or community. The fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society, living with the local people and learning about their ways of life.  Neophyte Ethnographers are strongly encouraged to develop extensive familiarity with their subject prior to entering the field; otherwise, they may find themselves in difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=Janet M.C. | title=Caught in the Riptide: Female Researcher in a Patricentric Setting.  Pp. 171-182 in Fragile Truths: 25 Years of Sociology and Anthropology in Canada.  D. Harrison, W.K. Carroll, L. Christiansen-Ruffman and Raymond Currie (eds.) | publisher=Carleton University Press | year=1992 | location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnographers are participant observers. They take part in events they study because it helps with understanding local behavior and thought. Classic examples are [[Carol B. Stack]]'s ''All Our Kin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stack |first=Carol B. | title=All Our Kin:Strategies for Survival in a black community | publisher=Harper and Row | year=1974 | location=New York, New York | isbn=0-06-013974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Briggs' ''Never in Anger'', [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard Lee]]'s ''Kalahari Hunter-Gatherers'', [[Victor Turner]]'s ''Forest of Symbols'', David Maybry-Lewis' ''Akew-Shavante Society'', [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s ''The Nuer,'' and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]''. Iterations of ethnographic representations in the classic, modernist camp include Joseph W. Bastien's "Drum and Stethoscope" (1992), Bartholomew Dean's recent (2009) contribution, ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=University Press of Florida: Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |publisher=Upf.com |date=2009-11-15 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical ethnography attempts to be [[holistic]]&lt;ref name="Ember 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heider, Karl 2001"/&gt; and typically follows an outline to include a brief history of the culture in question, an analysis of the [[physical geography]] or terrain inhabited by the people under study, including [[climate]], and often including what biological anthropologists call [[habitat]]. Folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences. Material culture, technology, and means of subsistence are usually treated next, as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure.  Kinship and social structure (including age grading, peer groups, gender, voluntary associations, clans, moieties, and so forth, if they exist) are typically included. Languages spoken, dialects, and the history of language change are another group of standard topics.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ember and Ember 2006, Heider 2001 op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Practices of childrearing, acculturation, and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ember and Ember 2006, op cit., Chapters 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rites, rituals, and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies, especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them.&lt;ref&gt;Truner, Victor. ''The Forest of Symbols''.  remainder of citation forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

As ethnography developed, anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture, such as values, worldview and what [[Clifford Geertz]] termed the "ethos" of the culture. In his fieldwork, Geertz used elements of a [[Empirical research|phenomenological]] approach, tracing not just the doings of people, but the cultural elements themselves. For example, if within a group of people, winking was a communicative gesture, he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean (it might mean several things). Then, he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used, and whether, as one moved about a region, winks remained meaningful in the same way. In this way, cultural boundaries of communication could be explored, as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence. Geertz, while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline, moved outside that outline to talk about "webs" instead of "outlines"&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. ''The Interpretation of Culture,'' Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; of culture.

Within cultural anthropology, there are several subgenres of ethnography.  Beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s, anthropologists began writing "bio-confessional" ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research.  Famous examples include ''[[Tristes Tropiques]]'' (1955) by Lévi-Strauss, ''The High Valley'' by Kenneth Read, and ''The Savage and the Innocent'' by [[David Maybury-Lewis]], as well as the mildly fictionalized ''Return to Laughter'' by Elenore Smith Bowen ([[Laura Bohannan]]).

Later "[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]]" ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer.  Famous examples include ''Deep Play:  Notes on a Balinese Cockfight'' by [[Clifford Geertz]],  ''Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco'' by [[Paul Rabinow]], ''The Headman and I'' by Jean-Paul Dumont, and ''Tuhami'' by Vincent Crapanzano.  In the 1980s, the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline, under the general influence of [[literary theory]] and [[postcolonial|post-colonial]]/[[post-structuralist]] thought.  "Experimental" ethnographies that reveal the ferment of the discipline include ''Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man'' by [[Michael Taussig]], ''Debating Muslims'' by Michael F. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, ''A Space on the Side of the Road'' by Kathleen Stewart, and ''Advocacy after Bhopal'' by Kim Fortun.

This critical turn in sociocultural anthropology during the mid-1980s can be traced to the influence of the now classic (and often contested) text, ''Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography'', (1986) edited by [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] and [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]]. ''Writing Culture'' helped bring changes to both anthropology and ethnography often described in terms of being 'postmodern,' 'reflexive,' 'literary,' 'deconstructive,' or 'poststructural' in nature, in that the text helped to highlight the various epistemic and political predicaments that many practitioners saw as plaguing ethnographic representations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll. ''Beyond Writing Culture: Current Intersections of Epistemologies and Representational Practices.'' (2010). New York: Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|978-1-84545-675-7}}. Pgs. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Where Geertz's and [[Victor Turner|Turner's]] interpretive anthropology recognized subjects as creative actors who constructed their sociocultural worlds out of symbols, postmodernists attempted to draw attention to the privileged status of the ethnographers themselves. That is, the ethnographer cannot escape the personal viewpoint in creating an ethnographic account, thus making any claims of objective neutrality highly problematic, if not altogether impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Erickson &amp; Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory,'' Third Edition. (2008). Toronto: Broadview Press. {{ISBN|978-1-55111-871-0}}. Pg. 190&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this last point, ''Writing Culture'' became a focal point for looking at how ethnographers could describe different cultures and societies without denying the subjectivity of those individuals and groups being studied while simultaneously doing so without laying claim to absolute knowledge and objective authority.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson &amp; Murphy (2008). A History of Anthropological Theory, Pgs. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology,' 'narrative ethnography,'&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Ghodsee, "Writing Ethnographies that Ordinary People Can Read." {{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227060610/http://www.anthropology-news.org/index.php/2013/05/24/writing-ethnographies-that-ordinary-people-can-read/ |archivedate=2013-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'literary ethnography',&lt;ref&gt;Literary Ethnography http://literary-ethnography.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Writing Culture'' helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography.'&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"&gt;Olaf Zenker &amp; Karsten Kumoll.

Pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration of the relationship between writer, audience, and subject has become a central tenet of contemporary anthropological and ethnographic practice. In certain instances, active collaboration between the researcher(s) and subject(s) has helped blend the practice of collaboration in ethnographic fieldwork with the process of creating the ethnographic product resulting from the research.&lt;ref name="ZenkerKumoll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter (2001). "From 'Reading over the Shoulders of Natives' to 'Reading alongside Natives', Literally: Toward a Collaborative and Reciprocal Ethnography", in ''Journal of Anthropologcal Research,'' 57(2):137-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke E. Lassiter. "Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology". (2005). ''Current Anthropology,'' 46(1):83-106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Sociology}}
[[Sociology]] is another field which prominently features ethnographies. [[Urban sociology]], Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School,]] in particular, are associated with ethnographic research, with some well-known early examples being ''[[The Philadelphia Negro]]'' (1899) by W. E. B. Du Bois, ''[[Street Corner Society]]'' by [[William Foote Whyte]] and ''[[Black Metropolis]]'' by [[St. Clair Drake]] and [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]]. Major influences on this development were anthropologist [[Lloyd Warner]], on the Chicago sociology faculty, and to [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]]'s experience as a journalist. [[Symbolic interactionism]] developed from the same tradition and yielded such sociological ethnographies as ''Shared Fantasy'' by [[Gary Alan Fine]], which documents the early history of fantasy [[role-playing games]].  Other important ethnographies in sociology include [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s work on Algeria and France.

Jaber F. Gubrium's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness, care, and recovery are notable.  They include ''Living and Dying at Murray Manor,'' which describes the social worlds of a nursing home; ''Describing Care: Image and Practice in Rehabilitation,'' which documents the social organization of patient subjectivity in a physical rehabilitation hospital; ''Caretakers: Treating Emotionally Disturbed Children,'' which features the social construction of behavioral disorders in children; and ''Oldtimers and Alzheimer's: The Descriptive Organization of Senility,'' which describes how the Alzheimer's disease movement constructed a new subjectivity of senile dementia and how that is organized in a geriatric hospital. Another approach to ethnography in sociology comes in the form of [[institutional ethnography]], developed by [[Dorothy E. Smith]] for studying the social relations which structure people's everyday lives.

Other notable ethnographies include [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]]'s ''Learning to Labour,'' on working class youth; the work of [[Elijah Anderson]], [[Mitchell Duneier]], and [[Loïc Wacquant]] on black America, and Lai Olurode's ''Glimpses of Madrasa From Africa''.  But even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods, ethnography is not the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the discipline, as it is in cultural anthropology.

=== Communication Studies ===
Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, ethnographic research methods began to be widely used by communication scholars. As the purpose of ethnography is to describe and interpret the shared and learned patterns of values, behaviors, beliefs, and language of a culture-sharing group, Harris, (1968), also Agar (1980) note that ethnography is both a process and an outcome of the research. Studies such as [[Gerry Philipsen|Gerry Philipsen's]] analysis of cultural communication strategies in a [[blue-collar]], working-class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, ''Speaking 'Like a Man' in Teamsterville'', paved the way for the expansion of ethnographic research in the study of communication.

Scholars of [[communication studies]] use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena. This is often characterized in the writing as attempts to understand taken-for-granted routines by which working definitions are socially produced. Ethnography as a method is a storied, careful, and systematic examination of the reality-generating mechanisms of everyday life (Coulon, 1995). Ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain "how" ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities. This often gives the perception of trying to answer the "why" and "how come" questions of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R. B., Rubin, A. M., and Piele, L. J. (2005). ''Communication Research: Strategies and Sources.'' Belmont, California: Thomson Wadworth. pp. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often this type of research results in a [[case study]] or [[field study]] such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally, or the way firemen communicate during "down time" at a fire station.  Like anthropology scholars, communication scholars often immerse themselves, and participate in and/or directly observe the particular [[social group]] being studied.&lt;ref&gt;Bentz, V. M., and Shapiro, J. J. (1998). ''Mindful Inquiry in Social Research.'' Thousand Oaks, California: Sage. pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
The American anthropologist [[George Spindler]] was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology to the classroom.

Anthropologists such as [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Mary Douglas]] have used ethnographic data to answer academic questions about consumers and consumption.  In this sense, Tony Salvador, [[Genevieve Bell]], and Ken Anderson describe design ethnography as being "a way of understanding the particulars of daily life in such a way as to increase the success probability of a new product or service or, more appropriately, to reduce the probability of failure specifically due to a lack of understanding of the basic behaviors and frameworks of consumers."&lt;ref&gt;Salvador, Tony; Genevieve Bell; and Ken Anderson (1999) "Design Ethnography," ''Design Management Journal'' (pp. 35-41). p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Sam Ladner argues in her book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Ethnography-Guide-Private-Sector/dp/1611323908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396459593&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sam+ladner] ''Practical Ethnography''&lt;/ref&gt; that understanding consumers and their desires requires a shift in "standpoint," one that only ethnography provides. The results are products and services that respond to consumers' unmet needs.

Businesses, too, have found ethnographers helpful for understanding how people use products and services. Companies make increasing use of ethnographic methods to understand consumers and consumption, or for new product development (such as [[video ethnography]]). The ''Ethnographic Praxis in Industry'' (EPIC) conference is evidence of this. Ethnographers' systematic and holistic approach to real-life experience is valued by product developers, who use the method to understand unstated desires or cultural practices that surround products. Where focus groups fail to inform marketers about what people really do, ethnography links what people say to what they do—avoiding the pitfalls that come from relying only on self-reported, focus-group data. Modern developments in computing power and AI have enabled higher efficiencies in ethnographic data collection via multimedia and computational analysis using machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon A, Liu Y, Setchi R. [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2592105 Computer-Aided Ethnography in Engineering Design]. ASME. International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Volume 7: 28th International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology ():V007T06A007. doi:10.1115/DETC2016-59832.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating ethnography ==
The Ethnographic methodology is not usually evaluated in terms of philosophical standpoint (such as [[positivism]] and [[Appearance emotionalism|emotionalism]]). Ethnographic studies need to be evaluated in some manner.  No consensus has been developed on evaluation standards, but Richardson (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;254)&lt;ref&gt;Richardson,L. (2000). "Evaluating ethnography," in ''Qualitative Inquiry,'' 6(2), 253-255&lt;/ref&gt;  provides five criteria that ethnographers might find helpful. Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein's (1997) monograph, ''The New Language of Qualitative Method,'' discusses forms of ethnography in terms of their "methods talk."

# ''Substantive contribution'': "Does the piece contribute to our understanding of social life?"
# ''Aesthetic merit'': "Does this piece succeed aesthetically?"
# ''Reflexivity'': "How did the author come to write this text…Is there adequate self-awareness and self-exposure for the reader to make judgments about the point of view?"&lt;ref&gt;For post-colonial critiques of ethnography from various locations, see essays in Prem Poddar et al, ''Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Impact'': "Does this affect me? Emotionally? Intellectually?"  Does it move me?
# ''Expresses a reality'': "Does it seem 'true'—a credible account of a cultural, social, individual, or communal sense of the 'real'?"

==Challenges of ethnography==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Ethnography, which is a method dedicated entirely to field work, is aimed at gaining a deeper insight of a certain people's knowledge and social culture.

Ethnography's advantages are:
* It can open up certain experiences during group research that other research methods fail to cover.
* Notions that are taken for granted can be highlighted and confronted.
* It can tap into intuitive and deep human understanding of and interpretations of (by the ethnographer) the accounts of informants (those who are being studied), which goes far beyond what quantitative research can do in terms of extracting meanings.
* Ethnography allows people outside of a culture (whether of a primitive tribe or of a corporation's employees) to learn about its members' practices, motives, understandings, and values.

However, there are certain challenges or limitations for the ethnographic method: 
* Deep expertise is required: Ethnographers must accumulate knowledge about the methods and domains of interest, which can take considerable training and time.
* Sensitivity: The ethnographer is an outsider and must exercise discretion and caution to avoid offending, alienating or harming those being observed.
* Access: Negotiating access to field sites and participants can be time-consuming and difficult. Secretive or guarded organizations may require different approaches in order for researchers to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Monahan |first=Torin, Fisher, Jill A. | year = 2014 | title = Strategies for Obtaining Access to Secretive or Guarded Organizations | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | doi=10.1177/0891241614549834|pmc=4679148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Duration and cost: Research can involve prolonged time in the field, particularly because building trust with participants is usually necessary for obtaining rich data.
* Bias: Ethnographers bring their own experience to bear in pursuing questions to ask and reviewing data, which can lead to biases in directions of inquiry and analysis.
* Descriptive approach:  Ethnography relies heavily on storytelling and the presentation of critical incidents, which is inevitably selective and viewed as a weakness by those used to the scientific approaches of hypothesis testing, quantification and replication.

Among the dangers of ethnography are that it can become indistinguishable from a kind of [[embedded journalism]] or [[blog]] with academic jargon giving it the veneer of academic legitimacy but without actually meeting the classic requirements for ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, B. (2013).  "Post-Cold War Anthropology as  Ideological Blog:  Purging Klukhohn and Mead for a Diary Read",  ''Journal of Developing Societies'', Spring, Volume 29, No. 1, 61-87.  &lt;/ref&gt;  A series of tests can be applied to determine whether work is actually ethnography or academic journalism depending on the focus of the study (an "ethnos"), the scientific hypotheses and questions, whether there is model building, whether there are cross-cultural comparisons, and the purpose, uses and forms of the work.

==Ethics==
[[Gary Alan Fine]] argues that the nature of ethnographic inquiry demands that researchers deviate from formal and idealistic rules or ethics that have come to be widely accepted in qualitative and quantitative approaches in research. Many of these ethical assumptions are rooted in positivist and post-positivist [[epistemology|epistemologies]] that have adapted over time but are apparent and must be accounted for in all research paradigms. These ethical dilemmas are evident throughout the entire process of conducting ethnographies, including the design, implementation, and reporting of an ethnographic study. Essentially, Fine maintains that researchers are typically not as ethical as they claim or assume to be — and that "each job includes ways of doing things that would be inappropriate for others to know".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine is not necessarily casting blame at ethnographic researchers but tries to show that researchers often make idealized ethical claims and standards which in are inherently based on partial truths and self-deceptions. Fine also acknowledges that many of these partial truths and self-deceptions are unavoidable. He maintains that "illusions" are essential to maintain an occupational reputation and avoid potentially more caustic consequences. He claims, "Ethnographers cannot help but lie, but in lying, we reveal truths that escape those who are not so bold".&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these assertions, Fine establishes three conceptual clusters in which ethnographic ethical dilemmas can be situated: "Classic Virtues", "Technical Skills", and "Ethnographic Self".

Much debate surrounding the issue of ethics arose following revelations about how the ethnographer [[Napoleon Chagnon]] conducted his ethnographic fieldwork with the [[Yanomani]] people of South America.

While there is no international standard on Ethnographic Ethics, many western anthropologists look to the American Anthropological Association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work.&lt;ref&gt;''American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics'' http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/AAA-Ethics-Code-2009.pdf, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Association adopted a code of ethics, stating: Anthropologists have "moral obligations as members of other groups, such as the family, religion, and community, as well as the profession".&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The code of ethics notes that anthropologists are part of a wider scholarly and political network, as well as human and natural environment, which needs to be reported on respectfully.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The code of ethics recognizes that sometimes very close and personal relationship can sometimes develop from doing ethnographic work.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.1"/&gt; The Association acknowledges that the code is limited in scope; ethnographic work can sometimes be multidisciplinary, and anthropologists need to be familiar with ethics and perspectives of other disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The eight-page code of ethics outlines ethical considerations for those conducting Research, Teaching, Application and Dissemination of Results, which are briefly outlined below.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Conducting Research" - When conducting research Anthropologists need to be aware of the potential impacts of the research on the people and animals they study.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  If the seeking of new knowledge will negatively impact the people and animals they will be studying they may not undertake the study according to the code of ethics.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.2-3"/&gt;
* "Teaching" - When teaching the discipline of anthropology, instructors are required to inform students of the ethical dilemmas of conducting ethnographies and field work.&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Application" - When conducting an ethnography, Anthropologists must be "open with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and relevant parties affected by the work about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for the work."&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Dissemination of Results" - When disseminating results of an ethnography, "[a]nthropologists have an ethical obligation to consider the potential impact of both their research and the communication or dissemination of the results of their research on all directly or indirectly involved."&lt;ref&gt;American Anthropology Association Code of Ethics, p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people.&lt;ref name="Ethics p.5"/&gt;

===Classic virtues===
* "The kindly ethnographer" – Most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are, which aids in the research process, but is also deceptive. The identity that we present to subjects is different from who we are in other circumstances.
* "The friendly ethnographer" – Ethnographers operate under the assumption that they should not dislike anyone. When ethnographers find they intensely dislike individuals encountered in the research, they may crop them out of the findings.&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;Fine, p. 270-77&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The honest ethnographer" – If research participants know the research goals, their responses will likely be skewed. Therefore, ethnographers often conceal what they know in order to increase the likelihood of acceptance by participants.&lt;ref name="Fine" /&gt;

===Technical skills===
* "The Precise Ethnographer" – Ethnographers often create the illusion that field notes are data and reflect what "really" happened. They engage in the opposite of plagiarism, giving undeserved credit through loose interpretations and paraphrasing. Researchers take near-fictions and turn them into claims of fact. The closest ethnographers can ever really get to reality is an approximate truth.
* "The Observant Ethnographer" – Readers of ethnography are often led to assume the report of a scene is complete – that little of importance was missed. In reality, an ethnographer will always miss some aspect because of lacking omniscience. Everything is open to multiple interpretations and misunderstandings. As ethnographers' skills in observation and collection of data vary by individual, what is depicted in ethnography can never be the whole picture.
* "The Unobtrusive Ethnographer" – As a "participant" in the scene, the researcher will always have an effect on the communication that occurs within the research site. The degree to which one is an "active member" affects the extent to which sympathetic understanding is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, p. 277-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic Self===
The following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers:

* "The Candid Ethnographer" – Where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic. There is an illusion that everything reported was observed by the researcher.
* "The Chaste Ethnographer" – When ethnographers participate within the field, they invariably develop relationships with research subjects/participants. These relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography, although they may influence the research findings.
* "The Fair Ethnographer" – Fine claims that objectivity is an illusion and that everything in ethnography is known from a perspective. Therefore, it is unethical for a researcher to report fairness in findings.
* "The Literary Ethnographer" – Representation is a balancing act of determining what to "show" through poetic/prosaic language and style, versus what to "tell" via straightforward, 'factual' reporting. The individual skills of an ethnographer influence what appears to be the value of the research.&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 282-89"&gt;Fine, p. 282-89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Norman K. Denzin, ethnographers should consider the following eight principles when observing, recording, and sampling data:

# The groups should combine symbolic meanings with patterns of interaction.
# Observe the world from the point of view of the subject, while maintaining the distinction between everyday and scientific perceptions of reality.
# Link the group's symbols and their meanings with the social relationships.
# Record all behavior.
# The methodology should highlight phases of process, change, and stability.
# The act should be a type of symbolic interactionism.
# Use concepts that would avoid casual explanations.

The '''European Institute of Oncology''' ({{lang-it|Istituto Europeo di Oncologia}}, '''IEO''') is a non-profit private-law comprehensive [[cancer]] centre located in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  It is a clinic, a research centre and a training institution.

The European Institute of [[Oncology]] works on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer by developing clinical and scientific research coupled with organisation and management.

==History==
 
The European Institute of Oncology was conceived by [[Umberto Veronesi]], who developed a new model for health and advanced research in the international oncology field.  The institute was inaugurated in May 1994, and is managed by Division and Unit Directors from eight European countries.

The Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or “Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico”) through the [[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decree]] issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology provides services through agreements with Italy’s National Health Service. Professor Gordon McVie performs outreach activities on behalf of the IEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=WG|title=International health experts attend research and development conference hosted by Yeovil District Hospital|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/International-health-experts-attend-research/story-20959561-detail/story.html|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Institute integrates various activities involved in the fight against cancer: prevention and diagnosis, health education and training, research and treatment.

At its centre in Via Ripamonti  all clinical, research and training activities take place.  In 2002 the institute opened IEO CENTRO, an integrated cancer diagnosis centre located in Milan downtown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">The interplay of '''exercise and music''' have been long-discussed, crossing the disciplines of [[biomechanics]], [[neurology]], [[physiology]], and [[sport psychology]]. People "automatically feel the beat" of the music they listen to and instinctively adjust their walking pace and heart rate to the tempo of the music&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franěk|first=Marek|last2=van Noorden|first2=Leon|last3=Režný|first3=Lukáš|date=2014-12-02|title=Tempo and walking speed with music in the urban context|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251309/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01361|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4251309|pmid=25520682}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Listening to music while exercising has been found in multiple studies to create an increased sense of motivation, distracting the mind while increasing heart rate. Faster tempo music has been found by researchers to motivate exercisers to work harder when performing at a moderate pace, but peak performance has been found to be unaffected by listening to music.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;Reynolds, Gretchen. [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/phys-ed-does-music-make-you-exercise-harder "Phys Ed: Does Music Make You Exercise Harder?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 25, 2010. Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study published in 2009, researchers at the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences at [[Liverpool John Moores University]] had 12 subjects ride a stationary bicycle at a pace that they could sustain for 30 minutes while listening to a song of the subject's choice. In successive trials, they rode the bikes again, with the tempo of the music variously increased or decreased by 10%, without the subject's knowledge. The researchers results showed that the riders heart rate and mileage decreased when the tempo was slowed, while they rode a greater distance, increased their heart rate and enjoyed the music more at the faster tempo. Though the participants thought their workout was harder at the more upbeat tempo, the researchers found that when the faster-paced music was heard while exercising "the participants chose to accept, and even prefer, a greater degree of effort".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse J, Hudson P, Edwards B. "Effects of music tempo upon submaximal cycling performance.", Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Aug;20(4):662-9.{{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.00948.x}} {{PMID|19793214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]] found in a 2003 study that participants who chose to listen to faster-paced music generated a higher heart rate, pedaled harder and generated more power, increasing their level of work by as much as 15% by diverting their focus to the music. The study tested 20 volunteers who listened to an MP3 player loaded with a mix of 13 songs that they selected and then rode an exercise bike for an hour at a pace and gear of their choice. The study found that heart rates rose from 133 to 146 beats per minute and power output increased accordingly, when listening to the tempo-less sound of crashing waves versus music with a medium to fast tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Fauber, John via ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9AQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fggGAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=exercise%20music%20tempo%20physiology&amp;pg=6984%2C2509395 "Workout with a tempo: Choice of music can affect exercise intensity"], ''[[The Free Lance–Star]]'', November 9, 2003.

Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study by a research team from Australia, Israel and the United States found that runners performing at a pace where they were at 90% of their peak oxygen uptake enjoyed listening to music. Crazy enough, the music had no effect on their heart rate or running pace, regardless of the music's tempo.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tenenbaum, G.; Lidor, R.; Lavyan, N.; Morrow, K.; Tonnel, S.; Gershgoren, A.; Meis, J.; and Johnson, M. "The effect of music type on running perseverance and coping with effort sensations", ''Psychology of Sport and Exercise'' Volume 5, Issue 2, April 2004, Pages 89-109. {{doi|10.1016/S1469-0292(02)00041-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, studies suggest that athletes use music in purposeful ways to facilitate training and performance. In one study, seventy elite Swedish athletes completed a questionnaire relating the empirical motives for listening to music. The results showed that most of they often listened to music during pre-event, pre-training sessions, and warm-ups.

To further this idea, a study from the ''New York Times'' shows how music helps boost workouts. This experiment was done by testing a control group of people working out in a normal workout setting and the same group of people working out with machines that incorporated beats and rhythms into each rep. To do this, they installed the kits into three different workout machines, one a stair-stepper, the other two weight machines with bars that could be raised or pulled down to stimulate various muscles. Thomas Hans Fritz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute who led the study said, “Participants could express themselves on the machines by, for instance, modulating rhythms and creating melodies.” Throughout each workout, the researchers monitored the force their volunteers generated while using the machines, as well as whether the weight lifters’ movements tended to stutter or flow and how much oxygen the volunteers consumed, a reliable measure of physical effort. Afterward, the scientists asked the volunteers to rate the tolerability or unpleasantness of the session, on a scale from 1 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/how-music-can-boost-our-workouts/?_r=1 |title=How Music Can Boost Our Workouts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">In [[artificial intelligence]] and in heuristic [[decision-making]], a '''fast-and-frugal tree''' is a type of [[classification tree]]. Fast-and-frugal trees can be used as  decision-making tools which operate as lexicographic classifiers, and, if required, associate an action (decision) to each class or category.&lt;ref name=naive&gt;Martignon, Laura; Vitouch, Oliver; Takezawa, Masanori; Forster, Malcolm. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27278577_Naive_and_Yet_Enlightened_From_Natural_Frequencies_to_Fast_and_Frugal_Decision_Trees "Naive and Yet Enlightened: From Natural Frequencies to Fast and Frugal Decision Trees"], published in ''Thinking : Psychological perspectives on reasoning, judgement and decision making'' (David Hardman and Laura Macchi; editors), Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The original fast-and-frugal trees introduced in 2003 by [[Laura Martignon]], et al. are simple both in execution and in construction, and constitute a kind of simple [[heuristic]] in the adaptive toolbox postulated by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition.&lt;ref name=naive /&gt; Similar models had been previously used by Martignon &amp; Hoffrage, 1999; Green and Mehr, 1997  {{ran|GM}}; Dhami and Ayton, 2001 {{ran|DA}}; Dhami and Harries, 2001 {{ran|DH}} and Fischer, Steiner, Zucol, Berger, Martignon, et al. 2002 {{ran|FZBM}}. 

Yet recent developments in several fields of application have maintained the simplicity in execution, introducing subtle, relevant  procedures for construction that have proven extremely useful for users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381858 ''Luan, Sheng Hua, Schooler, Lael &amp; Gigerenzer Gerd Psychol Rev.''] 2011 Apr;118(2):316-38. doi: 10.1037/a0022684. A signal-detection analysis of fast-and-frugal trees. Luan, S.; Schooler, LJ; Gigerenzer, G.&lt;/ref&gt;

== How a fast-and-frugal tree works ==
The basic elements on which to ground a binary classification are (sets of) cues.  The fast-and-frugal tree establishes a ranking and, according to the ranking, a “topology” of the tree. Once the ranking is established, the fast-and-frugal tree checks one cue at a time, and at each step, one of the possible outcomes of the considered cue is an exit node which allows for a decision.

Fast-and-frugal trees can also be described in terms of their building blocks. First, they have a search rule: They inspect cues in a specific order. Second, they have a stopping rule: Each cue has one value that leads to an exit node and hence to a classification, and another value that leads to consulting the next cue in the cue hierarchy (the exception being the last cue in the hierarchy, which has two exit nodes). Finally, they have a classification rule.  

[[File:Fast-and-Frugal-Tree.jpg|alt=Example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree|thumb|410x410px|Figure 1: An example of Fast-and-Frugal Tree]]
Figure 1 illustrates a fast-and-frugal tree for classifying a patient as “high risk” of having a heart stroke and thus having to be sent to the “coronary care unit” or “low risk” and thus having to be sent to a “regular nursing bed {{ran|GM}} (Green&amp; Mehr, 1997). 
Fast-and-frugal trees have been characterized mathematically as lexicographic classifiers (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) and as linear classifiers with non-compensatory weights (Martignon, Katsikopoulos and Woike, 2008) {{ran|MKW}}. Their “topology” and construction has been analysed using signal detection theory (Luan, Schooler and Gigerenzer, 2011) {{ran|LSG}} and their performance and robustness when compared to regression and CARts has been studied by Laskey and Martignon (2014){{ran|LM}}. An extensive study on the robustness, the predictive value and sensitivity/specificity of Fast-And-Frugal trees compared to those of [[Naive Bayes]] and of Full Natural Frequency Trees has been carried out by{{ran|WHM}}.

In 2017, Phillips, Neth, Woike and Gaissmaier {{ran|PNWG}} introduced the R package [https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FFTrees FFTrees], which uses new algorithms to construct and evaluate FFTs. A simulation study across ten real-world data sets shows that FFTs created by FFTrees can predict data as well as more complex classification algorithms, while remaining simple enough for anyone to understand and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10277">In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''flying primate hypothesis''' posits that [[megabat]]s, a subgroup of [[Chiroptera]] (also known as [[Pteropus|flying fox]]es), form an evolutionary [[sister group]] of [[primate]]s. The [[hypothesis]] began with [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758, and was again advanced by J.D. Smith in 1980.&lt;ref name="pmid18367343"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Maseko BC, Manger PR |title=Primate-like retinotectal decussation in an echolocating megabat, ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal=Neuroscience |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=226–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18367343 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.019 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Smith JD (1980) Chiropteran phylogenetics: introduction.

This was followed up by a longer study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Jamieson BG, Robson SK, Hall LS, McAnally KI, Cooper HM |year=1989 |title=Phylogenetic relations between microbats, megabats and primates (Mammalia: Chiroptera and Primates) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=325 |pages=489–559 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1989.0102|issue=1229}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which this was supported by the analysis of many other [[brain]] and body characteristics. Pettigrew suggested that flying foxes, [[colugo]]s, and primates were all descendants of the same group of early [[arboreal]] mammals. The megabat flight and the colugo [[Gliding flight|gliding]] could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground.

The flying primate hypothesis met resistance from many zoologists. Its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related, which reflects earlier ideas (such as the grouping of primates, [[tree shrew]]s, colugos, and [[bat]]s under the same [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] group, the [[Superorder]] [[Archonta]]). Rather, many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and [[microbat]]s (or [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocating]] bats) formed distinct branches of mammalian [[evolution]], with flight having [[convergent evolution|evolved twice]]. This implication was borne out of the fact that microbats do not resemble primates in any of the neural characteristics studied by Pettigrew, instead resembling primitive mammals such as [[Insectivora]] in these respects. The advanced brain characters demonstrated in ''Pteropus'' could not, therefore, be generalized to imply that all bats are similar to primates.

More recently, the flying primate hypothesis was rejected when scientists compared the DNA of bats to that of primates. These genetic studies support the [[monophyly]] of bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 |date=May 2001 |author1=Springer, Ms |author2=Teeling, Ec |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Stanhope, Mj |author5=De, Jong, Ww | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation | volume=98 | issue=11 | pages=6241–6 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11353869 | format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation | doi=10.1038/nature06549 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html | accessdate=2008-07-03 | date=2008-02-14 | work=Nature | volume=451 | issue=7180 | pages=818–821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1105113 |date=January 2005 |author1=Teeling, Ec |author2=Springer, Ms |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Bates, P |author5=O'Brien, Sj |author6=Murphy, Wj | title=A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record | volume=307 | issue=5709 | pages=580–4 | pmid=15681385 | journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |author1=Eick, Gn |author2=Jacobs, Ds |author3=Matthee, Ca | title=A nuclear DNA phylogenetic perspective on the evolution of echolocation and historical biogeography of extant bats (chiroptera) | volume=22 | issue=9 | pages=1869–86 | pmid=15930153 | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15930153 | format=Free full text | doi=10.1093/molbev/msi180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological studies==
Soon after Pettigrew's study, work on another genus of megabat (''[[Rousettus]]'') disputed the existence of an advanced pattern of connections between the [[retina]] and the [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiele A, Vogelsang M, Hoffmann KP |year=1991 |title=Pattern of retinotectal projection in the megachiropteran bat ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal= Journal of Comparative Neurology |doi=10.1002/cne.903140404 |volume=314 |pages=671–683 | pmid=1816270 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion was later criticised on methodological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosa MG, Schmid LM |year=1994 |title=Topography and extent of visual-field representation in the superior colliculus of the megachiropteran Pteropus |journal=Visual Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1037–1057 | doi=10.1017/S0952523800006878 | pmid=7841115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have sought further evidence of unique characteristics linking the megabat and primate brains. These studies have had limited success in identifying unique links between megabats and present-day primates, instead concluding that the megabat brain has characteristics that may resemble those likely to have existed in primitive primate brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ichida JM, Rosa MG, Casagrande VA |year=2000 |title=Does the visual system of the flying fox resemble that of primates?

==Biochemical studies==
The implication that bats are [[diphyletic]] has been fiercely disputed by many zoologists, not only based on the unlikelihood that [[wing]]s would have evolved twice in mammals, but also on biochemical studies of molecular evolution, which indicate that bats are [[monophyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mindell DP, Dick CW, Baker RJ |year=1991 |title=Phylogenetic relationships among megabats, microbats, and primates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=88 |issue=22 |pages=10322–10326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.22.10322 | pmid = 1658803 | pmc = 52920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stanhope MJ, Czelusniak J, Si JS, Nickerson J, Goodman M |year=1992 | title=A molecular perspective on mammalian evolution from the gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, with convincing evidence for bat monophyly |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–60| doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90026-D | pmid=1342928}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have disputed the validity of these conclusions. In particular, it has been argued that [[phylogenies]] based solely on DNA data can be subject to an artifact named the "base-compositional bias" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutcheon JM, Kirsch JA, Pettigrew JD | year=1998 |title=Base-compositional biases and the bat problem.

A '''footprint''' or '''land pattern''' is the arrangement of [[Contact pad|pads]] (in [[surface-mount technology]]) or through-holes (in [[through-hole technology]]) used to physically attach and electrically connect a component to a [[printed circuit board]].&lt;ref name="ipc7351"&gt;{{cite book | title=IPC-7351 - Generic Requirements for Surface Mount Design and Land Pattern Standard | publisher=IPC | year=2005 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land pattern on a circuit board matches the arrangement of [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] on a component.

Component manufacturers often produce multiple [[Pin compatibility|pin-compatible]] product variants to allow [[Systems integrator|systems integrators]] to change the exact component in use without changing the footprint on the circuit board. This can provide large cost savings for integrators, especially with dense [[Ball Grid Array|BGA]] components where the footprint pads may be connected to multiple [[Printed circuit board#Lamination|layers]] of the circuit board.

== Summary ==
''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'' has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.

=== Part I. The Problem: We Need to Make Decisions, But We Don't Know How (Chapters 1–6) ===

For ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary.  The book cites [[The Dice Man]] – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.

Chapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?).  Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. [[Kant]]), in our character (e.g. [[Aristotle]], [[virtue ethics]]) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. [[Utilitarianism]]).

Chapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.

Chapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism.  These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules.&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"&gt;[https://iainbking.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/how-to-make-good-decisions-62-point-summary.pdf ''How to Make Good Decisions...'' a 62 point summary (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.&lt;ref&gt;http://leehopkins.com/counselling/2015/11/12/ethics-condundrum-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II. The Proof: Finding the Basics of Right and Wrong (Chapters 7–14) ===

Part II starts with a secular revision of [[Pascal’s Wager]],&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

It says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” &lt;ref&gt;[http://petergreenwell.com/essays/did-angela-do-good-or-bad/ ''Did Angela do Good or Bad?'' Peter Greenwell, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

It then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed.  These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of [[John Rawls|John Rawls']] theory;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; an argument from evolutionary theory;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophynow.org/issues/100/Moral_Laws_of_the_Jungle ''Moral Laws of the Jungle'', Philosophy Now magazine, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a '[[Sherlock Holmes]]' approach.

All four arguments converge on [[empathy]], [[duty|obligation]] and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; According to [[Audrey Tang]], King's philosophy advocates: "If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang ''Open Source Enlightenment'', Audrey Tang, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part III. The Principle: Refining the Help Principle (Chapters 15–22) ===

Part III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on [[autonomy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijbioethics.ir/fa/ManuscriptDetail?mid=5331 International Journal of Bio-Ethics, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a critique of the [[Golden Rule#Cannot be a sole guide to action|golden rule]].

It results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics.  This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, J. F. and Adams, C. K. (2016). "On Measuring the Moral Value of Action". ''Frontiers of Philosophy in China''. 11(1), pp. 122–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part IV. The Program: Extending the Principles to Other Problems (Chapters 23–31) ===

Part IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schokking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gendels-ross-research-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Contradicting [[Aristotle]], who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and [[St Augustine]], who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/02/05/imp06.asp Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka), February 5th, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiomedia.com/15store/4259  ''The Conundrum of Illicit Financial Flows'', Teshome Abebe, November 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests.  Both individual justice and social justice feature.

=== Part V. Practical Advice: For Real People in the Modern World (Chapters 32–38) ===

Part V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy.  These problems make [[effective altruism]] impractical and rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ispitphilo.wordpress.com/ ''Food for the Mind'', by Blake Hall, May 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 34 argues that the notion of [[integrity]] can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.

=== Part VI. The Prognosis: How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time (Chapters 39–40) ===

Part VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

Chapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions.  Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton.  This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.

== About the book ==
It was published on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;  It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/bloomsburyacademic/docs/philosophy2013 Philosophy Books, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book answers the [[Expressivism#Objections to expressivism|Frege–Geach Problem]], the [[is ought problem|Fact–Value Gap]], and the [[Open Question Argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/63048 'Moral Philosophy for Elves' (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom)]&lt;/ref&gt; although the given answers have been challenged.&lt;ref name=Crocker /&gt;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt;

The book has been used to reconcile [[utilitarian]] and [[deontology|rules-based]] ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=Jeevan |last=D'Souza |title=On Measuring the Moral Value of Action |publisher= Philos, China |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeevan_Dsouza2/publication/301688068_On_Measuring_the_Moral_Value_of_Action/links/59d8ee11a6fdcc2aad0d86cf/On-Measuring-the-Moral-Value-of-Action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[humanism|Humanist]] psychologists have used the book to explain why only proven phenomena is needed to prove why morality exists, and what the parameters of morality should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=Albert A. |last=Johnstone |title=Why Morality? |publisher= The Humanistic Psychologist, 46(2), 188-203. | date=2018-06-01 |url=https://insights.ovid.com/humanistic-psychologist/thum/2018/06/000/why-morality/6/00011905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Theists have commented on the way the book grounds ethics without recourse to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Atheism and Theism, A Grounding of Ethics |publisher= Red Pill Religion |date=2017-12-27 |url=https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/12/27/atheism-theism-grounding-ethics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been used in freshman philosophy classes, to teach teenagers,&lt;ref name=Monteath /&gt; and in [[SAT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-practice-test-2.pdf College Board, College Readiness, SATs 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">In general usage the word '''indigen''' is treated as a variant of the word indigene, meaning a native.

==Usage in botany==
However, it was used in a strictly botanical sense for the first time in 1918 by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] ((1858–1954) an American horticulturist, botanist and cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science) and described as a plant 

&lt;blockquote&gt; " ''of known habitat'' ".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1918. The indigen and the cultigen. ''Science'' ser. 2, 47:306-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt; Later, in 1923, Bailey formally defined the indigen as:

=== Botanical definition ===
&lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''a species of which we know the nativity, - one that is somewhere recorded as indigenous''. "&lt;/blockquote&gt; The term was coined to contrast with [[cultigen]] which he defined in the 1923 paper as: &lt;blockquote&gt; " ... ''the species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication, – the plant is cultigenous.''"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1923. Various cultigens, and transfers ijuent change (see entry under [[cultigen]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS)''' is a teaching and research institute of the [[University of Tasmania]] in Hobart, Tasmania. IMAS was established in 2010 building upon the university’s partnership with [[CSIRO]] Oceans and Atmosphere and the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] in cooperative [[Antarctic]] research and [[Southern Ocean]] research.&lt;ref name="IMAS Strategic Plan 2012-2017"&gt;[http://www.imas.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/327317/UNW_3290_IMAS_StrategicPlan_logos_page33.pdf], IMAS Strategic Plan ''2012-2017''&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine geophysicist Prof Mike Coffin was appointed founding Executive Director of IMAS in 2010. Prof Richard Coleman, an oceanographer and cryospheric scientist, was appointed Executive Director of IMAS in July 2015.

==Mission statement==
''“To improve understanding of temperate marine, Southern Ocean, and Antarctic environments, their resources, and their roles in the global climate system through research, education, and outreach”''.&lt;ref name="IMAS Strategic Plan 2012-2017" /&gt;

==Research themes==
The Institute takes a multidisciplinary, whole-system approach to research, education, and outreach. IMAS was established with a core research and education capability, initially consisting of significant and internationally recognised expertise in the following foundation themes:&lt;ref name="IMAS Strategic Plan 2012-2017" /&gt;

* Oceans and cryosphere
* Fisheries and aquaculture
* Ecology and biodiversity

These programs are linked by three key cross-disciplinary themes to meet integrative and multidisciplinary research goals:
* Climate change
* Ocean-Earth system
* Ocean and Antarctic governance

==Excellence in Research Australia==
The Australian Research Council’s (ARC) Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) initiatives provide a specific benchmark for the core IMAS disciplines of [[oceanography]] and [[fisheries]] sciences, and in 2012 IMAS strongly contributed to the University of Tasmania achieving grade 5 scores (well above world standard) in oceanography, [[ecology]], and [[geology]], and a grade 4 score (above world standard) in fisheries sciences.&lt;ref name="Excellence in Research for Australia Initiative"&gt;[http://www.utas.edu.au/research/research-news/research-excellence-places-utas-among-the-best], Excellence in Research Australia Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies 20171117-005.jpg|thumb|right|IMAS building on Castray Esplanade, Hobart.]]
A new ~69,000 m² building on the Hobart waterfront was completed in 2013, to co-locate IMAS, Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS), the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC), and the Tasmanian Partnership for Advanced Computing (TPAC) staff and students. The new building, adjacent to CSIRO, will create an exceptional research and educational environment supported by state-of-the-art technology, and will serve as a hub for collaborative marine and Antarctic studies. The project is an initiative of the Australian Government as part of the Education Investment Fund.&lt;ref name="EIF Fund"&gt;[http://www.innovation.gov.au/highereducation/Funding/EducationInvestmentFund/Pages/Round2Information.aspx#announcements], Australian Government Education Investment Fund Round 2 Information&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning is under way for existing research and educational infrastructure totalling ~4,500 m2 south of Hobart at Taroona to be significantly expanded with new aquaculture and controlled-environment experimental saltwater facilities. Planned new capabilities include temperate/polar ocean simulations, and greatly enhanced aquaculture research.&lt;ref name="IMAS Strategic Plan 2012-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name='EAF Article'&gt;[http://www.imas.utas.edu.au/right-column-content/whats-new3/news/$5-million-for-new-utas-centres-a-step-change-in-research], $5 million for new UTAS centres a 'step change' in research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
* [[Australian Antarctic Division]]
* Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Co-operative Research Centre (to be co-located with IMAS)
* [[CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research]]
* Integrated Marine Observing System (to be co-located with IMAS)
* Tasmanian Partnership in Advanced Computing (to be co-located with IMAS)
* National Centre for Marine Conservation and Resource Sustainability at the AMC (NCMCRS),
* Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, University of Tasmania
* [[Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific]]

The '''International Research Center for Traditional Polyphony''' ('''IRCTP''' or '''Polyphonic Center''') is an academic organization focused on the study of the phenomenon of traditional [[vocal]] [[polyphony]]. It is a part of [[Tbilisi Vano Sarajishvili State Conservatory]]. Establishment of IRCTP was announced during the First International Symposium of Traditional Polyphony in 2002, and it was logistically established by the order of the Rector of [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in February 2003. Its director is Rusudan Tsurtsumia. The head of its International Bureau is [[Joseph Jordania]]. Central activity of the Polyphonic Center is organizing [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]], with subsequent publication of the presented papers, fostering dissemination of the knowledge on human musical cultures and establishing close professional contacts between ethnomusicologists interested in study of the phenomenon of traditional [[choral singing]].

==History ==
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been known among ethnomusicologists as the country with extremely rich traditions of [[vocal]] [[polyphony]] since the 1920s. Study of vocal polyphony has been one of the central issues for Georgian ethnomusicology from the second half of the 19th century. In 1972 [[Union of Composers]] of [[Soviet Union]] organized the conference dedicated to traditional polyphony in Georgia (this was the very first conference in the world, fully dedicated to traditional polyphony). The ongoing series of [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|conferences]] dedicated to the problems of traditional polyphony, with the wide participation of the experts from Soviet Union, Europe and America, were organized in 1984, 1986 and 1988. The following conference (scheduled in 1990) was initially postponed and later canceled due to the political instability in post-soviet Georgia. The series of biannual conferences on traditional polyphony were revived in 1998 and 2000, leading to the organizing of the First International Symposium on Traditional Polyphony in 2002. The first symposium was preceded by proclamation of Georgian traditional polyphony among the '''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''' by [[UNESCO]] in 2001. Representative of '''UNESCO''' attended the Symposium, providing support of '''UNESCO'''. The Polyphonic Centre has been supported during the recent years by the Presidents of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and [[Mikhail Saakashvili]]. For several years the Polyphonic Centre was also supported by the Japanese government.
There has been a steady increase in interest towards the study of traditional [[polyphony]] ([[choral singing]]) during the recent years. In the 1970s there were two initial conferences organized on this subject, in the 1980s four conference, in the 1990s three conferences, and during the first decade of the 21st century nine conferences had been organized in several countries (apart from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in [[Taiwan]] in 2002, in Austria in 2005 and 2008, in [[Portugal]] in 2007). A centre for the study of European traditional polyphony was established at [[Vienna University]] in 2005, and the study group on multipart music of [[ICTM]] was established in 2009 and organized a conference in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2010. The earliest international organization to dedicate its activity entirely to study of traditional choral singing was '''Polifonies Vivante''', organized in France during the 1991-1994 by [[Simha Arom]].

==International symposia==
[[International]] [[Academic conference|symposia]] on the problems of traditional polyphony had been organized biannually from 2002. The last one was held on September 26 - October 1, 2016. All of them had been organized in late September - early October, at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. The geography of representation of scholars from different countries of the world had been steadily increasing. A group of international expert-ethnomusicologists, including [[Simha Arom]] from France, Dieter Christensen from the United States, Franz Fodermayr from Austria, Polo Vallejo from Spain, had been participating in virtually every symposia, together with ethnomusicologists from different countries (including experts from China, Japan, Australia, Canada, eastern and western [[Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]]. The general program of the symposia is stable and contains twelve themes, covering wide range of research topics, including problems of [[vocal]] and [[instrumental]] polyphony, [[Folk music|folk]] and [[church music]], regional styles, elements of [[musical language]], [[social]] and [[gender]] aspects, history, links with [[popular music]]al styles. Participating scholars are traditionally provided by the hosts with hotel accommodation, internal transport and food during the Symposium. In 2010 for the first time a special theme was added (''vocal polyphony is Asia''). 2012 symposium (September 24–29) had the special theme ''comparative research in traditional polyphony'', 2014 Symposium main theme was ''Polyphony in Minority Music'' (September 22–26, 2014), and 2016 symposium was dedicated to the geographic dynamics of traditional polyphony (September 26 - October 1, 2016). Next symposium is planning to a later date: October 29 - November 3, 2018.

==Publications==
The most important publication of the IRCTP is the [[proceedings]] of the [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]]. They are usually prepared under the editorship of Rusudan Tsurtsumia and [[Joseph Jordania]]. All the papers of the previous symposia are freely available on the website of the IRCTP on both Georgian and English languages &lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.polyphony.ge/en/proceedings/ Papers presented at the Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulletins are another periodic publication of the IRCTP &lt;ref&gt;[http://polyphony.ge/en/category/publications-2/bulletin/ Bulletins of the Polyphonic Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Centre also published several collections of the articles, including '''Seventeen Arguments on Georgian Polyphony''' and numerous audio and video materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">An '''international medical graduate''' ('''IMG'''), earlier known as a '''foreign medical graduate''' ('''FMG'''), is a [[physician]] who has graduated from a medical school outside of the country where he or she intends to practice. Generally, the medical school of graduation is one listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as accredited by the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] or the [[World Health Organization]].

Medical schools around the world vary in education standards, curricula, and evaluation methods. Many countries have their own certification program, equivalent to the ECFMG in the United States. The purpose of [[ECFMG]] Certification is to assess the readiness of international medical graduates to enter clinical specialty training programs as [[resident physician]]s and fellowship programs in the United States.

== License requirements by country ==

The requirements to obtain a license to practice varies by country and often by state or province.

===Australia===
{{main article|Overseas trained doctors in Australia}}

IMGs (or Overseas Trained Doctors) who wish to be licensed in [[Australia]] must apply to the [[Australian Medical Council|Australian Medical Council (AMC)]] to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/pub/downloads/359-applying-to-amc|title=IMG guides:   Applying to the Australian Medical Council| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including AMC MCQ Exam and AMC clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring.

For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of Gyne and pediatrics.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613222254/http://www.amc.org.au/prelim1.asp]

Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia.

In 2010 the [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)]] launched an [[Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates]] which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/overseasdoctors/report.htm | title=Inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors | publisher= Parliament of Australia | accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several organizations have put pressure on the government such as the Association For Access to Health Care Services, and Association of International Physicians and Surgeons of [[Ontario]]. Bill 97, Increasing Access to Qualified Health Professionals for Ontarians Act, was passed in 2008, requiring the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to provide adequate numbers of doctors by issuing transitional licenses. However, the college has not complied with the law.

In addition to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada|LMCC]] Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have a harder time getting into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates &amp;mdash; only ten percent of IMG applicants get a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/why-canada-shutting-out-doctors readersdigest.ca - Why Is Canada Shutting Out Doctors?]: "In 2003, 625 international graduates competed. Only 67—about ten percent—found a position"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of United States M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs and are thus exempt from the Evaluating Examination; graduates of U.S. osteopathic medical schools ''are'' considered IMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcc.ca/en/exams/ee/apply.shtml |title=Evaluating Examination: Apply |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:2007ACGME-2.PNG|250px|right]][[Image:2007ACGME-3.PNG|250px|right]]
Graduates of Canadian M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2010ib/ibfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: 1.

The purpose of ECFMG Certification is to assess whether graduates of these schools are ready to enter U.S. residency and fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian physician with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] are qualified to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]]. However, since the 2010s, the process of obtaining a license was becoming increasingly complicated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; India has exported more physicians to the United States than any other foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16774871&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathway====
The main pathway for IMGs who wish to be licensed as physicians in the [[United States]] is to complete a U.S. [[residency (medicine)|residency]] hospital program. The general method to apply for residency programs is through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (abbreviated NRMP, also called "the Match"). To participate in the NRMP, an IMG is required to have an [[ECFMG certification]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "rank order list certification deadline" time (usually in February of the year of the match).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire an ECFMG certification, the main requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html ecfmg.org &gt; Medical Education Credentials] Last update: September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Completion of [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*A medical diploma of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, regular graduates from medical schools in the United States and Canada need to complete USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well, but can participate in the NRMP while still doing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, taking regular administrative delays into account, and with residency programs starting around July, there is a gap of at least half a year for IMGs between graduation from medical school and beginning of a residency program.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary [[USMLE]] exams and obtained the ECFMG certification can then apply to U.S. residency positions via the [[NRMP]] and [[Electronic Residency Application Service|ERAS]].

USMLE exam scores are considered in the [[National Resident Matching Program#International medical graduates|matching process]] for entering a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Catherine Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html|title=Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors|publisher=New York Times|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study came to the result that almost half of IMGs were unsuccessful in their first attempts in the pursuit of a U.S. residency position, and three-quarters began a residency after five years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742193?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Participation in U.S. Graduate Medical Education by Graduates of International Medical Schools] By Jolly, Paul PhD; Boulet, John PhD; Garrison, Gwen PhD; Signer, Mona M. MPH. Posted: 05/23/2011; ''Academic Medicine''. 2011;86(5):559-564.&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated that IMGs were considerably older when they first applied for a residency position than are most U.S. medical graduates, with mean age of IMGs when the ECFMG certificate was issued being 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 5.8 years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011/&gt;

All applicants to residency programs in [[California]] need a ''{{visible anchor|Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter}}'' (PTAL), colloquially called a "California Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ö/www.ecfmg.org/eras/applicants-documents-pta.html Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter (PTAL) or “California Letter”], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]]. Last updated June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtainment of a PTAL requires graduation from a [[medical school]] listed by the Medical Board of California, which is more stringent than the [[International Medical Education Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm.mednet.ucla.edu/IMG/residency/PTAL.asp University of California, Los Angeles - PTAL], Updated January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires having a [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Physicians_and_Surgeons/#8 The Medical Board of California - Physicians and Surgeons]. Retrieved May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[United States visa|visa]] requirements, non-U.S.-citizen doctors usually enter via the J1 or the H-1B visa. The J1 reqires a 2-year home residence after completion of training in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/immigration-information-international-medical-graduates|title=Immigration Information for International Medical Graduates|publisher=American Medical Association|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-1B visa does not have this 2-year home residence requirement, but further requires the [[USMLE Step 3]]. And initially, a B-1 visitor visa is required for taking the USMLE Step 2 clinical skills examination and the USMLE Step 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seak.com/blog/uncategorized/10-biggest-immigration-mistakes-physicians-make/|title=The 10 Biggest Immigration Mistakes Physicians Make|website=www.seak.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
One study examining quality of care by international medical graduates is noted as follows.  "One-quarter of practicing physicians in the United States are graduates of international medical schools. The quality of care provided by doctors educated abroad has been the subject of ongoing concern. Our analysis of 244,153 hospitalizations in Pennsylvania found that patients of doctors who graduated from international medical schools and were not U.S. citizens at the time they entered medical school had significantly lower mortality rates than patients cared for by doctors who graduated from U.S. medical schools or who were U.S. citizens and received their degrees abroad. The patient population consisted of those with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. We found no significant mortality difference when comparing all international medical graduates with all U.S. medical school graduates".&lt;ref name=Norcini_1467&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcini|2010|pp=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data on older Medicare patients admitted to hospital in the US showed that patients treated by international graduates had lower mortality than patients cared for by US graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j273 |title=Quality of care delivered by general internists in US hospitals who graduated from foreign versus US medical schools: observational study |publisher=BMJ |date=3 February 2017| doi=10.1136/bmj.j273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (for short, '''Ioffe Institute''', {{lang-ru|Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе}}) is one of [[Russia]]'s largest research centers specialized in [[physics]] and technology. The institute was established in 1918 in [[Petrograd]] (now St. Petersburg) and run for several decades by [[Abram Ioffe]]. The Institute is a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

== Present structure of the Institute ==
As of 2018, the Ioffe institute employs about 1500 people, around 1000 of whom are scientific researchers (including 560 with a PhD degree and 250 with a [[Doktor Nauk]] degree). 
Most of the research staff members are top graduates of the St. Petersburg (former Leningrad) universities. 

From 2013 till mid-May 2018 the Ioffe institute was under formal jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO Russia), now it is under jurisdiction of the established in May 2018 [[Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Russia)|Ministry of Science and Higher Education]], like all other institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS).

The Institute is organized into five divisions:
* Center for Nano-Heterostructure Physics
* Solid State Electronics
* [[Solid State Physics]]
* [[Plasma Physics]], Atomic Physics and [[Astrophysics]]
* Physics of [[Dielectrics]] and [[Semiconductor]]s
Each of the divisions includes several laboratories. The institute has its own graduate school and a scientific council. There exists an intensive collaboration with the research and industrial establishments in Russia and worldwide.

The institute publishes four scientific journals: ''Semiconductors'' ({{lang-ru|Физика и техника полупроводников}}), ''Physics of the Solid State'' ({{lang-ru|Физика твёрдого тела}}) and ''Technical Physics'' (journal + letters) ({{lang-ru|Журнал технической физики (основной + письма}})).

== Founding of the institute ==
The foundation date of the Ioffe Institute is September 23, 1918 – the day of signing the decree on the establishment of the physical and technical department in the (established in March of the same year) State Roentgenological and Radiological Institute in [[Petrograd]]. Despite tremendous economic problems after the World War I and the [[October Revolution]] (1917), the development of science was one of the priorities of the new Communist government. 

[[File:Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе. Вид с Политехнической ул. Ограда 3.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The entrance plaque, preserved from the Soviet times]]
The abovementioned department was headed by [[Abram Ioffe|A. F. Ioffe]]. In 1922, on its basis, the State Physicotechnical Radiology Institute has emerged. After several reorganizations and renaming, since 1933, the institute became “Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute”. The form “Physicotechnical” is a Russian variant for “Physical &amp; Technical”. Three decades later, in the 1960s, the word “Ioffe” was added to the institute name, in honor of the first director. 

Since 1939, the Institute has been a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (since 1991 – of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1967, it was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. These details were reflected in the institute name, especially in Russian. Also now, for historical reasons, there remained the entrance plaque (s. photo): “Academy of Sciences of the USSR, A. F. Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, awarded the Order of Lenin” ({{lang-ru|Oрдена Ленина Физико-технический институт им. А. Ф. Иоффе АН СССР}}).  

Presently, in English texts, for example in scientific papers, the name “[А. F.] Ioffe [Physical-Technical] Institute [of the Russian Academy of Sciences]” is used (the optional fragments are enclosed in square brackets). 

== Main scientific achievements ==
The Ioffe Institute is considered the cradle of Soviet physics. Such outstanding scientists as [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], [[Pyotr Kapitsa|P. L. Kapitsa]] started their career here, many physicists — among them [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Y. B. Zeldovich]], [[Igor Kurchatov|I. V. Kurchatov]], [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] — have worked at the Institute for some time.

The research of the Institute covers nearly all fields of the contemporary physics, including the solid-state, semiconductors, quantum electronics, astrophysics, plasma, fluid dynamics, cosmology, nuclear synthesis. 

More than 100 employees of the Institute were recognized by awarding the highest prizes and orders of the Soviet Union and of Russia – in particular the Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR, State Prizes of Russia, Government prizes and special prizes of the Soviet/Russian Academy of Sciences.

Twice, the Nobel Prize was awarded for the works performed at the Ioffe Institute. In 1956, academician [[Nikolay Semyonov|N. N. Semyonov]] (together with [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|C. N. Hinshelwood]]) got the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for a discovery and study of [[Chain reaction|chain reactions]]: the works were made and published in 1927, when N. N. Semyonov was a staff member of the Institute. In 2000, [[Zhores Alferov|Zh. I. Alferov]], director of the Ioffe Institute at that time, became a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize laureate in Physics]] (together with [[Herbert Kroemer|H. Kroemer]] and [[Jack Kilby|J. Kilby]]) for the development of semiconductor heterostructures for high-speed optoelectronics.

The Ioffe Institute has played a central role in the development of photovoltaic solar power in Russia and internationally, and thus in the development of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289325179_Russian_renewable_energy_The_potential_for_international_cooperation?_iepl%5BgeneralViewId%5D=OStyJJLs4S7luUUqaA1Fgqd0DanTtxPXfOHk&amp;_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=searchReact&amp;_iepl%5BviewId%5D=Lpu67iamSHgmLs0G5oXdoM4C869MSvhr7uPn&amp;_iepl%5BsearchType%5D=publication&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BcountLessEqual20%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BinteractedWithPosition1%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bdata%5D%5BwithoutEnrichment%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5Bposition%5D=1&amp;_iepl%5BrgKey%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A289325179&amp;_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle|title=Russian Renewable Energy: The Potential for International Cooperation|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=Kjaernet|first2=Heidi|publisher=Asghate|year=2009|isbn=|location=Farnham|pages=48, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main building of the Ioffe Institute (s. photo at the top of the article and the very left part of the photo below) is located at Polytechnicheskaya Street, 26. It was built in a [[Neoclassicism]] style in 1912–1916 by the architect G. D. Grimm and served as "a refuge for the elderly needy hereditary noblemen in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Romanovs' house" at the forty-prized ones, on the second floor they arranged Church (now the Small Assembly Hall of the Institute).&lt;ref&gt; Глезеров С.

[[File:KurchatovStr.jpg|thumb|300px|Buildings belonging to the Ioffe Institute; this photo was shot from the Academician Ioffe square]]
In 1920 the building was adapted to the Institute by the design of civil engineers P. I. Sidorov and Yu. V. Bilinsky. The ceremonial transfer of the building to the Institute took place on February 4, 1923. Until 1953, the apartment of A. F. Ioffe was located in the same building.&lt;ref&gt;Алфёров Ж. И.

Beyond this historical building, a more modern building on another side of the Kurchatov Street (the right part of the photo) also belongs to the Ioffe Institute. It was constructed in the 1970s. Furthermore, some laboratories of the Ioffe Institute are placed in Shuvalovo, a north-west outskirts of St. Petersburg.  

In front of the main facade are the busts of [[Abram Ioffe]] (sculptor G. D. Glickman, 1964) and [[Boris Konstantinov]] (sculptor [[Mikhail Anikushin]], 1975). On either side of the main entrance are memorial plaques: to the left of the entrance are S. N. Zhurkov, [[Yulii Borisovich Khariton]], [[Anatoly Alexandrov (physicist)|Anatoly Alexandrov]], [[Yakov Frenkel]], and {{ill|Vladimir Tuchkevich|lt=V. M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">A '''methylene blue active substances assay''', or '''MBAS assay''', is a [[colorimetric analysis]] [[test method]] that uses [[methylene blue]] to detect the presence of [[anionic]] [[surfactant]]s (such as a [[detergent]] or [[foaming agent]]) in a sample of [[water]]. An anionic surfactant detected by the [[color reaction]] is called a ''methylene blue active substance'' (MBAS).&lt;ref&gt;Alison L. George, Graham F. White "Optimization of the methylene blue assay for anionic surfactants added to estuarine and marine water" Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 1999, Volume 18, pages 2232–2236.
{{DOI|10.1002/etc.5620181016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After first acidifying a water sample (with [[boric acid]], for example), one adds to it [[chloroform]] and a [[solution]] of methylene blue et al.&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0648:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents]&lt;/ref&gt; Methylene blue is a [[cationic]] [[dye]]. The [[Phase (matter)|biphasic]] solution is then [[Agitator (device)|agitated]] to distribute these [[reagent]]s throughout the aqueous and organic phases.&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex" /&gt; If an anionic surfactant is present, then the cationic methylene blue and the anionic surfactant forms an ion pair, which is extracted into the organic phase. The [[color saturation]] of the chloroform increases with the concentration of anionic surfactants.

MBAS assay is an [[ASTM International]] standard technique for detecting anionic surfactants.&lt;ref name="astm"&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/D2330.htm ASTM D2330 - 02 Standard Test Method for Methylene Blue Active Substances]&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[carboxylate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[sulfonate]]s. An MBAS assay alone does not, however, identify specific surfactants. ASTM withdrew the standard (ASTM D2330-02) in 2011 pending a review and update of the method, which was last approved in 2003.&lt;ref name="astm" /&gt;

Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater list the following methods used by certified laboratories testing wastewater in the United States:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmethods.org/store/ProductView.cfm?ProductID=43 Standard Methods: 5540 Surfactants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220225/http://www.standardmethods.org/store/ProductView.cfm?ProductID=43 |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Method 5540B describes surfactant separation by sublation. 
*Method 5540C discusses anionic surfactants as methylene blue active substances (MBAS). 
*Method 5540D discusses nonionic surfactants as cobalt thiocyanate active substances (CTAS).

'''Maeshowe''' (or '''Maes Howe'''; ''[[Old Norse|Norse]]'': '''Orkhaugr'''&lt;ref name=OJ/&gt;) is a [[Neolithic]] [[chambered cairn]] and [[passage grave]] situated on [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. It was probably built around {{nowrap|2800 BC}}. In the archaeology of Scotland, it gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairn, which is limited to Orkney. Maeshowe is a significant example of Neolithic craftsmanship and is, in the words of the archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]], "a superlative monument that by its originality of execution is lifted out of its class into a unique position."&lt;ref&gt;Pigott 1954&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments around Maeshowe, including [[Skara Brae]], were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1999.

==Design and construction==
Maeshowe is one of the largest tombs in Orkney; the mound encasing the tomb is {{convert|115|ft|m}} in diameter and rises to a height of {{convert|24|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Childe 1952, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding the mound, at a distance of {{convert|50|ft|m}} to {{convert|70|ft|m}} is a ditch up to {{convert|45|ft|m}} wide. The grass mound hides a complex of passages and chambers built of carefully crafted slabs of [[flagstone]] weighing up to 30 tons.&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Worlds'': "The Pagans (of Britain)" History Channel series with contributions from historian Prof. Ronald Hutton, Archeologists Erika Guttmann and Martin Carruthers&lt;/ref&gt; It is aligned so that the rear wall of its central chamber held up by a bracketed wall,&lt;ref&gt;Dargie 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; is illuminated on the [[winter solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; A similar display occurs in [[Newgrange]].

This entrance passage is {{convert|36|ft|m}} long and leads to the central almost square chamber measuring about {{convert|15|ft|m}} on each side.&lt;ref&gt;Childe 1952, pp.18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The current height of the chamber is {{convert|12.5|ft|m}}, this reflects the height to which the original stonework is preserved and capped by a modern [[corbelled]] roof. The original roof may have risen to a height of {{convert|15|ft|m}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1995, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance passage is only about {{convert|3|ft|m}} high, requiring visitors to stoop or crawl into the central chamber. That chamber is constructed largely of flat slabs of stone, many of which traverse nearly the entire length of the walls. In each corner lie huge angled buttresses that rise to the vaulting. At a height of about {{convert|3|ft|m}}, the wall's construction changes from the use of flat to overlapping slabs creating a beehive-shaped vault.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 1987, pp. 176-177&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the amount of effort required to build Maeshowe vary; a commonly suggested number is 39,000 man-hours,&lt;ref&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 1987, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Colin Renfrew]] calculated that at least 100,000 hours would be required.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew 1979, p. 212-214&lt;/ref&gt; Dating of the construction of Maeshowe is difficult but dates derived from burials in similar tombs cluster around {{nowrap|3000 BC}}. Since Maeshowe is the largest and most sophisticated example of the Maeshowe "type" of tomb, archaeologists have suggested that it is the last of its class, built around {{nowrap|2800 BC}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1981, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The people who built Maeshowe were users of [[grooved ware]],&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew 1985, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; a distinctive type of pottery that spread throughout the British Isles from about {{nowrap|3000 BC}}.

==Siting==
Maeshowe appears as a grassy mound rising from a flat plain near the southeast end of the [[Loch]] of [[Harray]]. The land around Maeshowe at its construction probably looked much as it does today: treeless with grasses representative of Pollen Assemblage Zone MNH-I reflecting "mixed agricultural practices, probably with a pastoral bias – there is a substantial amount of [[Plantago|ribwort]] pollen, but also that of cereals."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson &amp; Jones 1985, pp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Maeshowe is aligned with some other Neolithic sites in the vicinity, for example the entrance of "Structure 8" of the nearby [[Barnhouse Settlement]] directly faces the mound. In addition, the so-called "Barnhouse Stone" in a field around 700 metres away is perfectly aligned with the entrance to Maeshowe. This entrance corridor is so placed that it lets the direct light of the setting sun into the chamber for a few days each side of the [[winter solstice]], illuminating the entrance to the back cell.&lt;ref name="Monuments"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

A Neolithic "low road" connects Maeshowe with the magnificently preserved village of [[Skara Brae]], passing near the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]] and the [[Ring of Brodgar]].&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 1987, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Low roads connect Neolithic ceremonial sites throughout Britain. Some archeologists believe that Maeshowe was originally surrounded by a large stone circle.&lt;ref&gt;Lost Worlds: The Pagans (of Britain) History Channel series with contributions from historian Prof. Ronald Hutton, Archeologists Erika Guttmann and Martin Carruthers&lt;/ref&gt; The complex including Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar, the Standing Stones of Stenness, Skara Brae, as well as other tombs and standing stones represents a concentration of Neolithic sites that is rivalled in Britain only by the complexes associated with [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]].&lt;ref&gt;Castleden 1987, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The tomb gives its name to the Maeshowe type of Scottish chambered cairn, which is limited to Orkney.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1981, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Maeshowe is very similar to the famous [[Newgrange]] tomb in [[Ireland]], suggesting a linkage between the two cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Laing 1974, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chambered tomb]]s of the Maeshowe "type" are characterized by a long, low entrance passageway leading to a square or rectangular chamber from which there is access to a number of side cells. Although there are disagreements as to the attribution of tombs to tomb types, there are only seven definitely known Maeshowe type tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]], there are, in addition to Maeshowe; the tombs of [[Cuween Hill Chambered Cairn|Cuween Hill]], Wideford Hill, and Quanterness. The tomb of Quoyness is found on Sanday, while Vinquoy Hill is located on [[Eday]]. Finally, there is an unnamed tomb on the [[Holm of Papa|Holm of Papa Westray]]. Anna Ritchie reports that there are three more Maeshowe type tombs in Orkney but she doesn't name or locate them.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1995, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the description herein, a [[Chamber tomb|chambered tomb]] is normally characterized by grave goods, which were found at Cuween Hill and the tomb on Holm of Papa Westray (see the paragraph above) but were not found at Maeshowe.  Further, the description of a [[passage grave]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;states: "Not all passage graves have been found to contain evidence of human remains. One such example is Maeshowe." In addition, the Statement of Significance (cited below in the section describing the Maeshowe World Heritage designation) says, "It is an expression of genius within a group of people whose other tombs were claustrophobic chambers in smaller mounds.".

A potential explanation for the extraordinary genius of Maeshowe engineering and the lack of human remains was described by Tompkins (1971) who compared the structure at "Maes-Howe" to the Great Pyramid (p.&amp;nbsp;130-133), suggesting the site was used as an observatory, calendar, and for May Day ceremonies rather than as a tomb.

Tompkins (1971) extensively studied numerous documents related to the measurement and exploration of the Great Pyramid of Giza. He stated the central "observation chamber" (p.&amp;nbsp;130) at Maeshowe was "corbeled like the Great Pyramid's Grand Gallery", was carefully leveled, plumbed", and the jointing is of a quality that "rivals that of the Great Pyramid". Rather than chambers of a tomb, Tompkins suggested the structure contained small "retiring rooms for the observers" (p.&amp;nbsp;130). He suggested the entrance was very similar to Egyptian pyramids in that it had a "54-foot observation passage aimed like a telescope at a megalithic stone [2772 ft. away] to indicate the summer solstice" (p.&amp;nbsp;130) in addition to its "Watchstone" to the West that indicated the equinoxes. The "sighting passage" (p.&amp;nbsp;133) points to a northern star like the pyramids of Saqqara, Dashur and Medûm. Tompkins stated that "The similarity [of the pyramids] to the structure at Maes-Howe is indeed amazing" (p.&amp;nbsp;133). He cited Professor Alexander Thom, former Chair of Engineering Science at Oxford, as writing about the geometry of construction and astronomical alignment of Maeshowe in this context in 1967 (Tompkins, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;137-138).

Tompkins (1971), citing Thom (1967) and others, described in detail how Maeshowe, Silbury Hill (Tompkins, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;128) and other ancient mounds and Neolithic megaliths across Britain served as extremely accurate observatories, calendars, and straight-line beacons for travelers, as well as how they were used ceremonially in May Day celebrations more than 4000 years ago.

==Excavation==
[[File:Maes Howe 1861.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Maeshowe soon after opening in 1861]]
The "modern" opening of the tomb was by [[James Farrer]], an antiquarian and the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[South Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|South Durham]], in July 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1995, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Farrer, like many antiquarians of the day, was not noted for his careful excavation of sites. John Hedges describes him as possessing "a rapacious appetite for excavation matched only by his crude techniques, lack of inspiration, and general inability to publish."&lt;ref&gt;Hedges 1984, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Farrer and his workmen broke through the roof of the entrance passage and found it filled with debris. He then turned his attention to the top of the mound, broke through and, over a period of a few days, emptied the main chamber of material that had filled it completely. He and his workmen discovered the famous [[runic]] inscriptions carved on the walls, proof that Norsemen had broken into the tomb at least six centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 1995, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the [[Orkneyinga Saga]], Maeshowe was looted by the famous [[Vikings]] [[Harald Maddadsson|Earl Harald Maddadarson]] and Ragnvald, Earl of Møre&lt;ref name=OJ&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/maeshrunes.htm "Maeshowe's runes - Viking graffiti"] Orkneyjar. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; in about the 12th century. The more than thirty [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions on the walls of the chamber represent the largest single collection of such carvings in the world. More recent fieldwork has demonstrated that the application of computational photography technique, [[Reflectance Transformation Imaging|RTI]] (RTI) can shed light onto the nature of the inscriptions and their sequencing.&lt;ref name='IA'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nicole Smith |author2=Gareth Beale |author3=Julian Richards |author4=Nela Scholma-Mason |title=Maeshowe: The Application of RTI to Norse Runes  |journal=[[Internet Archaeology]] |volume=47 |date=2018 |url=http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue47/8/index.html |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations have revealed that the external wall surrounding the ditch was rebuilt in the 9th century. Some archaeologists see this as evidence that the tomb may have been reused by the Norse people and that they were the source of the "treasure" found by the later looters.&lt;ref name="Monuments"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wickham-Jones|first=Caroline|title=Monuments of Orkney|publisher=Historic Scotland|date=2012|isbn=978-1-84917-073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name ''Maeshowe'' is uncertain.  While the second element is certainly from the Old Norse ''[[Old Norse language|haugr]]'' usually meaning a mound, there have been several different theories postulated for the first element, ''maes''.

These include:
*Celtic origins. The Welsh word "Maes", meaning "field" or "area of activity"; it is typical for "maes" to be followed by an adjective, such as "fair field", "Maes teg". "Maeshowe" might then mean "the burial mound field", or "the area around the cairn".  Due to the rarity of surviving pre-Norse elements in Orcadian placenames, this theory does not enjoy much support.
*A personal name. "Maeshowe" could simply be a corruption of "Tormis' Howe", meaning it was the burial mound of someone called Tormis.  Some other cairns in the area do seem to be named after individuals, and "Tormiston" is immediately adjacent to the tomb.
*Old Norse for "The Maiden's Tomb"? This would be ''meyjarhaugr'' or ''maerhaugr''.
*Old Norse for "The Great Tomb"? This would be ''mestrhaugr''.  Maeshowe is called ''Orkahaugr'' in the [[Orkneyinga Saga]].  The first element of that name, ''orka'', signifies power or greatness.

As the female regent Mae/May was seen as the principal head of the famous festival held by the adult females after the Spring equinox, today's 'Easter'. Within this context the name Maes Howe seem to reflect "May's Temple".

==World Heritage status==
The "[[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]]" was listed as a World Heritage site in December 1999. In addition to Maeshowe, the site includes [[Skara Brae]], the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]], the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and other nearby sites. It is managed by [[Historic Environment Scotland]], whose "Statement of Significance" for the site begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of civilisation&amp;nbsp;... Maes Howe is a masterpiece of Neolithic engineering. It is an exceptionally early architectural accomplishment. With its almost classical strength and simplicity it is a unique survival from 5000 years ago. It is an expression of genius within a group of people whose other tombs were claustrophobic chambers in smaller mounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/world_heritage_sites/world-heritage-neolithic-orkney.htm "The Heart of Neolithic Orkney"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824203938/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/policyandguidance/world_heritage_scotland/world_heritage_sites/world-heritage-neolithic-orkney.htm |date=24 August 2007 }}.

'''Medium theory''' is the name assigned to a variety of approaches used to examine how the means of expression of human communication impact the meaning(s) of human communication(s).

[[Joshua Meyrowitz]] originated the term in his 1985 book, ''No Sense of Place''.  Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1963, 1966, 1988) and [[Neil Postman]] (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German [[media theory]] operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia.

Joshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305).

==McLuhan's message==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is best known for his phrase "the medium is the message". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. "McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit."

==Technological determinism== 
Medium theory has always been criticized by its [[technological determinism]]. [[Raymond Williams]] is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it.
The deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although [[McLuhan]] strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Microfadeometry''' is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/services/scientific-scientifique/microfade-microvieillissement-eng.aspx Microfade Testing Service], Canadian Conservation Institute. (2014, June 2).&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra.

== History ==
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early [[art conservation]] studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Druzik, J. Oriel Microfading Tester (MFT): a Brief Description. ''Research and Technical Studies''. '''2010''', ''2'', 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Ford, B. Non-Destructive Microfade Testing at the National Museum of Australia. ''The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material Bulletin''. '''2011''', ''32'', 54-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Before the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Chiari, G. Conservation Science Investigation. ''International Preservation News''. '''2010''', ''50'', 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Using a powerful [[xenon arc lamp]], 1 lumen of light is focused through an [[optical fiber]] onto a 300–400&amp;nbsp;μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5–12 years of display at normal museum light levels.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;del Hoyo-Melendez, J. Micro-fading Spectrometry. ''Fibers and Polymers''. '''2012''', ''13'', 1079-1085.&lt;/ref&gt; The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400–710&amp;nbsp;nm using a water filter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Arnaud, C.H. [http://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i13/Shining-Light-Art.html Shining Light On Art],  Shining Light on Art. ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''. '''2009''', ''87'', 44-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.
Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the [[Blue Wool Scale]].&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Lerwill, A. [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v24/microfading-questioning-basics Microfading: Questioning the Basics], Microfading: Questioning the Basics. ''Image Permanence Institute Bulletin''. '''2013'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards,&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

(1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Monopolies of knowledge''' arise when the [[ruling class]] maintains political power through control of key communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of touch with social realities. Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise on the margins of society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'', introduced and edited by William Christian. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Innis]] developed the concept of monopolies of knowledge in his later writings on [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Monopolies of knowledge|communications theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Toronto: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurs in [[ancient Egypt]] where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long periods of apprenticeship and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's warnings about monopolies of knowledge take on particular urgency in the years immediately preceding his death in 1952. In his later writings, he argued that industrialization and mass media had led to the mechanization of a culture in which more personal forms of oral communication were radically devalued.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, pp.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reading is quicker than listening," Innis wrote in 1948. "The printing press and the radio address the world instead of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the concept ==

When discussing the monopolies of knowledge, Innis focuses much of his concern on the United States, where he feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive in the face of what he calls the "vast monopolies of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''The Strategy of Culture''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Carey]] notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," Carey writes. "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [magazine]."&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. (1992) ''Communication As Culture: Essays on Media and Society'', p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fashion his concept of monopolies of knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, including economics, history, communications and technology.

===Economics and the price system===

In his 1938 essay, ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', Innis anticipates his later concept of monopolies of knowledge.  Although he does not precisely define what he means by the "price system", he does show how trade and technology shaped modern industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.217-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis suggests, for example, that the shift from coal and iron to oil and electricity had profound implications that no one in industrial societies could escape. He mentions the growth of cities with people living in large apartment buildings made possible by developments in electrical equipment on the one hand, and the dispersal of populations over wide metropolitan areas as a result of the automobile and paved roads, on the other.

The inhabitants of modern industrial societies even eat differently than their more rural forebears. "The demands of population in congested areas, under the direction of scientific work in nutrition," Innis writes, "have shifted from carbohydrates to vitamins or from wheat to dairy products, live-stock, fruits and vegetables."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he adds, city dwellers are influenced by cheap, mass-circulation newspapers which peddle political stereotypes along with department store ads.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Essays), pp.266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the industrial economy monopolizes how people live, work, communicate and think.&lt;ref&gt;See, Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, pp.120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and classical studies===

Innis's concept of monopolies of knowledge was also influenced by the scholar [[Solomon Gandz]] who published a lengthy paper in 1939 on the significance of the [[oral tradition]] in the development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandz advanced the idea that the control of language in the oral tradition was grounded in religious institutions which ensured a civilization's continuity by preserving its traditions. At the same time, however, religious elites often shared their power with political elites who controlled the use of military force, thereby ensuring a civilization's success in conquering and holding territory.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.358-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis incorporated these ideas in his concept of [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Time and space|time-biased and space-biased media]]. He argued that civilizations and empires flourished when there was a [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Balance.2C bias and empire|balance]] between time- and space-biased media.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of one type of medium over the other, however, undermined stability demonstrating that unbalanced monopolies of knowledge could gradually lead to the decline and fall of civilizations and empires.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued this was, in fact, happening to Western civilization which had become [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Western civilization in peril|dangerously unbalanced]] partly because of the monopoly of knowledge exercised by space-biased communications technologies such as the daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the newspaper reflected an obsession with what he termed "present-mindedness".&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and the news agencies that served them could transmit large amounts of information over long distances, but this speed of transmission and the emphasis on immediacy obliterated continuity and memory. "Time," Innis wrote, "has been cut into pieces the length of a day's newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (1954) "Concept of Monopoly and Civilization." ''Explorations'', No. 3 quoted in Carey, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of electronic media—radio and later, television—added more speed and immediacy contributing cumulatively to the erasure of cultural memory. Moreover, these space-biased media could be used by political elites to mobilize large populations—as in [[Nazi Germany]]—to support disastrous wars of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of writing==

Innis placed special emphasis on monopolies of knowledge that are based on the control of written media. "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," he writes in [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C printing and speech|''Empire and Communications'']].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

"The sword and the pen worked together," Innis writes. "The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government. Small communities were written into large states and states were consolidated into empire." Innis adds that the monarchies of Egypt and Persia as well as the Roman empire "were essentially products of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's adoption of papyrus facilitated the [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C empire and religion|spread of writing]] and the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern vast territories.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp.120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of the alphabet strengthened monopolies of knowledge in a variety of ancient empires.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis warns about the power of writing to create mental "grooves" which determine "the channels of thought of readers and later writers."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing and paper===

Innis believed that the [[printing press]] was a decisive invention in the history of the West. [[Lewis Mumford]] pointed out that printing was "a completely mechanical achievement...the type for all future instruments of reproduction: for the printed sheet...was the first completely standardized product."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis (1946) ''Technics and Civilization''. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Innis, the printing press and the accompanying medium of paper ushered in not just the mechanization that would become characteristic of an industrial society based on mass production, but also the mechanization of knowledge itself. By that, Innis meant that printing led to the production of beliefs and practices that reinforced monopolies of knowledge characteristic of industrial culture.&lt;ref&gt;See, Innis, Harold (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'' introduced and edited by William Christian, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in the large-scale production of [[newsprint]] in the 19th century that had far-reaching effects. Newsprint fostered the development of big newspaper plants that needed larger numbers of readers to deliver to big advertisers such as [[department store]]s. Department stores themselves reflected new ways of marketing to rising numbers of city dwellers. To attract more readers, newspaper proprietors began to run [[comics]] and to rely on the "excitement and sensationalism" of foreign wars. Such coverage influenced British and American foreign policies, sometimes disastrously.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also warned that printed books could produce conformity of thought akin to the regimentation of workers in industrial factories.&lt;ref&gt;See Housser, Signe, ''Harold A. Innis and Michel Foucault: A Communications Perspective on Knowledge Construction''[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/7718/1/b16625535.pdf], MA Thesis, Simon Fraser University, 1984, pp.66-67. Housser draws on ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis''. 2/42, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeats the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|Biblical commandment against worshiping graven images]], but suggests that in our unconscious society, this prohibition is not interpreted to apply to the printed word.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Idea File), 1/1, p.3. Innis writes: "Thou shalt not worship any graven image—not interpreted to mean the printed word or those words themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Kuhns, societies dominated by print media regard only printed knowledge as "essentially valid." Textbook publishers exert a huge influence on education at all levels while schools and universities refuse to accept knowledge in other than printed forms. "The monopoly of knowledge protects its own with wary vigilance," Kuhns writes.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhns, William. (1971) ''The Post-Industrial Prophets: Interpretations of Technology''. New York: Weybright and Talley, pp.154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in Mumford's words, with the advent of the printed book, learning "became book-learning."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levinson]] writes that "[l]iteracy probably constitutes the most significant monopoly of knowledge in human history."&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Paul. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution''. New York: Routledge, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, however, that in open, democratic societies, public education systems are dedicated to breaking this monopoly by teaching students how to read and write, thereby giving them full access to printed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, pp.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==

We can look at the [[Internet]] as being a factor in creating knowledge monopolies. Those who have the skills to use the technology have the power to choose what information is communicated. The significance of the Internet in the creation of these monopolies, in more recent years, has been somewhat diminished due to increased knowledge and awareness of how to use the technology. At the same time, the ever-increasing complexity of digital technologies strengthens monopolies of knowledge as the ''New York Times'' points out in a series which began on April 27, 2009, called ''The Digital Arms Race'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country’s power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets — in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/us/28cyber.html?pagewanted=all]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wherever new media arise, so too do monopolies of knowledge concerning how to use the technologies to reinforce the power and control of elite groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">'''Moral evil''' is the result of any morally negative event caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent, such as a person. An example of a moral evil might be [[murder]], or any other [[evil]] event for which someone can be held responsible or culpable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Web. 13 Sept. 2014. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml Christianity: good and evil]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be contrasted with [[natural evil]], in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions.

The distinction of evil from 'bad' is complex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in [[ethics]].

The '''North South Atlantic Training Transect''' (NoSoAT) is a program that was developed by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] (AWI), the [[Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training]] (SMART), and the [[Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans]] (POGO) in order to further the education and practical training of postgraduate students in climate and [[marine science]]s. Each year, about 30 students are selected through a rigorous application process to join a voyage from [[Bremerhaven]], Germany to [[Cape Town]], South Africa aboard the [[RV Polarstern]]. The month-long course is designed to provide students with relevant lectures and projects, as well as provide them with hands-on training for the use of atmospheric and oceanographic equipment and the opportunity to learn about data processing and analysis.&lt;ref name=MIFnM&gt;{{cite web|title=Apply now to join North South Atlantic Training Transect (NoSoAT 2016) {{!}} Marine Institute|url=http://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/news-events/news/apply-now-join-north-south-atlantic-training-transect-nosoat-2016|website=Marine Institute Foras na Mara|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Closed: North South Atlantic Training Transect 2016 {{!}} SMART|url=http://www.smartseaschool.com/nosoat2016|website=Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the NoSoAT 2015 cruise had a strong focus in [[biological oceanography]], the NoSoAT 2016 cruise will be more focused in [[physical oceanography|physical]] and [[chemical oceanography]].&lt;ref name=MIFnM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Expedition2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knust|first1=Rainer|last2=Lochte|first2=Karin|title=The Expeditions PS95.1 and PS95.2 of the Research Vessel POLARSTERN to the Atlantic Ocean in 2015|journal=Berichte zur Polar- und Meeresforschung|volume=702|pages=1–72|doi=10.2312/BzPM_0702_2016|url=http://epic.awi.de/41683/1/BzPM_0702_2016.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different approaches to studying marine and climate sciences allow for groups of post-doctorate students to be specifically trained within their respective fields.

=== NoSoAT 2015 - Expeditions PS95.1 and PS95.2 ===
The cruise track covers a broad range of habitats for various organisms and a broad range of characteristically different waters. Data collected during this cruise came from equipment such as a [[CTD (instrument)|Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Sonde]], a [[Bongonet]], a [[Ferrybox]], and a [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] (CPR). Additionally, samples of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] were obtained and analyzed in conjunction with satellite data. Some preliminary results included the identification of three distinct water masses along the [[transect]], discrepancies in the comparison of ship-board [[chlorophyll a]] measurements with satellite-derived chlorophyll a data, latitudinal variations in the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum, and variations in the impact of [[microzooplankton]] grazing on phytoplankton communities.&lt;ref name=Expedition2015/&gt;

'''Paleolimnology''' ({{lang-el|paleon}}=old, ''limne''=lake, ''logos''=study) is a scientific subdiscipline closely related to both [[limnology]] and [[paleoecology]].  Palaeolimnological studies are concerned with reconstructing the [[paleoenvironment]]s of inland waters ([[lake]]s and [[streams]]; [[freshwater]], [[brackish]], or [[saline water|saline]]) – and especially changes associated with such events as [[climatic change]], human impacts (e.g., [[eutrophication]], or [[acid rain|acidification]]), and internal ontogenic processes.

Paleolimnological studies are commonly based on meticulous analyses of [[sediment]] cores, including the [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] properties of sediments, and diverse [[biology|biological]] records (e.g., fossil [[diatoms]], [[cladocera]], [[ostracodes]], [[molluscs]], [[pollen]], [[pigments]], or [[chironomid]]s). One of the primary sources for recent paleolimnological research is the Journal of Paleolimnology.

==History==

===Lake ontogeny===
Most early paleolimnological studies focused especially on the biological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in directing lake development.  Although [[Einar Naumann]] had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, [[August Thienemann]] suggested that the reverse process likely occurred.  Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, I. R. 1987.  Chironomidae (Diptera) in paleoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 6: 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson]] &amp; Wollack suggested that following an initial oligotrophic stage lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium.  They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities, and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonising organisms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

In a classic paper, [[Raymond Lindeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R. L. 1942. The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23, 399–418.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], [[mesotrophic lake|mesotrophic]], and [[eutrophic]] stages, before senescing to a [[dystrophic lake|dystrophic]] stage and filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin.  These ideas were further elaborated by [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]],&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., Jr. 1955. The obliteration of the hypolimmon. Mem. Ist. Ital. Idrobiol., Suppl 8, 9–38.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric [[eutrophication]].  As the [[hypolimnion]] of lakes gradually filled with sediments, [[oxygen]] depletion would promote the release of iron-bound [[phosphorus]] to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. 2006. Chironomid overview. pp.360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, Vo1. 1, Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely, if uncritically, accepted.  Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were effectively refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student [[Daniel A. Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, D.A. 1957. On the sigmoid growth phase in the history of Linsley Pond. American Journal of Science 255: 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Whiteside&lt;ref&gt;Whiteside. M. C. 1983. The mythical concept of eutrophication. Hydrobiologia 103, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's proposal, and palaeolimnologists now consider that a host of external  factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity.  Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the [[Younger Dryas]]) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, illustrating that 1) lake development is not a unidirectional process, and 2) climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

==Limnic Environment==
[[Limnology]] is study of inland water bodies including: lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, wetlands and more.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-07-023673-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change====
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used [[chironomid]] fossils to assess the impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic [[eutrophication]]) on lake communities. Their studies reveal pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes, a consequence of severe oxygen depletion in the eutrophied lakes.

From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to understanding the role of human impacts ([[acid rain]]) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of [[pH]] change in northern lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Battarbee, R. W. 1984. Diatom analysis and the acidification of lakes. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 305: 451–477.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pH]]-sensitivity of [[diatom]] communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when [[Friedrich Hustedt]] developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. [[Gunnar Nygaard (phycologist)|Gunnar Nygaard]] subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, [[Jouko Meriläinen]] introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function.  Using diatom and [[chrysophyte]] fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions.  Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.

In recent years palaeolimnologists have recognised that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct [[paleoclimate]]s.  Sensitive records of climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from [[chironomid]] fossils, and palaeosalinity records inferred from [[diatoms]].

==== Freshwater [http://extension.usu.edu/waterquality/whats-in-your-water/aquatic_macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates] ====
Freshwater macroinvertebrates ([[invertebrate]]s that can be see by naked eye; &gt; 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) are a very diverse group of small animals present in [[river]]s, streams, lakes and wetlands. These animals include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, annelids and arachnids. They comprise a functionally and taxonomically diverse group that plays an important role in linking the food web in the [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They serve as a main source of food for the fishes and they depend on different types of algae and bacteria for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J. Iwan|last2=Sayer|first2=Carl D.|title=DOES THE FISH–INVERTEBRATE–PERIPHYTON CASCADE PRECIPITATE PLANT LOSS IN SHALLOW LAKES?|journal=Ecology|date=August 2003|volume=84|issue=8|pages=2155–2167|doi=10.1890/02-0422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most aquatic macro-invertebrates are small while some are quite large such as freshwater crayfish. They are very sensitive to different physical and chemical conditions and respond to it accordingly due to their limited mobility. For example, their community will change when a pollutant enters into the water or due to the change of [[water quality]]. Therefore, the water body which is rich with a macro-invertebrate community can be used to provide an estimate of water body health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Marc|title=Water: Facts without Myths|journal=Water|date=7 August 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.3390/w1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Macro invertebrates termed "benthos" inhabit surfaces of vegetation, rocks and other aquatic sediments. They are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and present at a range of trophic levels. Most  macroinvertebrates taxa are dependent on a range of [[abiotic factor]]s and [[biotic factor]]s and therefore community structure can be used to represent the local ecosystem. These factors may be the availability and quality of food, [[pH]], [[temperature]], salinity, land use pattern and [[water flow]] etc. These factors are interconnected and influence each other. For example, any change in the land use affects the riparian vegetation that may be increased or decreased which changes the inputs into the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|last2=Gresens|first2=Susan|last3=Kenney|first3=Melissa|last4=Sutton-Grier|first4=Ariana|title=Benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality: The intersection of science and policy|journal=Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–128|doi=10.1163/187498209X12525675906077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all of these reasons, macroinvertabrates are considered as one of the best indicators of water quality.

===== Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates =====
Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates vary in their tolerance to changes in the aquatic environment.

===== Macroinvertebrates as an indicator of [[water quality]] =====
Macroinvertebrateas are commonly and widely distributed in many types of water bodies and respond with a range of sensitivities to many kinds of stressors. They are commonly used for toxicity testing and ecological assessments in water bodies and many of them complete their life cycles in a single water body so they are exposed directly to physical, chemical, and biological stressors and they also integrate the long and short term changes. When a freshwater source is degraded, the most sensitive invertebrate species are lost initially, followed by species more tolerant to pollution.These species either sustain their existence or their number decreases in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.T|first1=Barbour|title=USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, 1–35|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Macro-invertebrates are an essential part of the food chain. Their strategies for feeding can be clustered into several "functional feeding" groups. For example, shedders feed on leaves and woody materials, some depends on the vegetation growing in the water body. Examples of shredders are amphipods, isopods, freshwater crayfish, and caddisfly larvae.

==Paleoclimate proxies==
Paleoclimatology (or the study of past climates) uses proxy data in order to relate elements collected in modern-day samples to suggest the climatic conditions of the past.

===Sediment cores===
Sediment cores are one of the primary tools for studying paleolimnology because of the role in which lake and river sediments play in preserving biological information.&lt;ref name="sediment book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birks|first1=H. John. B.|last2=Lotter|first2=Andre F.|last3=Juggins|first3=Steve|last4=Smol|first4=John P.|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolimnologists collect [[Core sample|sediment cores]] and observe various proxy indicators in order to reconstruct past limnology of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Some of these indicators include geochemical markers and isotopic data which are found within the various sections of the sediment core.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; In order to calibrate data, a group of around 40 or more calibration lakes are used to reconstruct what the conditions of a new core are likely to reflect.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; The use of these calibration lakes is necessary to identify dramatic differences in a newly collected core compared to normal variations which would be depicted in the calibration lakes. Through the use of sediment cores as a technique, paleolimnologists are able to use other proxies (such as pollen, charcoal, diatoms, chironomids, and other organic matter) in order to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Lake sediment cores in particular offer a more comprehensive analysis of an area because of the continual accumulation of sediment as well as other organic matter like pollen and charcoal.

===Pollen records===
Pollen and spores can be analyzed within a lab setting to determine the family, genus, or species which the pollen grains belong. The overall taxonomic assemblage of pollen types reflects the surrounding vegetation of the lake.  [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] is a major field in [[paleoecology]]. A range of statistical and qualitative treatment of pollen records can be used to reconstruct past vegetation and climate.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt;

=== Diatoms ===
The taxonomic assemblages of [[diatom]]s reflect many aspects of the lake temperature, chemical, and nutrient environment.

=== Organic matter characteristics ===
Organic matter may be characterized in terms of 1) amount (accumulation rate, reflecting productivity), 2) origin (aquatic or terrestrial determined from the C:N ratio), 3) carbon isotopic composition (reflecting plant photosynthetic pathways of C3 vs C4 plants, and reflecting drought and/or aquatic productivity), 4) nitrogen isotopic composition (reflecting sources of nitrogen and nitrogen cycling). There are a range of biomarkers widely used, as well as compound-specific isotopic analyses.  [[Diagenesis]] is an important factor to consider in interpreting organic matter records.

===Chironomids===

==== [[Chironomids]] as a proxy of climate change: Paleolimnology and chironomids ====
One of the major factor that affects the flora and fauna of the earth is the change of climate at the local, regional and global scale. These changes are preserved over the period of time as a fossil record and through paleolimnological methods, these changes can be traced out and also helpful for the prediction of the future climate change. Chironomids are one of the best indicators of climate change. These are two winged flies and belongs to family Chironomidae with 500 to 15,000 species. Ecologically they are considered as [[Bottom feeder|bottom dwellers]] and are very responsive to any fluctuation in the surrounding environment. They are considered as a good indicator of [[salinity]], water depth, [[stream flow]], aquatic productivity, oxygen level, lake acidification, [[pollution]], [[Temperature|temperatur]]e, and overall [[ecosystem health]]. As the assemblage of chironomids is dependent on several [[environmental factor]]s, they can be easily related to those changing factors using a transfer function to connect a particular group of organisms to a specific [[environmental variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilyashuk|first1=Elena A.|last2=Ilyashuk|first2=Boris P.|last3=Tylmann|first3=Wojciech|last4=Koinig|first4=Karin A.|last5=Psenner|first5=Roland|title=Biodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high-altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|date=1 November 2015|volume=8|issue=6|pages=547–561|doi=10.1111/icad.12137|language=en|issn=1752-4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake deposits have a rich diversity of fossilized insects that trace back to middle Paleozoic era and more abundance can be found in the Quaternary period.Among aquatic invertebrates, different families of aquatic fly larvae can be traced out in the lake sediments of Quaternary era. Among them, Chironomids are of greatest ecological importance due to their diverse habitat in the aquatic ecosystem, feeding habitat, important component in the food web and above all their usage as a plaeolimnological studies because their head capsule and feeding structures are fossilized in the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew S.|title=Paleolimnology : the history and evolution of lake systems|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195133530|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chironomids complete their larval stage in the water and its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] continues up to several years while adult life span is very short. They have an important role in the degradation of material in the aquatic ecosystem and serve as an important part of the food web during their whole life cycle.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smol|first1=edited by Reinhard Pienitz and Marianne S.V. Douglas and John P.|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-2126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate change ====
According to [[IPCC]] (2007) reports one of the vital aspect of environment is the continuous climate change due several factors over the period of time which is influential in shaping the biodiversity.
Macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids have been considered as an important [[Indicator organism|indicator]] of the [[climate change]] especially temperature due to their presence in the abundance in the [[lake sediment]] as a fossil. There is a strong correlation between the chironomids assemblage and the water temperature, lake depth, salinity and, nutrients of the lake.Lake water levels over the past time period can be inferred from the chironomids assemblage due to their correlation.It is due to the fact that climate change resulted in the water level change of the lake that is related to change in the pattern of chironomids distribution and abundance.Their strong correlation helps to build the information about the evaporation and precipitation in the past. Past climate change is reconstructed based on the paleolimnology with the help of different [[fossilized]] records especially the lake sediments that helps to find out the regional and local climate change. It is important to differentiate between the impacts that a lake store due to the regional and local level [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; 

Recent studies in [[Arctic]] shows that [[biodiversity]] affect more due to the arctic warming than other associated factors like human alteration and [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RAHEL|first1=FRANK J.|last2=OLDEN|first2=JULIAN D.|title=Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=June 2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Himalayan region water bodies are not only affected by the anthropogenic disturbances but also impacted by the different types of pollutants that are transferred to this area over a longer distance.It is vital to understand all the associated factors acting on the aquatic biodiversity while analyzing the impact of climate change over the past years with the help of lake sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=C.M|last2=Sharma|first2=S|last3=Gurung|first3=S|last4=Bajracharya|first4=R.M|last5=Jüttner|first5=I|last6=Pradhan|first6=N.S|title=Global Climatic Change and High Altitude Lakes: Impacts on Aquatic Biodiversity and Pollution Status|journal=Natural Resources Management: Reviews and Research in the Himalayan Watersheds|date=2009|issue=44(977)|pages=103–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to consider that the impact and intensity of different changes due to climate change may have totally different affect on different [[ecosystems]] depending upon its sensitivity to that change &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beniston|first1=Martin|title=Climatic Change in Mountain Regions: A Review of Possible Impacts | journal=Climatic Change|date=2003|volume=59|issue=1/2|pages=5–31|doi=10.1023/A:1024458411589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors influencing chironomids distribution and abundance ====
There are several factors that has been affecting the abundance and distribution pattern of [[Chironomids]] over the past years.Therefore, it is important to be careful while making interpretations from their fossil records.There are several debates for the last many years on the impact of temperature on their abundance and diversity along with other associated factors. For the correct interpretation of the [[Fossil|fossil records]], it is important to understand all the associated factors of an ecosystem.In order to understand the different forces that have been affecting the [[fossil]] data of lake, it important to reconstruct [[Physical property|physical]], chemical and the [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient]] content of the lakes that actually shapes the communities.
Their distribution and abundance is highly influenced by the combination of human disturbance and change in the climate. Both of them influence the catchment area that resulted into the changing of [[Aquatic vegetation|vegetation]], [[hydrology]], and nutrients cycle. Any change at the regional level especially the temperature affects the water quality at the local scale and then at the end it affect the [[habitat]] that is species-specific.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

==== Chironomids and reconstruction of quantitative change in [[Holocene Epoch|Holocene climate]] ====
There is ongoing debate about the main factor that controls the distribution and abundance of chironomids.Several factors are considered as the controlling factor especially temperature that in turn control other supporting factors including Ph, [[salinity]], nutrient flow and productivity especially in the late [[Pleistocene]]/Holocene timer period. For many years research has been carried out on the relationship between temperature and chironomids distribution pattern due to its influence on its emergence. Chironomids are directly and indirectly affected by [[temperature]] during the whole life cycle including their larval emergence, growth, feeding and [[Insect reproduction|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; According to Eggermont and Heiri (2012) there is indirect impact of temperature on different physic chemical aspects of water resulted into determination of their distribution and abundance. There is also a strong relationship between the chironomids abundance, [[emergence]] and distribution with the mean temperature of the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=Hilde|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|title=The chironomid-temperature relationship: expression in nature and palaeoenvironmental implications|journal=Biological Reviews|date=May 2012|volume=87|issue=2|pages=430–456|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00206.x|pmid=22032243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research conducted by Gunten et al., 2007 at [[Lakes in Switzerland|high altitude lake]] Lej da la Tscheppain Switzerland, seasonal temperature reconstruction can be done with the help of independent chironomids and diatoms.Any change in the assemblage of chironomids reflects change in the temperature and duration of ice cover of that specific water body due to climate change. According to their findings, chironomids respond mostly to the change in the [[Temperature|summer temperature]], so seasonal variation in temperature can be inferred from different cores of the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Gunten|first1=Lucien|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|last3=Bigler|first3=Christian|last4=van Leeuwen|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Casty|first5=Carlo|last6=Lotter|first6=Andr?

[[File:Silver-McLean teaching-methodology.png|thumb]]
'''Pete Silver &amp; Will McLean''' are two British architectural practitioners, educators, writers, and technical theorists who work together as a duo. They have taught at the [[Architectural Association]], [[The Bartlett]] ([[University College London]]), and The [[University of Westminster]]'s School of Architecture and the Built environment, thus gaining a privileged position in the contemporary London architectural scene.

==Background==
Will McLean is a Doctor of Philosophy and artist [[Bruce McLean]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McLean has been engaging with architecture for over twenty years through an ongoing collaboration with [[Will Alsop]] on such buildings as the proposed 151 City Road, London: http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=866&lt;/ref&gt;'s son. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under [[Will Alsop]] OBE RA and Professor [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]]. McLean has worked on a series of projects with Bruce McLean, most notably Dalry Primary School in North Ayrshire completed in 2007 (www.primaryspace.net), and with US architect and artist Adam Kalkin,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureandhygiene.com (free download)&lt;/ref&gt; working on such projects as 'Quik Build' container housing. He has had a regular feature, covering technical innovations, in Architectural Design magazine - McLean's Nuggets, and is an Editor of Construction History - the International Journal of the Construction History Society[[File:Dalry.jpg|thumb|Dalry Primary School]]
Pete Silver worked for Solon [[Housing Association]] in South London with architects such as [[Patrick Keiller]], [[Edward Cullinan]] and [[Walter Segal]]. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under Professors [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]] and [[Gordon Pask]], and became a researcher in the Land Use Research Unit at [[King's College London]], gaining a unique insight into Professor [[Alice Coleman]]'s groundbreaking, if controversial work, on post-war housing [[urban regeneration|regeneration]]. Silver is a director of the Chartered Practice Architects (CPA) Ltd. His current work involves prototyping new structural (diagrid) frameworks from torsional elastic helixes.

==Collaborative career==
In 2001, Silver and McLean joined the School of Architecture and the Built environment at the [[University of Westminster]] where they jointly head the Technical Studies Department.&lt;!-- TEACHING ETHOS. --&gt; 
They have co-authored four architecture books: ''Fabrication: the designer's guide'' (Architectural Press), ''Introduction to Architectural Technology'' (Laurence King Publishing - available in 7 languages), ''Structural Engineering for Architects: A Handbook'' (Laurence King Publishing, co-authored with engineer Peter Evans - available in 4 languages) and Air Structures (Laurence King Publishing).
They co-curate a highly successful public lecture series,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12978">In [[computational biology]], '''power graph analysis''' is a method for the analysis and
representation of [[complex network]]s.  Power graph analysis is the computation, analysis and visual representation of a power graph from a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ([[network (mathematics)|networks]]).

Power graph analysis can be thought of as a [[Lossless data compression|lossless compression algorithm]] for graphs.&lt;ref name="Reimann2015"/&gt; It extends graph syntax with representations of [[Clique (graph theory)|cliques]], [[Complete bipartite graph|bicliques]] and [[star graph|stars]]. Compression levels of up to 95% have been obtained for complex [[biological network]]s.

[[Hypergraph]]s are a generalization of graphs in which [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s are not just couples of [[node (graph theory)|node]]s but arbitrary [[n-tuple]]s. Power graphs are not another generalization of graphs, but instead a novel representation of graphs that proposes a shift from the "node and edge" language to one using cliques, bicliques and stars as primitives.

==Power graphs==
[[Image:PowerGraphs.png|thumb|The primitive motifs used for power graph analysis and their corresponding diagrammatic representation: biclique, clique and star.]]

===Graphical representation===
Graphs are drawn with circles or points that represent '''nodes''' and lines connecting pairs of nodes that represent '''edges'''. Power graphs extend the syntax of graphs with '''power nodes''', which are drawn as a circle enclosing nodes or ''other power nodes'', and '''power edges''', which are lines between power nodes.

[[Complete bipartite graph|Bicliques]] are two sets of nodes with an edge between every member of one set and every member of the other set. In a power graph, a biclique is represented as an edge between two power nodes.

[[Clique (graph theory)|Cliques]] are a set of nodes with an edge between every pair of nodes. In a power graph, a clique is represented by a power node with a [[Loop (graph theory)|loop]].

[[Star (graph theory)|Star]]s are a set of nodes with an edge between every member of that set and a single node outside the set. In a power graph, a star is represented by a power edge between a regular node and a power node.

===Formal definition===
Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G = \bigl({V,E}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; V = \bigl\{v_0, \dots , v_n\bigr\} &lt;/math&gt; is the set of nodes and &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq V \times V&lt;/math&gt; is the set of edges, a '''power graph''' &lt;math&gt;G' = \bigl({V',E'}\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; is a graph defined on the power set &lt;math&gt;V' \subseteq \mathcal{P} \bigl(V\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; of '''power nodes''' connected to each other by '''power edges''': &lt;math&gt;E' \subseteq V'\times V'&lt;/math&gt;. Hence power graphs are defined on the [[power set]] of nodes as well as on the [[power set]] of edges of the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The semantics of power graphs are as follows: if two power nodes are connected by a power edge, this means that all nodes of the first power node are connected to all nodes of the second power node. Similarly, if a power node is connected to itself by a power edge, this signifies that all nodes in the power node are connected to each other by edges.

The following two conditions are required:
* Power node hierarchy condition: Any two power nodes are either disjoint, or one is included in the other.
* Power edge disjointness condition: There is an [[Surjective function|onto mapping]] from edges of the original graph to power edges.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Analogy to Fourier analysis==
The [[Fourier analysis]] of a function
can be seen as a rewriting of the function in terms of harmonic functions instead of
&lt;math&gt;t \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; pairs. This transformation changes the point of view from '''time domain'''
to '''frequency domain''' and enables many interesting applications in [[signal analysis]], [[data compression]], 
and filtering.
Similarly, Power Graph Analysis is a rewriting or decomposition of a network using bicliques, cliques and stars
as primitive elements (just as harmonic functions for Fourier analysis). 
It can be used to analyze, compress and filter networks.
There are, however, several key differences. First, in Fourier analysis the two spaces (time and frequency domains)
are the same function space - but stricto sensu, power graphs are not graphs.
Second, there is not a unique power graph representing a given graph. Yet a very interesting class of power graphs 
are '''minimal power graphs''' which have the least number of power edges and power nodes necessary to represent a given graph.

==Minimal power graphs==
[[Image:PowerGraphNonUnicity.png|thumb|right|200px|Two different power graphs that represent the same graph.]]
In general, there is no unique minimal power graph for a given graph.
In this example (right) a graph of four nodes and five edges admits two minimal power graphs of two power edges each.
The main difference between these two minimal power graphs is the higher nesting level of the second power graph as well as a loss of symmetry with respect to the underlying graph.
Loss of symmetry is only a problem in small toy examples since complex networks rarely exhibit such symmetries in the first place.
Additionally, one can minimize the nesting level but even then, there is in general not a unique minimal power graph of minimal nesting level.

==Power graph greedy algorithm==
The power graph greedy algorithm relies on two simple steps to perform the decomposition:

The '''first step''' identifies candidate power nodes through a [[hierarchical clustering]] of the nodes in the network 
based on the similarity of their neighboring nodes. The similarity of two sets of neighbors is taken as the [[Jaccard index]] 
of the two sets.

The '''second step''' performs a greedy search for possible power edges between candidate power nodes.
Power edges abstracting the most edges in the original network are added first to the power graph. 
Thus bicliques, cliques and stars are incrementally replaced with power edges, until all remaining single edges are also added.
Candidate power nodes that are not the end point of any power edge are ignored.

==Modular decomposition==
[[Modular decomposition]] can be used to compute a power graph by using 
the strong modules of the modular decomposition.
Modules in modular decomposition are groups of nodes in a graph that
have identical neighbors. A Strong Module is a module that does not overlap 
with another module. 
However, in [[complex networks]] strong modules are more the exception than the 
rule. Therefore, the power graphs obtained through modular decomposition are far 
from minimality.
The main difference between modular decomposition and power graph analysis is the 
emphasis of power graph analysis in decomposing graphs not only using modules of nodes 
but also modules of edges (cliques, bicliques). Indeed, power graph analysis can be seen as a loss-less 
simultaneous clustering of both nodes and edges.

==Applications==

===Biological networks===
Power Graph Analysis has been shown to be useful for the analysis of several types of biological networks such as [[Protein-protein interaction]] networks,&lt;ref name="powergraphs"/&gt; domain-peptide binding motifs, [[Gene regulatory networks]]&lt;ref name="mir-124"/&gt; and Homology/Paralogy networks. 
Also a network of significant disease-trait pairs&lt;ref name="Li2014"/&gt; have been recently visualized and analyzed with Power Graphs.

Network compression, a new measure derived from Power Graphs, has been proposed as a quality measure for protein interaction networks.&lt;ref name="net_comp"/&gt;

===Drug repositioning===
Power Graphs have been also applied to the analysis of drug-target-disease networks&lt;ref name="inc_bicliques"/&gt; for [[Drug repositioning]].

===Social networks===
Power Graphs have been applied to large-scale data in social networks, for community mining&lt;ref name="lsds"/&gt; or for modeling author types.&lt;ref name="lncs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15007">'''Reliability, availability and serviceability''' ('''RAS''') is a [[computer hardware]] engineering term involving [[reliability engineering]], [[high availability]], and [[serviceability (computer)|serviceability]] design. The phrase was originally used by International Business Machines  ([[IBM]]) as a term to describe the robustness of their [[mainframe computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reliable computer systems: design and evaluation|author=Daniel P. Siewiorek, [[Robert S. Swarz]]|year=1998|page=508}}. "The acronym RAS (reliability, accessibility and serviceability) came into widespread acceptance at IBM as the replacement for the subset notion of recovery management."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Data processor, Issues 13-17|author=Data Processing Division, International Business Machines Corp., 1970|year=1970}}- "The dependability [...] experienced by other System/370 users is the result of a strategy based on RAS (Reliability-Availability-Serviceability)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers designed with higher levels of RAS have many features that protect data integrity and help them stay [[availability|available]] for long periods of time without [[Fault (technology)|failure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.uaa.alaska.edu/~ssiewert/archive/IBM-Out-of-print/big-iron-2.pdf|author=Sam Siewert|title=Big iron lessons, Part 2: Reliability and availability: What's the difference?|date=Mar 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; this data integrity and  [[uptime]] is a particular selling point for mainframes and [[fault-tolerant system]]s.

==Definitions==

While RAS originated as a hardware-oriented term, [[systems thinking]] has extended the concept of reliability-availability-serviceability to systems in general, including [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

[...] The RAS system shall be a systematic union of software and hardware for the purpose of managing and monitoring all hardware and software components of the system to their individual potential.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Reliability'' can be defined as the probability that a system will produce correct outputs up to some given time ''t''.&lt;ref name="McClusky"&gt;{{cite book|author1=E.J. McClusky  |author2=S. Mitra |lastauthoramp=yes |title="Fault Tolerance" in Computer Science Handbook 2ed. ed. A.B. Tucker. CRC Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliability is enhanced by features that help to avoid, detect and repair hardware faults. A reliable system does not silently continue and deliver results that include uncorrected corrupted data. Instead, it detects and, if possible, corrects the corruption, for example: by retrying an operation for transient ([[Soft error|soft]]) or intermittent errors, or else, for uncorrectable errors, isolating the fault and reporting it to higher-level recovery mechanisms (which may [[failover]] to redundant replacement hardware, etc.), or else by halting the affected program or the entire system and reporting the corruption. Reliability can be characterized in terms of [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), with reliability = exp(-t/MTBF).&lt;ref name="McClusky" /&gt;
* ''Availability'' means the probability that a system is operational at a given time, i.e. the amount of time a device is actually operating as the percentage of total time it should be operating. High-availability systems may report availability in terms of minutes or hours of downtime per year. Availability features allow the system to stay operational even when faults do occur. A highly available system would disable the malfunctioning portion and continue operating at a reduced capacity. In contrast, a less capable system might crash and become totally nonoperational. Availability is typically given as a percentage of the time a system is expected to be available, e.g., 99.999 percent ("[[High availability#Percentage calculation|five nines]]").
* ''Serviceability'' or ''maintainability'' is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained; if the time to repair a failed system increases, then availability will decrease. Serviceability includes various methods of easily diagnosing the system when problems arise. Early detection of faults can decrease or avoid system downtime. For example, some enterprise systems can automatically call a service center (without human intervention) when the system experiences a system fault. The traditional focus has been on making the correct repairs with as little disruption to normal operations as possible.

Note the distinction between reliability and availability: reliability measures the ability of a system to function correctly, including avoiding data corruption, whereas availability measures how often the system is available for use, even though it may not be functioning correctly. For example, a server may run forever and so have ideal availability, but may be unreliable, with frequent data corruption.&lt;ref&gt;

==Failure types==
Physical faults can be temporary or permanent.

* Permanent faults lead to a continuing error and are typically due to some physical failure such as metal [[electromigration]] or dielectric breakdown.
* Temporary faults include ''transient'' and ''intermittent'' faults.
** Transient (a.k.a. ''soft'') faults lead to independent one-time errors and are not due to permanent hardware faults: examples include alpha particles flipping a memory bit, electromagnetic noise, or power-supply fluctuations.
** Intermittent faults occur due to a weak system component, e.g. circuit parameters degrading, leading to errors that are likely to recur.&lt;ref name="McClusky" /&gt;

==Failure responses==
Transient and intermittent faults can typically be handled by detection and correction by e.g., ECC codes or instruction replay (see below). Permanent faults will lead to uncorrectable errors which can be handled by replacement by duplicate hardware, e.g., processor sparing, or by the passing of the uncorrectable error to high level recovery mechanisms. A successfully corrected intermittent fault can also be reported to the [[operating system]] (OS) to provide information for [[predictive failure analysis]].

[[Fault-tolerant design]]s extended the idea by making ''RAS'' to be the defining feature of their computers for applications like [[stock market]] exchanges or [[air traffic control]], where system crashes would be catastrophic. [[Fault-tolerant computer system|Fault-tolerant computers]] (e.g., see [[Tandem Computers]] and [[Stratus Technologies]]), which tend to have duplicate components running in lock-step for reliability, have become less popular, due to their high cost. [[High-availability cluster|High availability systems]], using [[distributed computing]] techniques like [[computer cluster]]s, are often used as cheaper alternatives.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2928">[[File:Abbaye Saint-Victor de Paris en 1655.png|thumb|Abbey of St. Victor, 1655]]
The '''school of St Victor''' was the medieval [[monastic school]] at the [[Augustinian]] [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|abbey of St Victor]]. The name also refers to the '''Victorines''', the group of philosophers and mystics based at this school as part of the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haren, ''Medieval Thought'' (1985), pp. 111-114&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in the twelfth century by [[Peter Abelard]]'s tutor and subsequent opponent, the realist school master [[William of Champeaux]], and a prominent early member of their community was [[Hugh of St Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferruolo, The Origins of the University, Stanford University Press 1985, {{ISBN|0-8047-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent members were [[Achard of St. Victor]], [[Andrew of St Victor]], [[Richard of St Victor]], [[Walter of St Victor]] and [[Godfrey of St Victor]], as well as [[Thomas Gallus]].

Under the rigorous supervision of Hugh, St Victor offered a coherent and structured approach to learning through the cultivation of personal virtue rather than the requisition of knowledge for its own sake. This is exemplified in the schema for the [[liberal arts]] laid out in Hugh's ''Didascalicon'', in which he exhorts the reader to ''Omnia Disce'', or to know all. By 1160, the abbey had become a place of retreat from the schools, echoing the original act of weary retirement enacted by William of Champeaux at its founding. By the time of Godfrey, St Victor was primarily concerned with the instruction of its own canons, rather than the emphasis on the extern school operated earlier in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The end of the Victorines as a unique force came by 1173, when the reactionary Walter was appointed as prior. Walter launched a furious attack upon the intellectual culture of the school and its members with his ''Contra quatuor labyrinthos Francae'' (Against the Four Labyrinths of France), a denunciation of secular theological teaching. After this violent repudiation of Victorine pedagogical tradition the abbey was, in effect, a self-contained Augustinian priory like any other.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Swanson, ''The Twelfth Century Renaissance'' (1999), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jan van Ruusbroec]] submitted his [[Groenendael Priory]] to their Rule in 1335, from which stemmed the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] and [[Thomas à Kempis]]' [[Devotio Moderna]]. A major theme of their studies was the anagogical relationship between the Divine and the Mundane, adopted by Pope Eugene IV in his 5.1.1435 bull&lt;ref&gt;Belgian National Archives, Anderlecht, Fonds Ecclesiastique&lt;/ref&gt; declaring Roman supremacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2476">In [[pharmaceutics]], sink condition is a term mostly related to the [[dissolution testing]] procedure.

It means using a sheer volume of [[solvent]], usually about 5 to 10 times greater than the volume present in the [[saturated solution]] of the targeted chemical (often the [[Active pharmaceutical ingredient|API]], and sometimes the [[excipients]]) contained in the [[dosage form]] being tested.&lt;ref name="Shear Rate &amp; Sink Conditions LabHut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shear Rate &amp; Sink Conditions|url=http://www.labhut.com/education-centre/about-dissolution-testing/shear-rate-sink-conditions.html|website=LabHut|publisher=SMI-LabHut Ltd|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social determinism''' is the theory that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behavior (as opposed to biological or objective factors).

Consider certain [[human behavior]]s, such as committing murder, or writing poetry.  A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be [[Social construction|socially constructed]].

== Social determinism and ideology ==
The socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an [[ideology]] within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] are predetermined to adhere to the [[social rules]] imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which "have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has "significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda" (Colaguori 35).

By creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a [[hegemonic]] control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.

Social determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. "We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what ''is'' said, and how it is ''selectively presented'', is a far more powerful form of information control." (Colaguori 35).

Social determinism was first studied by [[Emile Durkheim]] (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.

== Social determinism ==
Social determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to [[biological determinism]]. Within the [[media studies]] discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.
[[Technological determinism]] is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.

The notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.

In her book ''Technoculture'' Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. {{Harv|Green|2001}} She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

According to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.

Thus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

==Arguments against social determinism==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Scientific studies have shown that [[social behavior]] is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.

Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

A '''statement of work''' ('''SoW''') is a document routinely employed in the field of [[project management]]. It defines project-specific activities, [[deliverable]]s and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. The SOW typically also includes detailed requirements and pricing, with standard regulatory and governance terms and conditions. It is often an important accompaniment to a [[master service agreement]] or [[request for proposal]] (RFP).

== Overview ==
Many formats and styles of Statement of Work document templates have been specialized for the hardware or software solutions described in the [[Request for Proposal]]. Many companies create their own customized version of SOWs that are specialized or generalized  to accommodate typical requests and proposals they receive.

Note that in many cases the Statement of Work is a binding contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Master service agreement|Master Service Agreements]] or Consultant/Training Service agreements postpone certain work-specific contractual components that are addressed in individual Statements of Work.  The Master Services Agreement serves as a master contract governing the terms over potentially multiple SOWs. Sometimes it refers to Scope of work.

* '''Purpose''': Why are we doing this project? A purpose statement attempts to answer this.
* '''Scope of Work''': This describes the work to be done and specifies the hardware and software involved.
* '''Location of Work:''' This describes where the work is to be performed, including the location of hardware and software and where people will meet to do the work.
* '''Period of Performance''': This specifies the allowable time for projects, such as start and finish time, number of hours that can be billed per week or month, where work is to be performed and anything else that relates to scheduling.
* '''Deliverables Schedule''': This part lists and describes what is due and when.
* '''Applicable Standards''':  This describes any industry specific standards that need to be adhered to in fulfilling the contract.
* '''Acceptance Criteria''': This specifies how the buyer or receiver of goods will determine if the product or service is acceptable, usually with objective criteria. See [[Acceptance testing]].
* '''Special Requirements''': This specifies any special hardware or software, specialized workforce requirements, such as degrees or certifications for personnel, travel requirements, and anything else not covered in the contract specifics.
* '''Type of Contract/Payment Schedule''': The project acceptance will depend on if the budget available will be enough to cover the work required. Therefore, a breakdown of payments by whether they are up-front or phased will usually be negotiated in an early stage.
* '''Miscellaneous''': Many items that are not part of the main negotiations may be listed because they are important to the project, and overlooking or forgetting them could pose problems for the project.

==United States government contracts==
For US government service contracts, the use of SOWs remains strong, although [[Statement of objectives|Statements of Objectives]] (SOOs) and [[Performance work statement|Performance Work Statements]] (PWSs) have become increasingly popular due to their emphasis on performance-based concepts such as desired service outcomes and performance standards.  SOWs are typically used when the task is well-known and can be described in specific terms.  They may be preferred when the government does not desire innovative approaches or considers any deviation in contractor processes a risk.   SOOs establish high-level outcomes and objectives for performance and PWSs emphasize outcomes, desired results, and objectives at a more detailed and measurable level, whereas SOWs provide explicit statements of work direction for the contractor or offeror to follow.

SOWs are typically replete with "contractor shall" statements of mandatory compliance (for example, "This task shall be performed in accordance with Agency xyz Directive, dated mm/dd/yyyy"). In practice, SOWs can also be found to contain references to desired performance outcomes, performance standards, and metrics, thus blurring their distinction between SOOs and PWSs. Aside from good practice, there is little government policy guidance that emphatically prescribes how and when to use SOWs versus SOOs or PWSs.  Whereas the FAR defines PWS in Part 2 Definitions, and references SOOs and PWSs in Part 37.6 Performance Based Acquisition, SOWs are not addressed.

SOWs are usually contained in the government's solicitation (RFP or RFQ) and carried forward, as may be negotiated with the offeror, into the final contract.  In federal solicitations and contracts, SOWs are inserted into Section C "Descriptions/Specifications" of the Uniform Contract Format,&lt;ref&gt;See Uniform Contract Format, FAR 14.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=38087

| title = Uniform Contract Format 
| publisher = dau.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but may also be inserted as an attachment in Section J.  In task orders, the SOW may simply be included among the terms and conditions of the order itself.  The SOW is often supplemented by technical reference documents and attachments.  In developing the SOW, it is important to ensure that the statement of work is comprehensive and sufficiently detailed, but that the statements do not duplicate terms and conditions or other provisions elsewhere in the solicitation or contract.

Guidance in MIL-STD-881 and MIL-HDBK-245 says that a [[Work Breakdown Structure]] should be used in developing the SOW.  This may use the WBS as an outline, where each WBS element (in the same name and numbering) are the sub-parts of the SOW section 3, making the development easier and to improve later billing and tracking.  The WBS which focuses on intelligently dividing a hierarchy of the work elements and defining them may then have the SOW in matching sections focus on describing what will be done with that portion or how that portion will be done.

The Statement of Work should be directly linked to deliverables shown in the [[CDRL]] form.  This is done by having each CDRL entry include reference to the SOW paragraph(s) that produces or uses the item, and the SOW text should be clear where it is discussing a deliverable by using the title or parenthesizing the item number (for example, "[A-001]").

'''''The Probability Broach''''' is a 1979 novel by American [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Neil Smith]]. It is set in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]], the so-called [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatin]] Universe, where a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] society has formed on the [[North American]] continent, styled the [[North American Confederacy]] (''NAC''). This history was created when the [[Declaration of Independence]] has the word ''unanimous'' added to the preamble, to read that governments "derive their just power from the ''unanimous'' [[consent of the governed]]".

==Plot summary==
Edward William "Win" Bear is a [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] who works for the [[Denver Police Department]] in a version of the [[United States]] in an alternate history of 1987 to be controlled by an anti-business, [[ecofascism|ecofascist]] faction complete with a new police force created in 1984 called the Federal Security Police (FSP, or "SecPol" as it is more commonly known) reminiscent of the [[Gestapo]]. [[Henry M. Jackson]] is [[President of the United States|president]], citizens' freedoms are very limited, and many laws and regulations have been passed. Examples include [[hoarding]] precious metals, such as silver and gold, is illegal and due to strict [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control policies]], only the police and citizens with federal permits are allowed to carry guns.

Bear is called to investigate the unusual murder of physicist Vaughn Meiss; he eventually finds himself projected into the [[North American Confederacy]] by means of the "Probability Broach", an inter-dimensional conduit originally developed as a means for [[interstellar travel]] in the North American Confederacy by a [[bottlenose dolphin]] physicist, named Ooloorie Eckickeck P'Wheet, and her human compatriot, Dr. Dora Jayne Thorens.

Win encounters his NAC counterpart, Edward William "Ed" Bear, and Ed's neighbors, most notably the "healer" Clarissa Olson and Lucy Kropotkin, who is later revealed to be 135 years old. Lucy's life becomes the vantage point by which Win is acclimated to life in the NAC and Laporte, the NAC equivalent to Denver. Win and Ed unravel the mystery of the Meiss murder and learn that he was killed to hide an effort by SecPol to conquer the NAC with the help of [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] forces on the NAC side, led by John Jay Madison, a.k.a. the infamous [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expatriate and 1918 war hero [[Manfred von Richthofen]], known here as the Red Knight of Prussia. Win, Ed, Lucy and Clarissa lead the effort to notify the nascent NAC government of the threat. En route to the meeting of the [[Continental Congress]], Ed and Clarissa are kidnapped, leaving Win and Lucy to reveal the plot.

After fighting (and winning) a duel with a SecPol agent, Win and Lucy rescue their friends and track Madison and the Hamiltonians to a small town outside Laporte. Win sets off an explosion that eliminates all of the Hamiltonians.

Win elects to remain in the NAC and marries Clarissa. Ed marries Lucy, who at the time of the story is awaiting a delayed "regeneration" because of an accident involving massive radiation exposure, and they then set out for the asteroid belt to build a new life for themselves on the NAC frontier.

The Continental Congress agrees to begin a massive propaganda campaign to force Win's United States (and the rest of the globe) toward a similar [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatinist]] revolution.

==Awards==
''The Probability Broach'' won the 1982 [[Prometheus Award]], which L. Neil Smith himself had created, and which is awarded by the Libertarian Futurist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfs.org/awards.htm Prometheus Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in journalism''' are individuals who participate in [[journalism]]. As journalism became a [[professionalization|profession]], women were restricted by custom from access to journalism occupations, and faced significant discrimination within the profession.  Nevertheless, women operated as editors, reporters, sports analysts and journalists even before the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Brown, "The Emergence of Females as Professional Journalists," HistoryReference.org [http://www.historyreference.org/library/refwomen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currently==

In 2017, with the [[#MeToo]] movement, a number of notable female journalists came forward to report sexual harassment in their workplaces.&lt;ref name="2017-December-Vox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/18/16780424/women-journalism-career-harassment|title=When harassment drives women out of journalism|date=December 18, 2017|website= [[Vox Media|Vox]]|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lauren Wolfe, an investigative journalist and the director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege program, female journalists face particular risks over their male colleagues, and are more likely to experience [[online harassment]] or [[sexual assault]] on the job.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"/&gt;

According to a report released on December 20, 2017 by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], in 2017, 42 journalists were killed because of their work worldwide, with 81 percent of those journalists male. This was slightly lower than the historical average of 93 percent of men journalists killed annually for their work, with ''[[The Intercept]]'' theorizing that the drop was perhaps due to women being assigned more frequently to dangerous locales.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/an-unusually-deadly-year-for-women-journalists-around-the-world-report-finds/|title=An Unusually Deadly Year for Women Journalists Around the World, Report Finds |date=December 20, 2017|website= [[The Intercept]]|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the  form  of  a  targeted  sexual  violation,  often  in  reprisal  for  their  work;  mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===
Women journalists, whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]] and even murder. They are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017. Silenced Zones: Highly Dangerous Areas for the Exercise of Freedomof Expression. Office for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly a thousand journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation|International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women’s Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2017 report of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] outlines a way forward for a gender-sensitive approach to strengthening the safety of women journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2017. The safety of journalists and the issue of impunity: Report of the Secretary-General. Available at https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N17/245/44/PDF/N1724544.pdf?OpenElement.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of Europe]]’s Committee of Ministers adopted recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in particular noting the gender-specific threats that many journalists face and calling for urgent, resolute and systematic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

[[File:Online harassment of women journalists.png|thumb|Online harassment of women journalists, UNESCO's ''World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development 2018''.]]

=== Online harassment ===
Research undertaken by [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the [[United States]] had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014. Online Harassment. Pew Research Center. Available at http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/onlineharassment/.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014. Demos: male celebrities receive more abuse on Twitter than women. Demos. Available at https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/demos-malecelebrities-receive-more-abuse-on-twitterthan-women-2/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4 million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior. Of the 10 staff journalists who received the highest levels of abuse and ‘dismissive [[Internet troll|trolling]]’, eight were women.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Becky, Mahana Mansfield, Ian Anderson, Josh Holder, Daan Louter, and Monica Ulmanu. 2016.

===Canada===
[[Sophia Dalton]] published the newspaper ''The Patriot'' in [[Toronto]] in 1840-48,&lt;ref&gt;I. R.

Canadian born [[Florence MacLeod Harper]] was notable for her work with photographer Donald Thompson covering both the Eastern front in World War One and the February revolution in St Petersburg 1917 for Leslie's weekly. Her subsequent books, Bloostained Russia and 'Runaway Russia', were some of the first Western accounts of events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexanderpalace.org/thompson/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark, women became editors early on by inheriting papers form their spouses, the earliest examples being [[Sophie Morsing]], who inherited ''Wochenliche Zeitung'' from her husband in 1658 and managed the paper as editor, and Catherine Hake, who inherited the paper ''Europäische Wochentliche Zeitung'' as widow the following year – as far as it is known, though, these women did not write in their papers.&lt;ref&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen: Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman in Denmark who published articles in Danish papers were the writer [[Charlotte Baden]], who occasionally participated in the weekly ''MorgenPost'' from 1786 to 1793.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen:Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1845, Marie Arnesen became the first woman to participate in the public political debate in a Danish newspaper, and from the 1850s, it became common for women to participate in public debate or contribute with an occasional article: among them being [[Caroline Testman]], who wrote travel articles, and [[Athalia Schwartz]], who was a well known public media figure through her participation in the debate in the papers between 1849 and 1871.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1870s, the women's movement started and published papers of their own, with women editors and journalists.

It was not until the 1880s, however, that women begun to be professionally active in the Danish press, and [[Sofie Horten]] (1848–1927) likely became the first woman who supported herself as a professional journalist when she was employed at ''Sorø Amtstidende'' in 1888.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An important pioneer was [[Loulou Lassen]], employed at the ''[[Politiken]]'' in 1910, the first female career journalist and a pioneer female journalist within science, also arguably the first nationally well known woman in the profession. In 1912, eight women were members of the reporter's union ''[[Københavns Journalistforbund]]'' (Copenhagen Association of Journalists), five in the club ''Journalistforeningen i København'' (Journalist Association of Copenhagen) and a total of 35 women employed as journalists in Denmark.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Finland===

The Swedish journalist and editor [[Catharina Ahlgren]] was most likely the first female journalist and editor in the then Swedish province of Finland when she published her own essay paper, the Swedish language ''Om att rätt behaga'' in 1782, which was also among the very first papers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write – women in Finnish media 1771–1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the first female journalist has been referred to as [[Fredrika Runeberg]], who wrote poems and articles in ''[[Helsingfors Morgonblad]]'' under the name of her spouse [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first woman in Finland to work as a journalist in Finland under her own name was [[Adelaïde Ehrnrooth]], who wrote in ''[[Helsingfors Dagblad]]'' and ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'' for 35 years from 1869 onward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===France===
[[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] (1663–1719) has been referred to as one of the most famous early 18th century female journalists in Europe. Her reports of the negotiations leading to the [[Peace of Utrecht]] were read all over Europe and admired for the distinction with which she reported on scandal and gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Regine Reynolds-Cornell: Fiction and reality in the Mémoires of the notorious Anne-Marguerite Petit DuNoyer (Tübingen: Narr 1999). {{ISBN|3-8233-5527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The first female journalist in Norway was [[Birgithe Kühle]], who published the local paper ''Provincial-Lecture'' in [[Bergen]] between 1794 and 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Bra böckers världshistoria / [chefredaktör: Kenneth Åström ; redaktion: Gil Dahlström ...]. Bd 10, Två revolutioner : 1750–1815 / av Kåre Tønnesson ; [översättning: Ingrid Emond ...] Malmö Bra Böcker 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th-century, women participated with articles in the press, especially within the culture sections and a translators, notably [[Magdalene Thoresen]], who has by some been referred to as an early female journalist: from 1856, [[Marie Colban]] (1814–1884) lived in Paris, from where she wrote articles for ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' and ''[[Illustreret Nyhedsblad]]'', for which she can be regarded as the first female foreign correspondent in the Norwegian press.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other pioneers were [[Wilhelmine Gulowsen]], editor of the culture paper ''Figaro'' in 1882–83, and [[Elisabeth Schøyen]], editor of the family magazine ''Familie-Musæum'' in 1878 and journalist of ''[[Bergensposten]]'' and ''[[Aftenposten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Schøyen. (2009, 14. februar). I Store norske leksikon. Hentet 16. November 2015 fra https://snl.no/Elisabeth_Sch%C3%B8yen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian newspaper press in the capital of [[Oslo]] had their first two female reporters with [[Marie Mathisen]] in ''[[Dagsposten]]'' in 1897, and [[Anna Hvoslef]] in ''[[Aftenposten]]'' in 1898: the former became the first female member of the [[Oslo Journalistklubb]] (Oslo Journalist Association) in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaale, Reidun: Kvinner i norsk presse gjennom 150 år. Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Beata Chmielowska-Olech beax.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish television news anchor Beata Chmielowska-Olech, 2007]]
In 1822, [[Wanda Malecka]] (1800–1860) became the first woman newspaper publisher in Poland when she published the ''Bronisława'' (followed in 1826–31 by the ''Wybór romansów''); she had in 1818-20 previously been the editor of the handwritten publication ''Domownik'', and was also a pioneer woman journalist, publishing articles in ''Wanda''.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Rogalski, Historya literatury Polskiéj, Volume 2, Nakładem Michała Glücksberga, księgarza, 1871. pp. 590–591&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[File:Wendela Hebbe.jpg|thumb|[[Wendela Hebbe]], drawing by [[Maria Röhl]] 1842.]]
In Sweden, [[Maria Matras]], known as "N. Wankijfs Enka", published the paper ''Ordinarie Stockholmiske Posttijdender'' in 1690–1695, but it is unknown if she wrote in the paper as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690–1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690–1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margareta Momma]] became the first identified female journalist and [[chief editor]] as the editor of the political essaypaper ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'' in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Öhrberg, Vittra fruntimmer. Författarroll och retorik hos frihetstidens kvinnliga författare (Uppsala 2001) 165–187, 339–345.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th-century, many periodicals for, about, and likely also by women were published, but as women normally published under pseudonym, the can seldom be identified: one of the few identified ones being [[Catharina Ahlgren]], who edited the typical women's periodical ''[[De nymodiga fruntimren]]'' (Modern Women) in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Margareta, Äntligen ord från qwinnohopen!: At last, words also from the women : om kvinnopress under 1700-talet, Akademilitt., Stockholm, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Women chief editors became fairly common during the 18th-century when the press in Sweden developed, especially since the widow of a male printer or editor normally took over the business of her late spouse: a successful and well known female newspaper editor was [[Anna Hammar-Rosén]], who managed the popular newspaper ''[[Hwad Nytt?? Hwad Nytt??]]'' between 1773 and 1795.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

It was not until the 19th-century that the papers of the Swedish press started to introduce a permanent staff of co-workers and journalists, a development which attached the first women as permanent employees to the newspaper offices, which are noted to be [[Wendela Hebbe]] at ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' in 1841–51 and [[Marie Sophie Schwartz]] at ''Svenska Tidningen Dagligt Allehanda'' in 1851–57.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1858, [[Louise Flodin]] came to be regarded as an important pioneer when she founded her own newspaper, became the first woman to be given a newspaper license, and composed a staff entirely of women employees,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Eva Brag]] became an important pioneer during her career at ''Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning'' in 1865–1889.&lt;ref&gt;Heggestad, Eva: Kritik och kön. 1880-talets kvinnliga kritiker och exemplet Eva Brag. Samlaren. Tidskrift för svensk litteraturvetenskaplig forskning. Årgång 115 1994. Svenska Litteratursällskapet.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s, women became more common in the offices of the press, and when women was admitted to the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] in 1885, 14 women were inducted as members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;    
The pioneer generation of women journalists were generally from the upper class who wished to earn their own income.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At this point, the focus of a conventional education for a woman was language, which was not the case with a conventional male education, especially since the male reporters were generally not from the upper classes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women were employed as translators and given the responsibility for the coverage of culture and foreign news and interviews of foreigners. During this period, women journalists were reportedly respected – partially due to their social background – and due to their language skills given assignments with equal status to their male co-workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1918, [[Maria Cederschiöld]], first woman editor of a foreign news section, recalled that women reporters were not as controversial or discriminated in the 1880s as they would later become, "...when the results of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s hatred of women made itself known. Nor was the struggle of life and competition so sharp, as it has later become. The women pioneers were generally treated with sympathy and interest, even by the men, perhaps because they normally did not regard them as dangerous competitors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Of the seven biggest newspapers in Stockholm, six had female co-workers prior to 1900, and when [[Swedish Union of Journalists]] was founded in 1901, women were included from the start.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An important event occurred in 1910, when the popular novel ''Pennskaftet'' by [[Elin Wägner]] made the journalist profession a popular career choice for women, and women career journalists were often referred to as "pennskaft".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By this time, women reporters, though a minority, had become common and no longer regarded as a novelty and the competition had become harder: in 1913, ''[[Stockholms Dagblad]]'' made a record by having seven female co-workers, and the same year, the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] founded the ''De kvinnliga journalisternas stipendiefond'' to finance foreign trips for women reporters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women covered [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution]] and several women journalists became famed role models such as [[Ester Blenda Nordström]] and [[Elin Brandell]].

During the [[Interwar period]], a change occurred which exposed women reporters to an informal discrimination long referred to as a "woman's trap": the introduction of the customary women's section of the newspapers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; During [[World War I]], war time rationing made it necessary to cover household interests, which after the war became a woman's section, as household tasks were regarded as female tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The coverage of the women's section customarily became the task of the women reporters, and as they were a minority, the same reporters were often forced to handle the women's section side from their other assignments, which placed them in a great disadvantage to their male colleagues when the competition became harsher during the interwar depression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   
In parallel, they were women with successful careers, notably [[Barbro Alving]], whose coverage of the [[Spanish civil war]], [[World War II]] and the [[Cold war]] made her famous, and Dagmar Crohn, who were the editor of the economy section at ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' in 1933–1959, which made her unique at the time.
In 1939, [[Elsa Nyblom]] became vice chairperson of the [[Publicistklubben]].

The informal discrimination changed when women reporters started to expand the subjects treated at the women's sections. A noted example of this development was [[Synnöve Bellander]], editor of the women's section ''Hus och hem'' at Svenska Dagbladet in 1932–59. Originally expected to write only of fashion and make up, she started to expand the area to the subjects of education and professional life for women, and from there to consumer issues and food quality and other issues concerning the private home life. This development in the women's sections gradually transformed them to sections for "family" and private life for both sexes, and blurred the line to the rest of the paper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The 1960s signified a great change. A debate about gender discrimination in the press, followed by the general debate about gender roles during the 
[[second-wave feminism]], quickly raised the numbers of female reporters in the press from 1965 onward. In 1970, [[Pernilla Tunberger]] became the first woman to be awarded ''[[Stora Journalistpriset]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The first female full-time employed journalist in [[Fleet Street]] was [[Eliza Lynn Linton]], who was employed by ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' from 1848: three years later, she became the paper's correspondent in Paris, and upon her return to London in the 1860s, she was given a permanent position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as the first account of war by a woman. Her writing analyzes the relevant events, personalities of key actors and consequences of the military struggles she observed. Moreover, she was personally involved in the heart of the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. She suffered the hardships of siege when she sheltered in the cellar of [[Marshall House (Schuylerville, New York)|the Marshall House]] during the [[Saratoga campaign|failed retreat of the British army]].

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women began agitating for the right to work as professional journalists in North America and Europe; by many accounts, the first notable woman in political journalism was [[Jane Grey Swisshelm]]. A former correspondent for Horace Greeley's ''New York Tribune'', she persuaded President Millard Fillmore to open the gallery in congress so that she could report on congressional news.&lt;ref&gt;"Jane Grey Swisshelm:  A Staunch Foe of Slavery, A Noble Woman's Life's Work." San Francisco Bulletin, 2 August 1884, p. 1S.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Swisshelm, Horace Greeley had employed another noteworthy woman in journalism, [[Margaret Fuller]], who covered international news.  [[Nellie Bly]] became known for her investigative reporting at the ''New York World''. She was one of the first female journalists of her era to report by going undercover.

While many female reporters in the 1800s and early 1900s were restricted to [[society reporting]] and were expected to cover the latest in food or fashion, there were a few women who reported on subjects that were considered the domain of male reporters. One example was [[Ina Eloise Young]] (later Ina Young Kelley). In 1907, Miss Young was said to be the only female sports editor (or "sporting" editor, as it was then called). She worked in Colorado for the ''Trinidad Chronicle-News'', and her areas of expertise were baseball, football, and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;"Colorado Has the Only Woman Sporting Editor." Washington DC Sunday Star, 29 December 1907, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; She covered the 1908 World's Series, the only woman of her time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"World's Series Notes." Harrisburg (PA) Patriot, 15 October 1908, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Status of Women in the U.S. Media reported that of more than 150 sports-related print publications and sports-related websites, 90 percent of editors were white males.&lt;ref name="Bedard-WE media"/&gt;

[[File:Public Domain World War II Correspondents (NARA).jpg|thumb|350px|U.S. [[World War II]] [[War correspondent|correspondents]]]]
Another example of a woman in a non-traditional media profession was [[Jennie Irene Mix]]:  when radio broadcasting became a national obsession in the early 1920s, she was one of the few female radio editors at a magazine:  a former classical pianist and a syndicated music critic who wrote about opera and classical music in the early 1920s, Miss Mix became the radio editor at ''Radio Broadcast'' magazine, a position she held from early 1924 until her sudden death in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Mitchell, editor.

===Nepal===
The history of women in journalism in [[Nepal]] is relatively new. Nepal only enjoyed an open press after the [[People's Movement I (1990)|1990 democratic movement]]. It is only since that change that women have been more active in the scene of journalism. The number of registered women journalists under the [[Federation of Nepalese Journalists]] is 1,613.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://setopati.net/blog/15868/|title=Women in media in Nepal|work=Setopati Online|author=Bhandari, Kripa |date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Hind Nawfal]] (1860–1920) was the first woman in the Arab world to publish a journal ([[Al Fatat]]) concerning only women's issues.  [[Zaynab Fawwaz]] was another prolific journalist who also founded a literary salon.

===Turkey===
[[Fatma Aliye Topuz]] wrote for thirteen years between 1895 and 1908 columns in the magazine Hanımlara Mahsus Gazete ("Ladies' Own Gazette") and her sister [[Emine Semiye Onasya]] worked on the editorial staff.

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
While there are significant numbers of [[Women in music|women vocalists]] singing in pop and rock music, many other aspects of pop and rock music are male-dominated, including [[record producer|record producing]], [[Instrumentalist|instrument playing]] and [[music journalism]]. According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;Crawford, Anwen. "The World Needs Female Rock Critics" in ''The Atlantic''. 26 May 2015. Available at: http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour."&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock]]'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from "masculine subject positions."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Steve, ed. (2002). Pop Music and the Press. Temple University Press. ASIN B00EKYXY0K. {{ISBN|9781566399661}}. p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there are relatively few women writing in music journalism: "By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' hovered around...15%, [while] at ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]]'', [it was] roughly 20%."&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002) at 94, quoted in {{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion |chapter=Meaning Making in the Press |title=Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse, and Girl Power |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England  |year= 2007 |page=67 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd  |isbn=9780754638629 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMtDpy85IC4C&amp;pg=PA67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism associated with gender was discussed in a 2014 ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the ''[[Nashville Scene]]''.&lt;ref name=moore2014&gt;{{cite web|author=Moore, Tracy |date=20 March 2014 |title=Oh, the Unbelievable Shit You Get Writing About Music as a Woman |work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]] |url=http://jezebel.com/oh-the-unbelievable-shit-you-get-writing-about-music-a-1547444869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist, has written critiques on the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696|title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A. Times pop critic], ''Seattle Times'', 7 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Powers co-wrote the book ''[[Piece by Piece (book)|Piece by Piece]]'' with musician [[Tori Amos]], which discusses the role of women in the modern music industry, and features information about composing, touring, performance, and the realities of the music business.

Notable popular music critics include:
*[[Tanja Bakić]]
*[[Raquel Cepeda]]
*[[Ann Powers]]
*[[Joy Press]]
*[[Linda Solomon]]
*[[Lillian Roxon]]
*[[Penny Valentine]]

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
In 2005, the National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia studied arts journalism in America and found that "the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female." However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "...large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "...first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "...what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women classical music critics include:
