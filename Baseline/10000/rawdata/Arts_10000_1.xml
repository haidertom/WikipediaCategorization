"'''(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar'''" is a 2009 [[song]] created and performed by the cast of the [[web series]] ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'', with lead vocals by [[Singing|singer]]-[[actress]] [[Felicia Day]]. The lyrics were written by Day and the music was written by musical composer [[Jed Whedon]], who also directed the music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
When interviewed at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], Day attributed her inspiration for the song to 1980s and 1990s-style [[dance music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Seize the Day | date = August 7, 2009 | work = [[GameTrailers]] | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/episode/gametrailers-tv/66?ch=3&amp;sd=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She conveyed an obsession with [[Stacey Q]]'s "[[Two of Hearts (song)|Two of Hearts]]" in particular, which is apparent with Day including a familiar ''"come on, come on"'' in the lyrics. The song includes a [[Rapping|rap]] portion performed by ''Guild'' co-stars [[Jeff Lewis (actor)|Jeff Lewis]] and [[Sandeep Parikh]].

While Day composed the lyrics herself, whilst listening to "really bad 1990s dance songs", she turned to screenwriter [[Jed Whedon]] (with whom she had worked on internet musical ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog]]'' and TV series ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'') to compose the music.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | title =  Cult web series tops iTunes chart | last = Savage | first = Mark | work = [[BBC News]] | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8214023.stm | accessdate = August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whedon and his wife [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] are credited as backup singers on the video, and Tancharoen also contributes her talent as a back-up dancer; this was the first time Whedon (who also directed the video) had seen her dance.&lt;ref name=Digitalcity/&gt;

==Music video==
The music video features the entire cast of ''The Guild'' dressed up as their own online "[[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]" characters from the web series.

Day comments that "In a regular Hollywood situation it would have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars", but the video was recorded in Whedon's closet three weeks prior to its general release.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  Whedon stated that in directing the video (his first time "directing anything" according to his wife) he "basically wanted to do a relatively cliché dance video as if it were about medieval fantasy warriors who took themselves really seriously," in which respect he felt the cast delivered "perfectly and hilariously". He used [[stop motion]] techniques to compensate for those members of ''The Guild'' cast who do not have dancing skills. Then, to make it "legit" as a video, Whedon made sure to include "actual sexy footage of Felicia, stellar dancing with [[Amy Okuda|Amy [Okuda]]] showing off her chops, and of course, raining money."&lt;ref name=Digitalcity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalcity.com/2009/08/18/do-you-want-to-date-my-avatar-1-on-itunes-and-amazon/ |title='Do You Want To Date My Avatar' #1 on iTunes and Amazon |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |last=Milne |first=Carly |work=Digital City |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919185527/http://www.digitalcity.com/2009/08/18/do-you-want-to-date-my-avatar-1-on-itunes-and-amazon/ |archivedate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Lewis describes himself as "not good at anything at all - dancing or rap" and comments, "they were able to make what I did [the rap sequence] fairly entertaining". Lewis recorded four lines of rap at Jed's house which were later synced up to the video. He was told to dance or "do anything" for three minutes, which "felt really bad and embarrassing... awful" but was impressed when the footage was slowed down, and became "more than I anticipated or imagined in a music video."&lt;ref name=Digitalcity/&gt;

==Reception==
The video reached 1 million [[YouTube]] hits in less than 2 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Do You Wanna Date My Avatar’ Breaks 1M Views, #1 On iTunes, Amazon |last=Hustvedt |first=Marc |date=August 19, 2009 |work=[[Tubefilter|Tubefilter News]] |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/08/19/do-you-wanna-date-my-avatar-breaks-1m-views-1-on-itunes |accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj809"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamin |last=Brophy-Warren |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |title=How the Web Series 'The Guild' Stays Successful |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203706604574371032925896794 |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actually, I do wanna date Felicia Day's avatar |last=Bridges |first=C.

On August 6, 2010 the song became a playable track on ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' via the [[Rock Band Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/offers/8000046f-0000-4000-8000-000045410869?cid=RockBandCom&amp;partner=RockBandCom |title=Full Song - "(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar" |publisher=Marketplace.xbox.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]] entertainment reporter Mark Savage describes the song as "[r]eminiscent of [[Ace of Base]]'s '[[All That She Wants]]'" and describes the rap by Jeff Lewis and Sandeep Parikh as "intricate and clearly masterful".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

TV writer, director and producer [[Joss Whedon]] (brother of composer Jed Whedon), who has worked with Day on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog|Dr. Horrible]]'' and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'', gave his support for the song. On [[weblog]] [[Whedonesque.com]], Whedon implored his fanbase to support the video, saying "I really want this to be big. It's indie (which is the most important part), it's awesome... So help me out. Let's go the extra mile here and DESTROY THE [[Taylor Swift|SWIFTBOT]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whedonesque.com/comments/21340#334270 |title='(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar' Video Number One Video on iTunes!!!; comment by Joss |work=[[Whedonesque.com]] |date=August 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1658'''.

==Events==
*[[March 5]] – A play adapted from ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is performed by students of the Gymnasium in [[Zittau]], the earliest record of a [[Shakespearean comedy]] produced anywhere in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; authorship is attributed to [[Christian Keymann]], but remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Cohn (scholar) |title=Shakespeare in Germany in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries: An Account of English Actors in Germany and the Netherlands, and of the Plays Performed by Them during the Same Period|publisher=Asher and Co. |location=London and Berlin |year=1865 |pages=cxxiv–cxxv |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This climate inspires the [[Silesia]]n playwright [[Andreas Gryphius]]. Also this year, he prints one of the first secular [[Baroque]] works in [[German literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frantz |first=Barbara |title=The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature |editor1=Eigler, Friederike Ursula |editor2=Kord, Susanne |chapter=Baroque Literature|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1997 |page=40 |isbn=0-313-29313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the verse comedy ''Absurda Comica oder Herr Peter Squenz''. Borrowing from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (including its main character, [[Peter Quince]]), Gryphius' text rejects ''[[Meistersinger]]'' culture, while also "reinvigorating the tradition" of German-language theater after the long hiatus of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=John |title=Camden House History of German Literature.

*April – [[Blaise Pascal]] enters the creative period that will lead to his ''[[Pensées]]'', with a lecture for his [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] friends at [[Port-Royal-des-Champs Abbey]], and later with a series of scattered notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Connell |first=Marvin Richard |title=Blaise Pascal: Reasons of the Heart |publisher=William B.

*[[May 29]] – [[Dara Shukoh]], heir-apparent to the crown of the [[Mughal Empire]], is defeated by his younger brother, [[Aurangzeb]], in the [[Battle of Samugarh]]. Dara's overtures toward [[Vedanta]] and [[Sufism in India|Sufism]], including his promotion of the [[Upanishads]], are condemned, as Aurangzeb formally adheres to [[Islamic fundamentalism]] – and in practice to a less syncretic [[theism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pirbhai |first=M.

*[[July 6]] – [[Teimuraz I of Kakheti|Teimuraz]], deposed ruler of [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]] and pioneer of Georgian poetry, is received in [[Moscow]], [[Tsardom of Russia]].

*[[September 5]] – Forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Crimean Khanate]], under the command of [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]], storm into the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvanian]] capital of [[Alba Iulia|Feyérvár (Alba Iulia)]]. The city is devastated, and its role in fostering [[Renaissance humanism]] is forever ended: though restored, the Bethlen Collegium is transferred to [[Aiud|Nagyenyed (Aiud)]].

*[[September 13]] ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.

The event inspires [[Andrew Marvell]] to write "A Poem upon the Death of his Late Highness the Lord Protector"; this piece is not included in the official edition of Cromwellian panegyrics, which has verse by [[John Dryden]], [[Thomas Sprat]], and [[Edmund Waller]].

'''Anagnorisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɒr|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀναγνώρισις}}) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the [[hero]]'s sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often [[antagonist]]ic [[fictional character|character]] in [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], "Myth, Fiction, And Displacement" p 25 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tragedy==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', as part of his discussion of [[peripeteia]], Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune" (1452a). It is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[catharsis]].

[[File:Lear and Cordelia.jpg|right|thumb|"Lear and Cordelia" by [[Ford Madox Brown]]:  Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters.]]
In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of tragedy, it was the discovery of one's own identity or true character (e.g. Cordelia, Edgar, Edmund, etc. in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'') or of someone else's identity or true nature (e.g. Lear's children, Gloucester's children) by the tragic hero.  

Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis, with peripeteia caused by it. He considered it the mark of a superior tragedy, as when [[Oedipus]] killed his father and married his mother in ignorance, and later learned the truth, or when [[Iphigeneia in Tauris]] realizes in time that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, and refrains from sacrificing them.  Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when [[Medea]] resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so.

Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in [[Aeschylus]]'s "The Choephoroi" ("[[Libation Bearers]]") when [[Electra]] recognizes her brother, [[Orestes]], after he has returned to [[Argos]] from his exile, at the grave of their father, [[Agamemnon]], who had been murdered at the hands of [[Clytemnestra]], their mother. [[Electra]] convinces herself that Orestes is her brother with three pieces of evidence: a lock of Orestes's hair on the grave, his footprints next to the grave, and a piece of weaving which she embroidered herself.  The footprints and the hair are identical to her own. Electra's awareness is of her brother's presence, who is the one person who can help her by avenging the death of their father.&lt;ref&gt;
Aeschylus, and Robert Lowell. The Oresteia of Aeschylus. New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
[[File:Robson Crane Comedy of Errors.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for a performance of ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'':  When the twins, confused with each other throughout the play, recognize each other's existence, the play reaches its happy ending.]]
The section of Aristotle's ''Poetics'' dealing with comedy did not survive, but many critics also discuss recognition in comedies.  A standard plot of the [[New Comedy]] was the final revelation, by birth tokens, that the heroine was of respectable birth and so suitable for the hero to marry. This was often brought about by the machinations of the [[tricky slave]].  This plot appears in Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', where a recognition scene in the final act reveals that Perdita is a king's daughter rather than a shepherdess, and so suitable for her prince lover.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, "Recognition in ''The Winter's Tale''" p 108-9 ''Fables of Identity:  Studies in Poetic Mythology'', {{ISBN|0-15-629730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and modern usage==
===Mystery===
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a classical ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its [[twist ending]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist of the story, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
Anagnorisis, however, is not limited to classical or Elizabethan sources. Author and lecturer Ivan Pintor Iranzo points out that contemporary ''auteur'' [[M. Night Shyamalan]] uses similar revelations in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', in which child psychologist Malcolm Crowe successfully treats a child who is having visions of dead people, only to realize at the close of the film that Crowe himself is dead, as well as in ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', in which the character of David realizes that he survived a train crash that killed the other passengers, due to a supernatural power.&lt;ref name="formats"&gt;Ivan Pintor Iranzo. [http://www.upf.edu/materials/depeca/formats/arti6_ing.htm The naked and the dead. The Representation of the dead and the construction of the other in contemporary cinema: The case of M. Night Shyamalan], No. 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another well known example of anagnorisis from popular culture is the revelation that [[Darth Vader]] is the father of [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. An extensive account of the history and application of anagnorisis is provided by Terence Cave in his book ''Recognitions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Recognitions: A Study in Poetics''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A humorous definition is included in 'The Banner: mock-heroic verse epic, Part 1: Sid' by Robin Gordon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any moment of such crisis / 
one thinks, of course, of those devices / 
which Aristotle said were needed / 
in any poem.  We have heeded / 
Aristotle, and our plot, / 
(beginning, middle, end), has got / 
complications too, and error / 
fit to rouse cathartic terror, / 
protagonists, antagonists, / 
peripiteia, turns and twists. / 
The poet's comments form the choruses, / 
but now it's time for anagnorisis. / 
When Oedipus sees the bird he's bedded / 
is his own father's lawful wedded / 
wife, in fact she is his mother, / 
or Iphigenia finds her brother, / 
Discovery or Recognition / 
brings the plot to its fruition.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ancient Greek funerary vases''' are decorative grave markers made in [[ancient Greece]] that were designed to resemble liquid-holding vessels. These decorated vases were placed on grave sites as a mark of elite status. There are many types of funerary vases, such as [[amphorae]], [[krater]]s, [[oinochoe]], and [[kylix]] cups, among others. One famous example is the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. Every-day vases were often not painted, but wealthy Greeks could afford luxuriously painted ones. Funerary vases on male graves might have themes of military prowess, or athletics. However, allusions to death in [[Greek tragedies]] was a popular motif. Famous centers of vase styles include [[Corinth]], [[Lakonia]], [[Ionia]], South Italy, and [[Athens]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/classroom_resources/curricula/mythology/lesson01.html|title=A Story on a Vase (Education at the Getty)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major type of funerary vase was the krater, a mixing bowl for wine and water used by elite Greek males at [[symposium]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Symposiums were an eastern influence&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/greek-art-and-archaeology-a-new-history-c-2500-c-150-bce/oclc/1003354922&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Greek art and archaeology: a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=Neer|first=Richard T|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the aristocracy would lie down and drink; many Greek painters referenced this lifestyle in their art. The krater was so symbolic of elite status that large, richly decorated kraters would be placed upon grave sites. Although in the shape of drinking vessels, some funerary kraters were made just to be a grave marker, as indicated by a hole in the bottom of the vessel.

The display of highly decorated funeral vase markers, along with costly grave goods, and elaborate processions, helped to display the status of wealthy families. This act is called conspicuous consumption, and would let the whole community know who held power in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/greek-art-and-archaeology/oclc/795491925&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Greek art and archaeology|last=Pedley|first=John Griffiths|date=2012|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780205001330|location=New York (N.Y.)|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types ==
The [[amphora]] was a tall, slender pot that often held oil, wine, milk, or grain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These could be as tall as an adult, and were both practical for transporting goods, and artistic in their funerary usage. Amphorae filled with oil were awarded to victorious athletes during [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic games]], with the winner painted on it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These might be placed on the grave of the athlete.  

The [[Lekythos]] was another style of funerary vase that usually held ritual oil. It had a slender body with a single handle. One famous artist of lekythoi was the [[Achilles Painter|Achiles painter]]. Funeral lekythoi were often painted in the [[white ground technique]].   

The [[kylix]] (kylikes, plural), popular at symposiums, was a stout drinking cup with a very wide bowl. A well known potter of kylikes was [[Exekias]]. After being formed separately on the potter's wheel, the bowl and stem would be left to dry. The cup would then be placed upside down to attach the handles. The handles would dry in this upside down position, giving the handles a unique upturned curve when the kylix was upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/techniques-of-painted-attic-pottery/oclc/1000752404&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The techniques of painted Attic pottery.|last=Noble|first=Joseph Veach|last2=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|first2=N.Y)|date=1965|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An oinochoe was a stout wine jug with a distinct pouring lip, and a large handle. The name comes from oinos (wine), and cheo (to pour).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0004:id=oinochoe|title=Perseus Encyclopedia, Oak, Oinochoe|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have relief sculpture under the bowl. There are two other variations of oinochoe that differ in size and style, called olpe and chous.[http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/oinochoe.htm]

The [[hydria]] was a water-containing vessel with three handles; two for carrying, and another for pouring. These could also be made out of bronze. A well preserved example is the [[Regina Vasorum]] from Southern Italy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/25.+Archaeological+Artifacts/289706/?lng=|title=Art works|website=www.hermitagemuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regina Vasorum has black lacquer with gilding. Demeter, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, and Dionysus can all be seen on this hydria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Geometric patterns adorn many vases between 900-700 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/archaeology-of-greece-an-introduction/oclc/33818589&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The archaeology of Greece: an introduction|last=Biers|first=William R|date=1996|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801431735|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns include meanders, right-angles, and [[swastikas]].

Images from vases can provide information about religion, beliefs, and how people lived, including burial rites. Burial customs included washing and dressing the body in ointments before wrapping the body in a [[shroud]] and outer cloth. The body would then be laid upon a [[bier]], or funeral bed, which gives form to the Greeks' association between sleep and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/Classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200636tburial.htm|title=CU Classics {{!}} Greek Vase Exhibit {{!}} Essays {{!}} Burial Customs|website=www.colorado.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Thanatos]], the god of gentle death, can be seen on Greek funerary vases taking away the body of the deceased to the underworld. The act of laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis, is painted on the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. The next step was the ekphora; the moving of the body to a cemetery in a procession. If cremation was practiced, the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funeral vase, and buried.     [[File:Dipylon amphora close front (Prothesis).jpg|thumb|
[[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]], mid-700's B.C. detail of laying out the body (prothesis).
]]

== Social connections ==
Kylikes, used at symposiums, would often be painted with large eyes on them. When drinking from these [[Eye-cup|eye-cups]], they would act as a mask, like actors would wear in a play. These eyes would stare at the other guests, with the handles resembling ears. The Greek word for handle is "ous", meaning ear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The altered state of mind that comes from drinking alcohol is analogous to putting on the mask of someone else. This connection between wine, masks, and stories told at symposiums were all embodied in the god [[Dionysus]], the god of wine and theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;     

== Tragedy on vases ==
[[File:Exekias Suicide d Ajax 01 glare reduced white bg.png|thumb|
Exekias's vase depicting the suicide of Ajax
]]
Greek tragedies were a popular motif on funeral vases which often contained the death of someone close to the main character within the play. An example of this is the [[suicide of Ajax vase]]. Greeks would see these pictures of Greek tragedies on vases, which would remind them of the suffering that heroes of old had to endure. They believed that If great heroes were able to survive life's sufferings, then so could they.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this way, they could view tragedy as something comforting, thus giving people the strength to persevere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/0892368071.html|title=Pots &amp; plays: interactions between tragedy and Greek vase-painting of the fourth century B.C.|last=Taplin|first=Oliver|date=2007|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through visual depictions of tragedies, the Greeks could relate to the deceased. Pots that depict funerary scenes were usually designed for tombs. However, vases with comical motifs have also been found in graves.

'''''Apocalyptic Rider''''' is a [[painting]] created by [[Nabil Kanso]] in [[1980 in art|1980]]. It is [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]] measuring 7 X 9 feet (2 X 2.65 meters),&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso:The Split of Life: Paintings 1974-94'', p.56, NEV Editions, Atlanta 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of a [[Serial imagery|series]] depicting horsemen in [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s dealing with [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: ''The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', Instituto Nacional de Cultura, [[Panama]], 1988; [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], pp.2-3, April 26, 1987, Caracas, online [http://apocalypsepainting.com/erminy.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.org/contramaestre.html Contramaestre, Carlos,  ''Nabil Kanso Mouth of the Apocalypse'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a scene in which a horseman appears riding forward between two horizontally juxtaposed horses. The "Rider," symbolically representing [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman]] of the [[Apocalypse]], is shown moving toward a figure falling near a mother holding a child. The [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the picture is focused on the image formed by the rider and horses in the central plane. Its area, which occupies much of the pictorial space, appears to links the background and foreground, and to reinforce the tense atmosphere generated by the subject matter and the rendering of dense layers of paint applied with broad brushstrokes across the entire surface. The tone reflects a contrast of blue black against red.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apocalypsepainting.com/panorama85.html ''Expressions'', Panorama, April 17, 1985, Maracaibo]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some art critics interpreted the work as a [[metaphor]] for the wars in [[Central America]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, I, ''Nabil Kanso: Expressions'', Panorama, April 15, 1985, Maracaibo, [http://apocalypsepainting.com/panorama85.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others suggest that the compositional conception of the figures, colors, symbols and textures give a sense of imminent threat underlining the depicted [[Theme (arts)|theme]].&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, ''The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], pp.2-3, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art in Paris '''is an article on the '''[[art]] '''culture and history in''' [[Paris]]''', the capital of [[France]]. For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, arriving in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Home to some of the world's most famous museums and galleries, including the [[Louvre]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]], the city today remains home to a thriving community of artists. Paris is recognized globally for its public landmarks and masterpieces of architecture including the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and a symbol of France, the [[Eiffel Tower]].

==History==
Prior to the 12th century, Paris was not yet famed for its art.{{Sfn|Berger|1999|p=1}} Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[Girardon]], [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired a reputation for being the finest artists in the royal court in 17th century France. [[Pierre Mignard]] became first painter to the king during this period. In this medieval era, depictions of the Virgin Madonna and her Blessed Child were common, and were written to have shown Paris a "protective presence". They were frequently damaged, most of the time intentionally. One source states that one vandalised depiction preternaturally oozed out blood.{{Sfn|Berger|1999|p=22}}

[[File:Van Gogh - Pont du Carrousel mit Louvre.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Vincent Van Gogh]], 1886, ''Pont du Carrousel du Louvre'']]
Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when Paris had a colony of artists established in the city, with art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times. The [[French Revolution]] and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Many painters moved towards using vibrant colours and elements of fantasy in their paintings, and Paris was central to the development of [[Romanticism]] in art, with painters such as [[Géricault]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}

[[Impressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Abstract art]] movements evolved in Paris.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the late 19th century and early 20th century many artists worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions, such as the [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]], to make a name for themselves. 
[[File:Jean Metzinger, Le goûter, Tea Time, 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'', 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. Exhibited at the 1911 [[Salon d'Automne]]. [[André Salmon]] dubbed this painting "The Mona Lisa of Cubism"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lartvivant00salm#page/134/mode/2up André Salmon, ''L'Art Vivant'', Paris, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="André Salmon"&gt;[http://www16.us.archive.org/stream/lartvivant00salm/lartvivant00salm_djvu.txt André Salmon, ''Artistes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui'', L'Art Vivant, 6th edition, Paris, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Paris continued to exert a "strong pull on many aspiring artists from the French provinces" at the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Many people, especially women, were attracted by the city's bohemian culture and anti-bourgeois attitudes and found that the city provided them with an artistic and sexual freedom to express themselves unlike in other areas of France.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Groups of painters also moved to the city from abroad and formed their schools and galleries in the city, increasing its artistic diversity. For instance, the [[Académie Vassilieff]], which was a special school founded for Russian art students, was specially popular with Russian female painters in the early 20th century,{{sfn|Higonett 2009|p=432}} along with the [[Académie de La Palette]], specialized in [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WMDpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=palette#search_anchor Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''A cubism reader: documents and criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, Aug 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Académie Julian]] was established in 1868.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} Painters such as [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]],  [[Juan Gris]], [[María Blanchard]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Amédée Ozenfant]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and many others became associated with Paris. Following the [[Armory Show]] of 1913, New York City increasingly competed with Paris as a hub for artists, and its museums acquired some of the world's most valuable paintings.

==Schools==
In 1648, the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} Many American artists continued to learn their trade in Parisian schools in the 20th century.{{sfn|Higonett 2009|p=432}} From 1900 to 1914, several academies were established in Paris by well-known artists, such as the [[Académie de La Palette]], Académie Alexander Archipenko, [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], Académie Humbert, Académie Matisse, [[Académie Ranson]], Académie Russe de Peinture et de Sculpture, Académie Vasilieff, and [[Académie Vitti]]. Their competition included more established art schools such as the [[Académie Colarossi]], [[Académie Julien]], [[Académie Delécluse]], and [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RVOPnrEcKKsC&amp;pg=PT113&amp;dq=%22Académie+de+La+Palette%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X0ikUaSqMIWBhAfD8ICABw&amp;redir_esc=y Delia Gaze, 'Concise Dictionary of Women Artists'', 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Age of the Paris School ended with World War II when [[surrealism]] became the trend, but Paris remains extremely important to world art and art schooling, with many schools and institutions catering to artists, including the [[Paris College of Art]]. Paris also has numerous institutions which specialize in teaching modern art forms, such as the [[Paris American Academy]], which specializes in teaching fashion and interior design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parisamericanacademy.fr/site/|title=Paris American Academy School of Fashion and Interior Design|publisher=Paris American Academy|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other schools include:

[[The Louvre]] is the world's largest and most famous museum,{{sfn|Nevez|2010|p=18}}{{Sfn|Coburn|Poisson|Vincens|2007|p=20}} housing many works of art, including the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (''La Joconde'') and the ''[[Venus de Milo]]'' statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Masterpieces, Accessible Visitor Trail|publisher=The Louvre|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/routes/masterpieces-0|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the Great Louvre, it is the national museum and art gallery of France. [[Francis I of Beauharnais|Francis I]] ( a connoisseur of Art), initially started building the Louvre as part of the royal palace erected at a location where a 12th-century fortress of [[Philip Augustus]] existed. The palace underwent several additions over the centuries. Finally, after the court moved to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1682, a proposal to convert the Louvre into a public museum was mooted in  the 18th century, and in 1793 Musée Central des Arts in the Grande Galerie was opened to the public. Under [[Napoleon III]], Louvre was further enlarged, and as completed, it has two main quadrilaterals and within two large courtyards. It is considered to possess one of the richest art collections in the world. Its collection is now mainly European art up to the Revolutions of 1848 as paintings of later date have been moved to the [[Orsay Museum]] that opened in 1986. Some of the master pieces held by the museum are of the [[Italian Renaissance]] painters, and [[Flemish]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] painters of the [[Baroque period]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349409/Louvre-Museum|title= Louvre Museum|accessdate=7 July 2013|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other notable galleries in the Louvre are the department of Egyptian antiquities (collection from 1826) and the Mesopotamian art (in the Near Eastern antiquities gallery).&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

Art and artifacts from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] eras are kept in the ''[[Musée de Cluny]]'' and the ''[[Musée d'Orsay]]'', respectively.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=236}} The Musée de Cluny is now named as the [[Musée National du Moyen Âge]]. It is housed in the Hôtel des Abbés de Cluny, a 15th-century monument built in [[Medieval architecture|medieval architectural style]] and also holds the remnants of [[Gallo-Roman thermes]] (baths) dated around to 200 AD, which is called the cool room.

Paris's newest (and third-largest) museum, the [[Musée du quai Branly]], opened its doors in June 2006 and houses art from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, including many from [[Mesoamerican]] cultures. In 1998, under the same French president Jacques Chirac, Maison de la Culture du Japon has opened offices near Eiffel Tower. This place show various exhibits on Japanese Art and Culture in Paris. Few [https://web.archive.org/web/20140505101407/http://www.yakimonos.com/en/ art galleries] have developed around those places. 7th district have been in recent years active location for new museums development.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=224}}

The Orsey Museum is located in a refurbished former Orsay Railway Station ([[Gare d'Orsay]]), a large building in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts architectural style]], on the left bank of the [[Seine River]]. The museum was opened in 1986 and has exhibits of French painting, sculpture, photography, and decorative arts of the mid and late 19th century; French academic painting and sculpture of the 19th century are by many artist "of the late Romantic and Neoclassical, Realist, Barbizon, Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, Divisionist, and Nabi schools."&lt;ref name=Orsay&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/433251/Orsay-Museum|title= Orsay Museum |accessdate=8 July 2013|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Montparnasse|artistic community of Montparnasse]] is chronicled at the ''[[Musée du Montparnasse]]''.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=211}} The Musée du Montparnasse located in the 15th [[arrondissement]], in [[Montparnasse Quarter]] was opened in May 1998. It was the workshop ([[atelier]]) of the [[Russia]]n painter, [[Marie Vassilieff]], in the early 19th century. {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Pic|fr}} and [[Jean-Marie Drot]] established the museum as a nonprofit operation. The museum presents a history of the many well known artists such as [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]], Pablo Picasso, and others. It holds temporary exhibitions of works by Montparnasse artists of the  past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museedumontparnasse.net/|title= Musée du Montparnasse|language=French|accessdate=8 July 2013|publisher=Official web site of Musee du Montparnasse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Paris's once-popular local establishments have come to cater to the tastes and expectations of tourists, rather than local patrons, such as ''[[Le Lido]]'' on the Avenue Champs-Élysées, among others.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=296}} The ''[[Moulin Rouge]]'' cabaret-dancehall, for example, is a staged dinner theatre spectacle, a dance display that was once but one aspect of the cabaret's former atmosphere. All of the establishment's former social or cultural elements, such as its ballrooms and gardens, are gone today.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|pp=160—161}}

==Sculpture==
[[File:Louis XIV statue equestre.JPG|left|thumbnail|100px|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] equestrian statue]]

The city is filled with sculptures.  The [[equestrian statue]] of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in the [[Place Vendôme]] is one of the largest pieces of bronze sculpture ever made, weighing more than 60,000 pounds, and was formed in one cast without a joint.{{Sfn|Elmes 1826|p=147}} Some of the other prominent statues in Paris are ''[[The Thinker]]'', ''[[Venus de Milo]]'', and ''[[Winged Victory of Samothrace]]''.

== Photography ==
Like painting and sculpture, Paris has also attracted communities of photographers, and was an important centre for the development of photography; indeed inventor [[Nicephore Niepce]] produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with [[Louis Daguerre]].{{Sfn|Michelin|2011}} Paris become the home of a form of photography, [[Surrealist photography]].{{Sfn|Hazan|2011|p=362}} Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including [[Eugene Atget]], noted for his depictions of street scenes, [[Robert Doisneau]], noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes, [[Marcel Bovis]], noted for his night scenes, and others such as [[Jacques-Henri Lartigue]] and [[Cartier-Bresson]].{{Sfn|Michelin|2011}} Paris also become the hotbed for an emerging art form in the late 19th century, [[poster art]], advocated by the likes of [[Gavarni]].{{Sfn|Michelin|2011}}

==Events==
The leading French art fair, [[:fr:Foire internationale d'art contemporain|Foire internationale d'art contemporain]] (FIAC), is a manifestation of contemporary art that has taken place every year since 1974 in October in Paris. For several days, this exhibition becomes the international meeting place between galleries, collectors, curators, museum directors and personalities from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiac.com/paris/en|title=FIAC - Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain - Paris|author=Reed Exposition France|work=fiac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another annual art event held in Paris is the Art Paris Art Fair.

An '''artist development deal''' is often the first of a [[recording artist]]'s contracts with a major [[record label]]. In lieu of high [[royalties]] or other desirable rights, the label will promise to develop the skills and [[public profile]] of the artist. These types of deals are sometimes most helpful to the artist, but the label often takes control of the artist's management and publishing rights. Historically, such deals have been abused by both record labels and managers.

In the [[visual arts]] a '''cityscape''' (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or [[urban area]]. It is the urban equivalent of a [[landscape]]. ''Townscape'' is roughly synonymous with ''cityscape,'' though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words ''city'' and ''town''.  In [[urban design]] the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space.  

==History of cityscapes in art==
From the first century A.D. dates a [[fresco]] at the [[Baths of Trajan]] in [[Rome]] depicting a bird's eye view of an ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio la Rocca: "The Newly Discovered City Fresco from Trajan's Baths, Rome." ''Imago Mundi''  Vol. 53 (2001), pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for [[portrait]]s and [[Bible|biblical]] themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] prints and [[etching]]s were made showing cities in [[aerial landscape art|bird's eye view]]. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.

Halfway the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the [[Netherlands]]. In his famous [[View of Delft (Vermeer)|'View of Delft']] in 1660-1661 [[Jan Vermeer]] painted a quite accurate portrait of the city [[Delft]]. Cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]] and [[The Hague]] also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e. [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in [[Venice]] ([[Canaletto]], [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]).

At the end of the 19th century the [[impressionists]] focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of [[everyday life]] in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and [[Rail yard|railway yards]] also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]], and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter [[Edward Hopper]], who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are [[Rackstraw Downes]], [[Antonio López García]], and [[Richard Estes]]. American artist [[Yvonne Jacquette]] has made a specialty of [[aerial landscape art|aerial]] cityscapes. [[Stephen Wiltshire]], a London born artist with autism, is known for his [[panoramic]] cityscape renderings composed from memory, usually after taking a short overhead view of the city he is about to draw.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1223790/Autistic-artist-draws-18ft-picture-New-York-skyline-memory.html|title=Autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire draws spellbinding 18ft picture of New York from memory... after a 20-minute helicopter ride over city|publisher=Daily Mail Reporter

'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE, which conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; It is a departure from the concept of [[mimesis]] which only is concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==History==
Three centuries after Aristotle's ''Poetics'', from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of ''mimesis'' as a [[literary method]] had shifted from "imitation of nature" to "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' three volume work ''On mimesis'' (''On imitation''), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; For Dionysian ''imitatio'', the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"&gt;West (1979) pp.5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that "everything has been said already", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not [[originality]], but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was [[Quintilian]], who shared with him the view of ''imitatio'' as the practice that leads to an [[History of ideas|historical progress]] of literature over time.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss ''imitation'' exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; In Quintilian, and in [[classical rhetoric]] in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the [[four operations of quadripartita ratio]] that organize all the [[figures of speech]], defined as a "ready-made framework" of "relatively mechanical procedures" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008), quote from the summary: {{quotation|The variety of ways to adapt and enrich source texts, as discussed by Erasmus in De Copia Rerum, are discussed in chapter 5. [...] Classical rhetoric had already developed a theory of these kinds of intervention, drawing attention to the process of adaptation [...] If a topic had been treated by an earlier author, this was no reason to avoid it, but one had to try to emulate one's predecessor. The use of rhetoric enabled authors to discuss the same topic in several ways, to be little a great subject, and to accord greatness to something small, for example, or to renew the old, and express the new in an old-fashioned manner. [...] Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of rhetoric was taken by [[Erasmus]] in ''[[De Copia Rerum]]''.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt;

== Mimesis ==
Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of [[mimesis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21564">"'''Eeny, meeny, miny, moe'''" — which can be spelled a number of ways — is a children's [[counting rhyme]], used to select a person in games such as [[tag (game)|tag]]. It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is either "chosen" or "counted out". The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820.&lt;ref&gt;I. &amp; P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 1952), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and is common in many languages with similar-sounding nonsense syllables.

Since many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to ascertain this rhyme's exact original.

== Current versions ==
A common modern version is:&lt;ref name="Donna Wood"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna Wood|title=Move, Sing, Listen, Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCeIvb1PA14C&amp;pg=PA75|year=1971|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=1-4574-9680-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers, let him go, &lt;!-- This is the version given in the 1971 source above; don't change it to "yells" or "squeals" without updating the source. --&gt;
:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

There are many common variations, such as replacing tiger with "piggy", "tinker", "tigger",  a two-syllable name, etc.; and changing the verb in the third line to "screams", "wiggles", "squeals" or another verb.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Sometimes additional lines are added at the end of the rhyme to draw out or manipulate the selection process or make it seem less predetermined, such as:

:My mother told me/says to pick the very best one, and that is Y-O-U&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Or alternatively:

:O-U-T spells out, you are not it.
:Pig snout you are out. ([[Kiwi (people)|Kiwi]]s only)
:Out goes Y-O-U.&lt;ref name=bauer2002&gt;L. and W. Bauer, {{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/research/projects/language-in-the-playground-project/publications/lip17.pdf |title=Choosing Who's In/It |year=2002 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the line copies '[[Ip dip]]':
:Not because you're dirty,
:Not because you're clean,
:Just because you kissed a boy and girl behind the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Abrahams and L. Rankin, ''Counting-out Rhymes: a Dictionary'' (University of Texas Press, 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The first record of a similar rhyme, called the "Hana, man," is from about 1815, when children in [[New York City]] are said to have repeated the rhyme:

:Hana, man, mona, mike;
:Barcelona, bona, strike;
:Hare, ware, frown, vanac;
:Harrico, warico, we wo, wac.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

[[Henry Carrington Bolton]] discovered this version to be in the US, Ireland and Scotland in the 1880s but was unknown in England until later in the century.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt; Bolton also found a similar rhyme in German:

:Ene, tene, mone, mei,
:Pastor, lone, bone, strei,
:Ene, fune, herke, berke,
:Wer? Wie? Wo? Was?&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

Variations of this rhyme, with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s, such as this Scottish one:
:Hickery Pickery, pease scon
:Where will this young man gang?
:He'll go east, he'll go west,
:he'll go to the crow's nest.
:Hickery Pickery, Hickery Pickery&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor ''Chatterings of the Pica'' (1820)&lt;/ref&gt;

More recognizable as a variation, which even includes the 'toe' and 'olla' from Kipling's version, is:
:Eenie, Meenie, Tipsy, toe;
:Olla bolla Domino,
:Okka, Pokka dominocha,
:Hy! Pon! Tush!
This was one of many variants of "counting out rhymes" collected by Bolton in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Cornish language|Cornish]] version collected in 1882 runs:
:Ena, mena, mona, mite,
:Bascalora, bora, bite,
:Hugga, bucca, bau,
:Eggs, butter, cheese, bread.
:Stick, stock, stone dead – OUT.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Jago ''The Glossary of the Cornish Dialect'' (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that the opening to this counting rhyme, "ena mena", is almost identical to the Greek for "one by one" ("ena m'ena").

One theory about the origins of the rhyme is that it is descended from [[Old English]] or [[Celtic languages|Welsh]] counting, similar to the old Shepherd's count "[[Yan Tan Tethera]]" or the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] "Eena, mena, mona, mite".&lt;ref name="opie1997" /&gt;

Another possibility is that British colonials returning from the Sub-Continent introduced a [[doggerel]] version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of [[carom billiards]]:
:ubi eni mana bou,
:baji neki baji thou,
:elim tilim latim gou.&lt;ref name="Mishra"&gt;Nihar Ranjan Mishra, ''From Kamakhya, a socio-cultural study''  (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2004), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhyme inspired the song "Eena Meena Deeka" in the 1957 Bollywood film [[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]].

Another possible origin is from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: ''Iino ya mmiini maiini mo''.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, P.R. (1974). Remarks on a little-known Africanism. ''Ba Shiru'', 6(1), 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most likely the origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon diviner rhyme, as was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologist dr. Jan Naarding, supported by prof. dr. Klaas Heeroma at the Nedersaksisch Instituut (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. They published their findings in an article called ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'' (An old diviner rhyme and its relatives).&lt;ref&gt;J. Naarding en K.H. Heeroma, ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'', in: ''Driemaandelijkse Bladen'', 1957, p. 37-43. Online at the [http://www.twentsetaalbank.nl/media/teksten/13722.html, Twentse Taalbank].&lt;/ref&gt; In part I of the article Naarding explains, why the counting rhyme he found in ''Twents-Achterhoeks woordenboek'' (1948), a dictionary by G.H. Wanink, stands close to an early mediaeval or even older archetype. That same version was recorded in 1904 in Goor in Twente by [[Nynke van Hichtum]]:

:Anne manne miene mukke,
:Ikke tikke takke tukke,
:Eere vrouwe grieze knech,
:Ikke wikke wakke weg.

Naarding calls its origin 'a heathen priest song, that begs the highest goddess for an oracle while divining, an oracle that may decide about life and death of a human'. The first lines can be translated as 'foremother of mankind, give me a sign, I take the cut off pieces of a branch (= the rune wands)."
This explanation was revived and extended in 2016 by Goaitsen van der Vliet, founder of the Twentse Taalbank (Twents Language Bank).&lt;ref&gt;Goaitsen van der Vliet, ''Germaans uit Goor'', in: ''Aold Hoksebarge'', nummer 49.2 (juli 2016), p. 4216-4218. Online at [http://historiek.net/iene-miene-mutte-komt-voort-uit-een-oud-oostnederlands-wichellied/60599/ Historiek] (titled: '' 'Iene miene mutte' komt voort uit oud Oostnederlands wichellied'').&lt;/ref&gt; The last line of the rhyme (in the Netherlands degenerated to 'iet wiet waait weg') can be translated as 'I weigh it up' (in Dutch 'ik wik en weeg').

== American and British versions ==
Some American versions of this rhyme use the word "[[nigger]]" instead of "[[tiger]]":

:Eeny, meena, mina, mo,
:Catch a nigger by the toe;
:If he hollers let him go,
:Eena, meena, mina, mo.&lt;ref name=opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 156-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was similar to that reported by [[Henry Carrington Bolton]] as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888, Kessinger Publishing, 2006), pp. 46 and 105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the chorus of [[Bert Fitzgibbon]]'s 1906 song "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo":

:Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,
:Catch a nigger by his toe,
:If he won't work then let him go;
:Skidum, skidee, skidoo.
:But when you get money, your little bride
:Will surely find out where you hide,
:So there's the door and when I count four,
:Then out goes you.&lt;ref&gt;B. Fitzgibbon, Words and music, "Eeny, meeny, miny, mo"
F. B. Haviland Publishing Co (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also used by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his "A Counting-Out Song", from ''Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides'', published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kipling, R. T. Jones, G. Orwell, eds ''The Works of Rudyard Kipling'' (Wordsworth Editions, 1994), p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

[[Iona and Peter Opie]] pointed out in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' that the word "nigger" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt; This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this post-slavery version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word "[[Wikt:holler|holler]]" was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the words "Niger" or "'nigger" were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme, and it could possibly be that the original 'Where do all the Frenchmen Go?' (probably originating during one of the periods of Anglo-French warfare) was later on replaced by the earlier version in the United States, using some of the nonsense words.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Variations ==
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL VERSIONS TO THIS PAGE UNLESS THEY ARE: clearly related to the original, make some important point (more than just here's also another version) and are fully sourced.--&gt;
There are considerable variations in the lyrics of the rhyme, including from early twentieth century in the United States of America:
:Eeny, meeny, miny moe,
:Catch a tiger by the toe.
:If he hollers make him pay,
:Fifty dollars every day.&lt;ref name=opie1997 /&gt;

During the Second World War, an AP dispatch from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] reported: "Atlanta children were heard reciting this wartime rhyme: 
:Eenie, meenie, minie, moe,
:Catch the emperor by his toe.
:If he hollers make him say:
:'I surrender to the USA.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S8XwCM-EYcC&amp;pg=PA1438|title=Black and African-American Studies: American Dilemma, the Negro Problem and Modern Democracy|last=Myrdal|first=Gunnar|date=1944|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412815116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A distinct version of the rhyme in the United Kingdom, collected in the 1950s &amp; 1960s, is:
:Eeeny, meeny, miney, mo.
:Put the baby on the po.
:When he's done,
:Wipe his bum.
:And tell his mother what he's done.&lt;ref&gt;I. Opie and P.

Versions collected in New Zealand in 2002 include:
:Eeny, meeny, miny mangi,
:Catch a mangi by the tangi.
:If he squeals, steal his wheels,
:Eeny, meeny, miny mangi.&lt;ref name=bauer2002 /&gt;

In Latin America the children play a game to choose or discard players, or to draw a winner/loser, singing:
:De tin marín, de dos pingué,
:cúcara mácara títere fue.
:Yo no fuí, fue Teté,
:pégale pégale a quien fue.

Another Latin American Version:

:De tin marín, de dos pingué,
:cúcara mácara títere fue.
:¿Cuantas patas tiene el caballo?
:Uno,dos, tres, cuatro.

In 1935, [[Billie Holiday]] sang this [[Johnny Mercer]], Matty Malnecka version:
:Eeny meeny miney mo
:Catch your troubles by the toe
:If it hollers let it go
:Let it fly away
:Eeny meeny miney mo
:It's the saying high and low
:Hear it everywhere you go
:Every time of day
:[[Big ben]] rings it
:°Vallee sings it
:°Whitewood swings it
:Even °Mr.Crosby bings it


(°[[Rudy Vallee]]; [[Bing Crosby]]; Whitewood - most likely a once-famous nightclub in the jazz/Swing era.)

== Controversies ==
* In 1993, a high school teacher in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], provoked a student walkout when she asked her students about their poor test scores, "What did you do? Just go eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a nigger by the toe?" The school's district superintendent recommended the teacher "lose three days of pay, undergo racial sensitivity training, and have placed in her personnel file" along with a disciplinary pay cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink |first=Lisa |date=1993-01-19 |title=Longer suspension for teacher urged |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A jocular use of a form of the rhyme by a [[Southwest Airlines]] [[flight attendant]], encouraging passengers to sit down so the plane could take off, led to a 2003 lawsuit charging the airline with [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] and [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]]. Two versions of the rhyme were attested in court; both "Eeny meeny miny mo, Please sit down it's time to go" and "Pick a seat, it's time to go". The passengers in question were [[African Americans|African American]] and stated that they were humiliated due to what they called the "racist history" of the rhyme. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Southwest and the plaintiffs' appeal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2005/08/04-3109.htm |title=Sawyer v. Southwest Airlines |publisher=Ca10.washburnlaw.edu |date=2005-08-12 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2014, an unbroadcast outtake of [[BBC]] motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' showed presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] reciting the rhyme and deliberately mumbling a line which some took to be "catch a nigger by his toe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people/58354/jeremy-clarkson-accused-using-n-word-top-gear |title=Jeremy Clarkson: I didn't mean to use N-word – video&amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Week UK |publisher=Theweek.co.uk |date=2014-05-02 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to accusations of racism, Clarkson apologised to viewers that his attempts to obscure the line "weren't quite good enough".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Halliday, Nicholas Watt and Kevin Rawlinson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/01/jeremy-clarkson-begs-forgiveness-n-word-top-gear |title=Jeremy Clarkson 'begs forgiveness' over N-word footage &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, the retailer [[Primark]] pulled a [[T-shirt]] from its stores that featured the rhyme overlaid with an image of ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'' character [[Negan]]'s [[baseball bat]], dubbed "Lucille." A customer, minister Ian Lucraft, had complained the T-shirt was "fantastically offensive" and claimed the imagery "relates directly to the practice of assaulting black people in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke |first=Darren |date=2017-02-21 |title=Primark pulls "shocking" and "racist" Walking Dead t-shirt from stores after Sheffield man's angry complaint |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/primark-pulls-shocking-and-racist-walking-dead-t-shirt-from-stores-after-sheffield-man-s-angry-complaint-1-8400872 |newspaper=The Star |accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD SONGS WHERE THE RHYME EXISTS ONLY AS PART OF THE LYRIC – THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM --&gt;There are many scenes in books, films, plays, cartoons and video games in which a variant of "Eeny meeny ..." is used by a character who is making a choice, either for serious or comic effect. Notably, the rhyme has been used by killers to choose victims in the 1994 films ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Willis, ''High Contrast: Race and Gender in Contemporary Hollywood Film'' (Duke University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-8223-2041-X}}, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Naisbitt, N. Naisbitt and D. Philips, ''High Tech High Touch: Technology and Our Accelerated Search for Meaning'' (Nicholas Brealey Publishing, 2001), {{ISBN|1-85788-260-1}}, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the 2003 film ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'',&lt;ref&gt;A. Young, ''The Scene of Violence: Cinema, Crime, Affect'' (Routledge, 2009), {{ISBN|1-134-00872-4}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Last Day on Earth (The Walking Dead)|sixth-season finale]] of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''. In ''Let the Tiger Go'', a documentary on tiger conservation released on [[YouTube]] in 2017, the poem is read by [[Alan Rabinowitz]] in advocacy for ending the poaching of tigers for their body parts.&lt;ref name="GoPro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWbu3IM5z7Y|title=Let The Tiger Go - Courtesy of GoPro|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|last=Rabinowitz|first=Alan|date=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very title of the documentary is implied to be an allusion to the poem.

Other uses of the phrase in popular culture include:

=== Music ===
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD SONGS WHERE THE RHYME IS ONLY PART OF THE LYRIC, RATHER THAN A TITLE – THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM --&gt;
The vinyl release of [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997) uses the words "eeny meeny miny moe" (rather than letter or numbers) on the labels of Sides A, B, C and D respectively.&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffiths, ''OK Computer'' (Continuum, 2004), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eenie Meenie Records]] is a Los Angeles-based music record label.

The names of many songs include some or all of the phrase, including:
*[[Eeny Meeny Miny Moe (Luv' song)|Eeny Meeny Miny Moe]] by the Dutch group Luv in 1979
* "Eenie Meenie" by [[Jeffrey Osborne]] on self-titled 1982 album.
* "Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Mo" by Danish pop group [[Toy-Box]] in 1999 from their first album "Fantastic."
* "[[Eenie Meenie]]" by Jamaican-American singer [[Sean Kingston]] and Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] in 2010.
* "Eenie Meenie Minie Moe" by [[Peach Kelli Pop]] from album "Peach Kelli Pop I" recorded in 2010.
* "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe" is a song on [[A Shared Dream]], a 2012 album by South Korea group [[U-KISS]].
* "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!" by Japanese dance and vocal unit [[Sandaime J Soul Brothers from Exile Tribe|Sandaime J Soul Brothers]] on 2015 album "Planet Seven".
* "Eeny Meeny Miny Moe" is a song by Arizona [[hip hop]] trio [[Injury Reserve]] on their 2016 album "[[Floss (album)|Floss]]"
* "Eeny meeny miney mo" by [[Billie Holiday]] in 1935
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD SONGS WHERE THE RHYME IS ONLY PART OF THE LYRIC, RATHER THAN A TITLE – THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM --&gt;

=== Literature ===
The title of [[Chester Himes]]'s novel ''[[If He Hollers Let Him Go]]'' (1945) refers to the rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Muller, ''Chester Himes'' (Twayne, 1989), {{ISBN|0-8057-7545-5}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'' (1995), the leading character and his three sisters are nicknamed Ina, Minnie, Mynah and Moor.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kimmich, ''Offspring Fictions: Salman Rushdie's Family Novels''
(Rodopi, 2008), {{ISBN|9042024909}}, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rex Stout]] wrote a 1962 [[Nero Wolfe]] [[novella]] titled ''[[Eeny Meeny Murder Mo]]''.

=== Film and television ===
&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD SHOWS WHERE THE RHYME IS USED BY A CHARACTER FOR SOME REASON -  - THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM --&gt;
In the 1930s, animation producer [[Walter Lantz]] introduced the cartoon characters [[Meany, Miny, and Moe]] (later Meeny, Miney and Mo). First appearing in [[Oswald Rabbit]] cartoons, then in their own series.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lenburg ''Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film &amp; Television's Award-Winning and Legendary Animators'' (Hal Leonard, 2006), {{ISBN|1-55783-671-X}}, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1933 [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''[[Bosko's Picture Show]]'' parodies [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] as "TNT pictures", whose logo is a roaring and burping lion with the motto "Eenie Meanie Minie Moe" in the place of MGM's "Ars Gratia Artis".

The rhyme appears towards the end of 1949 British [[black comedy]], ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]''. The use of the word ''nigger'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the American market, being replaced by ''sailor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slide |first=Anthony |title=''Banned in the U.S.A..: British Films in the United States and Their Censorship, 1933–1966'' |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOp2WxH5yscC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Kind+Hearts+and+Coronets%22+%2B+alternate+ending&amp;ct=result#PPA90,M1 |accessdate=2008-10-02 |publisher=I.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">The '''European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture''' - '''[[Mies van der Rohe]] Award''' is a Prize given biennially by the [[European Union]] and the [[Fundació Mies van der Rohe]], [[Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miesarch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=3&amp;lang=en Mies Arch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125014431/http://www.miesarch.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=3&amp;lang=en |date=2010-01-25 }}, retrieved 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 'to acknowledge and reward quality architectural production in Europe'.

The Prize was created in 1987 as equal partnerships between the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]] and the Fundació Mies van der Rohe. The award is open to all the works completed in Europe within the two-year period before the granting of the Prize. These works are submitted by independent experts, the national architecture associations and the advisory committee of the Prize and then evaluated by a Jury which is defined for each edition. The five finalist works are visited by the Jury who chooses a Prize Winner and an Emerging Architect Winner.

As of 2016, a new category, the Young Talent Architecture Award (YTAA), highlights the final degree projects of recently graduated architects, landscape architects and urban designers.

'''Femina Potens''' ([[Latin]]: ''Powerful Woman'') is a non-profit [[art gallery]] and [[performance art]] space located in [[San Francisco, California]], founded in 2001 by artistic director [[Madison Young]], which seeks to bring greater visibility and advancement to female artists, including [[transgender]] ones.

==History==
Femina Potens was originally a theater company dedicated to producing original works by local female playwrights, actors, and directors. It was formed in [[Cincinnati]] by Madison Young, who later moved to [[San Francisco]] in 2001 to perform with Woman's Will, the Bay Area's all-woman Shakespeare company. After founding, Femina Potens featured such artists as [[Angela Regas]], [[Mari Schaal]], [[Michelle Tea]], [[Aphrodites Hymen]], Dumbwaiter, [[The Reputation]], [[Blevin Blechdom]], along with open mic [[poetry]] events and anarchist crochet circles.

In 2003 Femina Potens then moved to its {{convert|800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} space in the San Francisco Mission district where the gallery started to flourish. In May 2003 Femina Potens found a fiscal sponsor (SF Media Archive) and in November 2004 changed its fiscal sponsorship to Queer Cultural Center and through them received non-profit status. In the past 4 years Femina Potens has produced nearly 300 art and cultural events for the [[LGBTQ]], women, trans, [[queer]] and kink communities in San Francisco. Producing monthly spoken word open mic events, queer film screenings, music and dance events, and month visual art openings. Femina Potens has been recognized for its work in the community by Bitch Magazine, Curve Magazine, MTV's LOGO, Herbivore Magazine, Japan's FOIL Magazine, HERE TV, QTV, San Francisco Guardian, SF Weekly, SF Chronicle, London's [[Skin Two]] Magazine and more.

In 2007 Femina Potens moved into a {{convert|1300|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} store front space in the [[Castro District]] that had been inhabited for 25 years by Image Leather - a landmark in the Castro neighborhood and the [[leather subculture]]. Located at 2199 Market St. San Francisco CA 94114 one block from the Church MUNI Station.  Tenure there was short, and they now reside at 3435 Cesar Chavez St. in San Francisco.

==Notable artists and events==
Femina Potens has worked to bring the best women and transgender artists to the community, coupling world-renowned visual and performing artists with talented new emerging artists. These multi-generational performances and exhibitions encourage to artists to thrive while well-established artists and heroines stand on the same stage or placed on the same wall acting as mentors for fledgling artists.

Femina Potens has had the honor of presenting such artists as [[Judith Halberstam]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Michelle Tea]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Diane Diprima]], [[Charlie Anders]], [[Thea Hillman]], [[Lynne Breedlove]], [[Nina Hartley]], and collaborating with organizations such as Ladyfest Bayarea, Fresh Meat Productions, United Genders of the Universe, BAVAC, Sex Workers Film and Art Festival, The Center for Sex and Culture.

Femina Potens Exhibition Series is sponsored by the Zellerbach Foundation and our Best of the Bay winning spoken word and open mic series is sponsored by the San Francisco Arts Commission and APOCHE. Femina Potens non profit fiscal sponsor is the Queer Cultural Center.

'''Forgery''' is a [[white-collar crime]] that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a [[legal instrument]] with the specific [[mens rea|intent]] to [[wikt:defraud#English|defraud]] anyone (other than himself or herself).&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tooby"/&gt; Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful [[misrepresentation]]s. Forging [[money]] or [[currency]] is more often called [[counterfeit]]ing. But [[consumer good]]s may also be ''counterfeits'' if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the [[label]] or flagged by the [[trademark]] symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a [[false document]].

This usage of "forgery" does not derive from [[Metalworking|metalwork]] done at a forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of "to [[counterfeit]]" is already in the Anglo-French verb ''forger'', meaning "falsify".

A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself &amp;ndash; what it is worth or what it "proves" &amp;ndash; than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a [[hoax]]. In a hoax, a [[rumor]] or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.

The similar crime of [[fraud]] is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including [[identity theft]]. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by [[security engineering]].

In the 16th century, imitators of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by [[signature forgery|signing]] them "AD", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse]].

A special case of double forgery is the forging of [[Vermeer]]'s paintings by [[Han van Meegeren]], and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son [[Jacques van Meegeren]].

{{expand section|date=August 2012}}

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
In [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 1 of the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person’s prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Legislation.gov.uk]]. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/1 Digitised copy of section 1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Instrument" is defined by section 8, "makes" and "false" by section 9, and "induce" and "prejudice" by section 10.

Forgery is [[triable either way]]. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/6 sections 6(1) to (3)(a)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For offences akin to forgery, see [[English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating]].

The [[common law offence]] of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/section/13 section 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Forgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;W J Stewart and Robert Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|0 00 470009 0}}. Pages 176 and 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803]] was repealed in 2013.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]] which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Statute Book]]. [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0025.html Digitised copy of section 25].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]], section 25(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Any offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0003.html sections 3(2) and (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.&lt;ref&gt;The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0065.html section 65(4)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Forgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].  The offence is a [[Hybrid offence#Canada|hybrid offence]], subject to a maximum prison sentence of:
*if tried [[Summary offence#Canada|summarily]]: 6 months
*if tried [[:wikibooks:Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Forgery|on indictment]]: 10 years

===United States===

Forgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the [[United States]], both state and federal.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;''United States v. Hunt'', [https://casetext.com/case/us-v-hunt-74#p1260 456 F.3d 1255], 1260 ([[10th Cir.]] 2006) ("Historically, forgery was defined as the false making, '''with the intent to defraud''', of a [[legal instrument|document]] which is not what it purports to be, as distinct from a document which is genuine but nevertheless contains a term or representation known to be false.")

==Civil law==
As to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]].

==Documentary art==
Before the invention of [[photography]], people commonly hired painters and engravers to "re-create" an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate based on the information available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.

[[File:Hestia Giustiniani.jpg|thumb|left|Hestia Giustiniani]]
The '''Giustiniani Hestia''' is a finely-executed marble [[sculpture]], a perhaps [[Hadrian]]ic Roman copy of a Greek bronze of about 470 BCE, now in the [[Torlonia Collection]] (see [[Torlonia Museum]]), Rome, but named for its early owner, marchese [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]]. It is the only known Early Classical bronze that was reproduced at full size in marble for a Roman collection: Roman taste ran more towards the [[Hellenistic]] baroque.

==Description==
[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] cited the ''Hestia Giustiniani'' as an example of the austere early stage of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Classical Greek sculpture]]. For female figures, early fifth-century sculptors mostly gave up the crinkly sleeved ''[[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', which had been popular in the later sixth century BCE, and returned to the sleeveless ''[[peplos]]'' with heavy, dominantly vertical folds not unlike the fluting of a column.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the contemporaneous ''[[Charioteer of Delphi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; With the body so shrouded the relaxation of pose has been limited to turning the head. Several Attic or Argive sculptors have been speculatively suggested as the author of the lost original.

==History==
The sculpture was known in the [[Giustiniani]] collection in [[Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome|Palazzo Giustiniani]], Rome, from the early 1630s, the date of a drawing made for the antiquarian [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]]&lt;ref&gt;Now in the archival volumes of his "paper museum" conserved in the Royal collection at [[Windsor Castle]], vol. ix, folio 29 (Lachenal).&lt;/ref&gt; and was illustrated in the engraved catalogue of the Galleria Giustiniani, produced under the direction of [[Joachim von Sandrart]] in two deluxe volumes, 1635–36 and 1638&lt;ref&gt;The ''Hestia'' appears in vol. I, plate XVII (1635-36).&lt;/ref&gt; In its first appearance in a Giustiniani inventory, 1638, it was a ''"vergine vestale vestita, di marmo greco tutta antica alta palmi 9"'' (quoted by Lachenal), "a clothed [[Vestal Virgin]], of Greek marble wholly antique, height 9 palmi."  The sculpture appeared in [[François Perrier (painter)|François Perrier]], ''Segmenta nobilium signorum'' (Paris and Rome, 1638), plate lxxii. The ''Hestia'' was purchased from the Giustiniani heirs in the nineteenth century and re-erected in Palazzo Lungara, where it was described by [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]]. It was removed to the Torlonia [[Villa Albani]] after World War II and was reinstalled in the 1990s in the courtyard of the Palazzo Torlonia in [[via della Conciliazione]].

==Identification==
Contemporary scholars are less certain about the sculpture's identification as Hestia, in part because of literary references to her imageless sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Joseph Goux, "Vesta, or the Place of Being", ''Representations'' '''1''' (February 1983), pp. 91-107.&lt;/ref&gt; though a similar figure is painted on a cup at Berlin attributed to the Sosias Painter (Lachenal): [[Demeter]] and [[Hera]] are alternative candidates. Often such attribution issues are skirted in modern scholarship by designating such sculptures simply as ''peplophoroi'' ("peplum-wearers")

With the rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] in the [[Renaissance]], the poetry of [[Ovid]] became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of '''[[Greek mythology]]''' through subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="BrBurn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;br /&gt;* L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', the [[Leda and the Swan|Ledas]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], and [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]''.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Through the medium of [[Latin]] and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Dante]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature.  Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, [[Chaucer]], the [[Elizabethan]]s and [[John Milton]] were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from [[Shakespeare]] to [[Robert Bridges]] turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. [[Jean Racine]] in [[France]] and [[Goethe]] in [[Germany]] revived Greek drama.&lt;ref name="BrBurn" /&gt; Racine reworked the ancient myths &amp;mdash; including those of [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaidra]], [[Andromache]], Oedipus and [[Iphigeneia]] &amp;mdash; to new purpose.&lt;ref name="Burn75"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Francisco Goya, [[Europa (mythology)|''The rape of Europa'']] ''(El rapto de Europa),'' 1772]]
In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread throughout Europe.  It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the [[libretti]] for [[Handel]]'s operas ''[[Admeto]]'' and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigénie en Aulide]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn75" /&gt; By the end of the century, [[Romanticism]] initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including  Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and [[Homer]]'s works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as [[Keats]], [[Byron]], and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="Burn75-76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[poet laureate]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of [[King Arthur]] are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the [[Parthenon marbles]] in 1816; many of the "Greek" paintings of [[Lord Leighton]] and [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.&lt;ref name="Burn76"&gt;L. Burn, ''Greek Myths'', 76&lt;/ref&gt;

American authors of the 19th century, such as [[Thomas Bulfinch]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.&lt;ref name="Klatt"&gt;Klatt-Brazouski, ''Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulfinch, "The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men.

==Synopsis==
The book investigates a series of murders of wealthy [[Osage people]] that took place in [[Osage County, Oklahoma]] in the early 1920s—after big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers Of The Flower Moon The Osage Murders And The Birth Of The FBI by DAVID GRANN|url=https://www.npr.org/books/titles/523348082/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi|website=NPR|publisher=[[npr.org]]|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers of the Flower Moon THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI By DAVID GRANN|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/208562/killers-of-the-flower-moon-by-david-grann/9780385534246/|publisher=penguinrandomhouse.com|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the count of the murdered full-blood wealthy Osage native Americans reaches at least 20, but Grann suspects that hundreds more may have been killed because of their ties to oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whaley|first1=Monte|title="Killers of the Flower Moon": Murdering the Osage for ill-gotten gains|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/13/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi-book-review/|website=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=denverpost.com|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book reports cattleman [[William Hale (cattleman)|William Hale]] as the mastermind standing behind the murders and presents detailed evidence.

==Reception==
Sean Woods of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "In his masterful new book Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which comes out this week, Grann chronicles a tale of murder, betrayal, heroism and a nation's struggle to leave its frontier culture behind and enter the modern world... Filled with almost mythic characters from our past – stoic Texas Rangers, corrupt robber barons, private detectives, and murderous desperadoes like the Al Spencer gang – Grann's story amounts to a secret history of the American frontier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sean|title='Killers of the Flower Moon': Inside David Grann's New True-Crime Epic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/killers-of-the-flower-moon-inside-new-true-crime-epic-w476689|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=rollingstone.com|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening—and relatively unknown—spree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma during the 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-53424-6|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|publisher=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Vulliamy of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said "The genocide by white America against Native nations during the century leading up to Grann’s period is a metaphor for humanity’s decimation of the natural world which the Natives saw as sacred. Grann’s book is a timely and disturbing chapter in the original, terrible atrocity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vulliamy|first1=Ed|title=Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/01/killers-of-the-flower-moon-david-grann-review|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luxe Grunge''' (also known as '''[[boho-chic]]''' or '''"luxe bohemian"''' &lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[chic]]er updated [[grunge]]-boho collection; an unkempt approach to wardrobe, popularized by celebrities such as the [[Olsen twins]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

First motivated by [[Seattle]]'s groundbreaking rock scene in the 1990s – the modern update contains all the mainstays of yesterday’s grunge (flannel, plaid, layers and leg warmers) alongside today’s sophisticated pieces, including capes, shawls and jackets (''[www.theitlists.com], Sept 2006''). Grunge elements featured strongly in fashion collections in Autumn 2006, including styles referred to "cocktail grunge" and "modern [[Gothic fashion|goth]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lisa Armstrong]], fashion editor of the London ''Times'', referred to [[Patrick Lichfield]]'s iconic 1969 photograph of [[Talitha Getty]] on a Marrakesh roof-top as "typif[ying] the luxe bohemian look" &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain celebrities have been sporting this look, most notably [[Taylor Momsen]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

It is one of the oldest [[performing arts]] in the world.

Modern entertainment magic, as pioneered by 19th century magician [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], has become a popular theatrical art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure|type=H.Res|number=642|date=March 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/642/text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, magicians such as [[John Nevil Maskelyne|Maskelyne]] and [[David Devant|Devant]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Harry Kellar]], and [[Harry Houdini]] achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as "The Golden Age of Magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinmeyer|first=Jim|title=Hiding the Elephant|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, performance magic became a staple of [[Broadway theatre]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]s. Magic retained its popularity in the [[Television|television age]], with magicians such as [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and [[David Blaine]] transitioning away from traditional venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Colin|date=2002|title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre|publisher=Continuum|page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "magic" etymologically derives from the Greek word ''mageia'' (μαγεία). In ancient times, Greeks and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s had been at war for centuries, and the Persian priests, called ''[[magi|magosh]]'' in Persian, came to be known as ''magoi'' in Greek. Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as ''mageia'', and then ''magika''—which eventually came to mean any foreign, unorthodox, or illegitimate ritual practice. During the 17th century, many books were published that described magic tricks. Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s. A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], who had a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. [[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]] in the 1840s. Towards the end of the 19th century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|title=History of Magic|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=This French site, Magiczoom, has now closed its doors.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515125440/http://www.magiczoom.com/history-of-magic.htm|archive-date=2006-05-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials.
Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout [[history]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For many recorded centuries, magicians were associated with the devil and the occult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=THE ART OF DECEPTION or The Magical Affinity Between Conjuring and Art | author=Romano, Chuck | journal=The Linking Ring |date=January 1995 | volume=75 | issue=1 | pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the [[Trojan Horse]] would also have been used for [[entertainment]], or at least for cheating in [[money]] games. They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and [[cult]]s from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents. However, the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the 18th century, and has enjoyed several popular vogues since.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Magic tricks===
{{See also|List of magic tricks}}
Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect, but a number of categories have been developed. Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat, make something seem to disappear, or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief. Magicians may also destroy something, like cutting a head off, and then "restore" it, make something appear to move from one place to another, or they may escape from a restraining device. Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity, making a solid object appear to pass through another object, or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator. Many magic routines use combinations of effects.

[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' (1584), one of the earliest books on magic tricks, explaining how the "Decollation of John Baptist" [[Guillotine (magic trick)|decapitation illusion]] may be performed]]
One of the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony's work of 1489, ''Natural and Unnatural Magic'', which describes and explains old-time tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin|authorlink=Harry Houdini|first=Harry|last=Houdini|page=19|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1584, Englishman [[Reginald Scot]] published ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods, and showing how their "magic tricks" were in reality accomplished. Among the tricks discussed were [[sleight-of-hand]] manipulations with rope, paper and coins.  At the time, fear and belief in [[witchcraft]] was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/05/10-facts-about-magicians/ |title=10 Facts About Magicians – Andi Gladwin&amp;nbsp;– Close-Up Magician |publisher=Illusionist.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=Philip C.|title=King James I and the burning of Reginald Scot's The Discoverie of Witchcraft: The invention of a tradition|journal=Notes and Queries|year=2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=209–213|doi=10.1093/notesj/gjp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks, including ''The Art of Conjuring'' (1614) and ''The Anatomy of Legerdemain: The Art of Juggling'' (c. 1675).

[[File:Fawkesshow.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for [[Isaac Fawkes]]' show from 1724 in which he boasts of the success of his performances for the King and Prince George]]
Until the 18th century, magic shows were a common source of entertainment at [[fair]]s, where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks, as well as the more traditional spectacles of [[sword swallowing]], [[juggling]] and [[fire breathing]]. In the early 18th century, as belief in witchcraft was waning, the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons. A notable figure in this transition was the English showman, [[Isaac Fawkes]], who began to promote his act in advertisements from the 1720s – he even claimed to have performed for [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. One of Fawkes' advertisements described his routine in some detail:
{{quote|He takes an empty bag, lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out, then commands 100 Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver, then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table. He throws up a Pack of Cards, and causes them to be living birds flying about the room. He causes living Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures to appear upon the Table. He blows the spots of the Cards off and on, and changes them to any pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Christopher | first = Milbourne | title = Magic: A Picture History | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 1991| location=New York|isbn=0-486-26373-8|page=16| origyear=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1756 to 1781, [[Jacob Philadelphia]] performed feats of magic, sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions, throughout [[Europe]] and in [[Russian Empire|Russia]].

===Modern stage magic===
[[File:roberthoudin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], pioneer of modern magic entertainment]]
A founding figure of modern entertainment magic was [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]], originally a clockmaker, who opened a magic theatre in [[Paris]] in 1845. He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre. His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive. Many of Robert-Houdin's mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals, [[John Henry Anderson]] and [[Alexander Herrmann]].

[[John Henry Anderson]] was pioneering the same transition in [[London]]. In 1840 he opened the New Strand Theatre, where he performed as ''The Great Wizard of the North''. His success came from [[advertising]] his shows and captivating his audience with expert [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]]. He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown. He opened a second theatre in [[Glasgow]] in 1845.

[[File:John Nevil Maskelyne.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Nevil Maskelyne]], a famous magician and illusionist of the late 19th century.]]
Towards the end of the century, large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm.&lt;ref name="History of Magic"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom|British]] performer [[John Nevil Maskelyne|J N Maskelyne]] and his partner Cooke were established at the [[Egyptian Hall]] in [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly]] in 1873 by their manager [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]], and continued there for 31 years. The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic (often [[Orientalism|Oriental]]) imagery. The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants, and the control it offers over the audience's point of view.
Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today – one of his best-known being [[Levitation (illusion)|levitation]].&lt;ref name="Dawes_2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Great Illusionists|first=Edwin|last=Dawes|publisher=Chartwell Books Inc.|year=1979|page=161|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the look of a 'typical' magician—a man with wavy hair, a top hat, a goatee, and a tailcoat—was [[Alexander Herrmann]] (February 10, 1844&amp;nbsp;– December 17, 1896), also known as Herrmann the Great.  Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the "first-family of magic".

The escapologist and magician [[Harry Houdini]] took his stage name from Robert-Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks, many of them based on what became known after his death as [[escapology]]. Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets, but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques, including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience. Houdini's show business savvy was as great as his performance skill. There is a [[Houdini Museum]] dedicated to him in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].

[[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] was formed in London in 1905  to promote and advance the art of stage magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/about-the-club|title=About The Magic Circle|author=Jack Delvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of entertainment, magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials, which opened up new opportunities for deceptions, and brought stage magic to huge audiences. Famous magicians of the 20th century included [[Okito]], [[David Devant]], [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]], [[Harry Blackstone Jr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Theodore Annemann]], [[Richard Valentine Pitchford|Cardini]], [[Joseph Dunninger]], [[Dai Vernon]], [[Fred Culpitt]], [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Doug Henning]]. Popular 20th- and 21st-century magicians include [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[James Randi]], [[Penn and Teller]], [[David Blaine]], [[Criss Angel]], [[Hans Klok]] and [[Derren Brown]]. Well-known women magicians include [[Dell O'Dell]] and [[Dorothy Dietrich]]. Most television magicians perform before a live audience, who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post-production [[visual effects]].

Many of the principles of stage magic are old. There is an expression, "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to explain something baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous [[Pepper's Ghost]], a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.

==Types of magic performance==
Magic is often described according to various specialities or genres.
[[File:Mind-reading-Russell-Morgan.jpeg|thumb|upright|A [[mentalist]] on stage in a mind-reading performance, 1900]]
[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amateur]] magician performing "children's magic" for a birthday party audience]]
*'''[[Stage illusions]]''' are performed for large audiences, typically within a theatre or auditorium. This type of magic is distinguished by large-scale props, the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers. Famous stage illusionists, past and present, include [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.]], [[Howard Thurston]], [[Chung Ling Soo]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Lance Burton]], [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]]
*'''[[Parlor magic]]'''  is done for larger audiences than close-up magic (which is for a few people or even one person) and for smaller audiences than stage magic. In parlor magic, the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience, which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians'' by T.A. Waters, "The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance." Also, many magicians consider the term "parlor" old fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. A better term for this branch of magic may be "platform", "club" or "cabaret". Examples of such magicians include [[Jeff McBride]], [[David Abbott (magician)|David Abbott]], [[Channing Pollock (magician)|Channing Pollock]], [[Black Herman]], and [[Fred Kaps]]. 
*'''[[Micromagic]]''' (also known as '''close-up magic''' or '''table magic''') is performed with the audience close to the magician, sometimes even one-on-one. It usually makes use of everyday items as props, such as [[playing card|cards]] (see [[Card manipulation]]), [[coin]]s (see [[Coin magic]]), and seemingly 'impromptu' effects. This may be called "table magic", particularly when performed as dinner entertainment. [[Ricky Jay]], [[Mahdi Moudini]], and [[Lee Asher]], following in the traditions of [[Dai Vernon]], [[Slydini]], and [[Max Malini]], are considered among the foremost practitioners of close-up magic.
*'''[[Escapology]]''' is the branch of magic that deals with escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Harry Houdini]] is a well-known example of an ''escape artist'' or ''escapologist''.
*'''[[Pickpocket]]''' magicians use magic to misdirect the audience while removing wallets, belts, ties and other personal effects. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known pickpockets include [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[David Avadon]], [[Bob Arno]], and [[Apollo Robbins]].
*'''[[Mentalism]]''' creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts, predict events, control other minds, and similar feats. It can be presented on a stage, in a cabaret setting, before small close-up groups, or even for one spectator. Well-known mentalists of the past and present include [[Alexander (magician)|Alexander]], [[The Zancigs]], [[Axel Hellstrom]], [[Dunninger]], [[Kreskin]], [[Derren Brown]], [[Rich Ferguson (magician)|Rich Ferguson]], [[Guy Bavli]], [[Banachek]], and [[Alain Nu]].
*'''[[Theatrical séances]]''' simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect. This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits.
*'''[[Children's magic]]''' is performed for an audience primarily composed of children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday schools or libraries. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants.
*'''Online magic tricks''' were designed to function on a computer screen. The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmagic.net/dp/1-1.htm |title=online magic tricks magical illusions |publisher=Real Magic |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a [[viral phenomenon]] that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that [[Snopes]] dedicated a page to debunking the trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/psychic.asp |title=Online Psychic Trick |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Mathemagician|Mathemagic]]''' is a genre of stage magic that combines magic and [[mathematics]]. It is commonly used by [[children's magic]]ians and [[mentalists]].
*'''Corporate magic''' or '''trade show magic''' uses magic as a communication and sales tool, as opposed to just straightforward entertainment. Corporate magicians may come from a business background and typically present at meetings, conferences and product launches. They run workshops and can sometimes be found at trade shows, where their patter and illusions enhance an entertaining presentation of the products offered by their corporate sponsors. Pioneer performers in this arena include Eddie Tullock&lt;ref name="Herz1991"&gt;Bill Herz with Paul Harris. ''Secrets of the Astonishing Executive''(New York, NY: Avon Books, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guy Bavli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-magicians.com/guy-bavli.html |title=Guy Bavli – Biography |publisher=All About Magicians.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masterofthemind.com/press/Guy%20Bavli%20-%20dream-team%20IBC%20Award-PR2000.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Gospel magic]]''' uses magic to catechize and evangelize. Gospel magic was first used by [[St. Don Bosco]] to interest children in 19th-century [[Turin]], [[Italy]] to come back to school, to accept assistance and to attend church.
*'''[[Street magic]]''' is a form of street performing or [[busking]] that employs a hybrid of stage magic, platform and close-up magic, usually performed '[[theatre in the round|in the round]]' or surrounded by the audience. Notable modern street magic performers include [[Jeff Sheridan]] and [[Gazzo (magician)|Gazzo]]. Since the first [[David Blaine]] TV special ''Street Magic'' aired in 1997, the term "street magic" has also come to describe a style of 'guerilla' performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street. Unlike traditional street magic, this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public. Magicians of this type include [[David Blaine]] and [[Cyril Takayama]].
*'''[[Bizarre magic]]''' uses [[Mysticism|mystical]], [[horror (genre)|horror]], [[fantasy]], and other similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is typically performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a stage setting. [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] has generally been credited as the "godfather of bizarre magic". Others such as [[Tony Andruzzi]] have contributed significantly to its development.
*'''Shock magic''' is a genre of magic that shocks the audience. Sometimes referred to as "geek magic", it takes its roots from circus [[sideshow]]s, in which 'freakish' performances were shown to audiences. Common shock magic or geek magic effects include eating razor blades, [[needle-through-arm]], string through neck and pen-through-tongue.,
*'''Comedy magic''' is the use of magic in which is combined with stand-up comedy. Famous comedy magicians include [[The Amazing Johnathan]], [[Mac King]], and [[Penn &amp; Teller]].
*'''Quick change magic''' is the use of magic which is combined with the very quick changing of costumes. Famous quick change artists include Sos &amp; Victoria Petrosyan.
*'''Camera magic''' (or "video magic") is magic that is aimed at viewers watching broadcasts or recordings. It includes tricks based on the restricted viewing angles of cameras and clever editing. Camera magic often features paid extras posing as spectators who may even be assisting in the performance. Camera magic can be done live, such as [[Derren Brown]]'s lottery prediction. Famous examples of camera magic include David Copperfield's Floating Over the Grand Canyon and many of [[Criss Angel]]'s illusions.
*'''Classical Magic''' is a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Notable classical magicians today include Yu Ho-Jin and Ryan Lally.

==Categories of effects==
Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways. Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect, and disagreement as to what categories actually exist. For instance, some magicians consider "penetrations" a separate category, while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation. Some magicians today, such as [[Guy Hollingworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Guy. "Waiting For Inspiration." Genii Magazine. January 2008 – December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tom Stone (magician)|Tom Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Tom. "Lodestones." Genii Magazine. February 2009 -&lt;/ref&gt; have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories. Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories (such as [[Dariel Fitzkee]], [[Harlan Tarbell]], S.H. Sharpe), there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are. Some of these are listed below.

*'''Production''': The magician produces something from nothing—a rabbit from an empty hat, a fan of cards from thin air, a shower of coins from an empty bucket, a [[Dove pan|dove from a pan]], or the magician himself or herself, appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage—all of these effects are ''productions''.
*'''Vanish''': The magician makes something disappear—a coin, a cage of doves, milk from a newspaper, an assistant from a cabinet, or even the [[Vanishing the Statue of Liberty|Statue of Liberty]]. A vanish, being the reverse of a production, may use a similar technique in reverse.
*'''Transformation''': The magician transforms something from one state into another—a silk handkerchief changes color, a lady turns into a [[tiger]], an indifferent card changes to the spectator's chosen card. [[File:Proyecto - cambio de color.ogv|thumb|Transformation: Change of color]]
*'''Restoration''': The magician destroys an object—a rope is cut, a newspaper is torn, a [[sawing a woman in half|woman is cut in half]], a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces—then restores it to its original state.
*'''Transposition''': This is whereby two or more objects are used in play. The magician will cause these objects to change places, as many times as he pleases, and in some cases, ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else. 
*'''Transportation''': The magician causes something to move from one place to another—a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool, a canary inside a light bulb, an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre, or a coin from one hand to the other. When two objects exchange places, it is called a transposition: a simultaneous, double transportation. A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production.  When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation.
*'''Escape''':  The magician (or less often, an assistant) is placed in a restraining device (i.e., [[handcuffs]] or a [[straitjacket]]) or a death trap, and escapes to safety. Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water, and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher.
*'''[[Levitation (illusion)|Levitation]]''': The magician defies gravity, either by making something float in the air, or with the aid of another object (suspension)—a silver ball floats around a cloth, an assistant floats in mid-air, another is suspended from a broom, a scarf dances in a sealed bottle, the magician hovers a few inches off the floor. There are many popular ways to create this illusion, including [[Asrah levitation]], [[Balducci levitation]], and [[King levitation]]. The [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying illusion]] has often been performed by [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] and more recently by [[Peter Marvey]].  [[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Harry Blackstone]] floated a light bulb over the heads of the public.
*'''Penetration''': The magician makes a solid object pass through another—a set of steel rings link and unlink, a candle penetrates an arm, swords pass through an assistant in a basket, a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop, or a man walks through a mirror. Sometimes referred to as "solid-through-solid".
*'''Prediction''': The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event—a newspaper headline, the total amount of loose change in the spectator's pocket, a picture drawn on a slate—under seemingly impossible circumstances.

Many magic routines use combinations of effects. For example, in "[[cups and balls]]" a magician may use vanishes, productions, penetrations, teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation.

The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science (often a branch of physics) while the performance aspect is more of an art form.

The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drachen.org/article/magician%E2%80%99s-oath-conversation-pat-hammond-magic-science-and-wind|title=The Magician's Oath: A Conversation with Pat Hammond on Magic, Science, and the Wind {{!}} Drachen Foundation|website=www.drachen.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic. Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians.

From the 1584 publication of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'' until the end of the 19th century, only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft, whereas today mass-market books offer a myriad titles. Videos and DVDs are a newer medium of tuition, but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books. However, they can serve as a visual demonstration.

Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join [[magic club]]s. Here magicians, both seasoned and novitiate, can work together and help one another for mutual improvement, to learn new techniques, to discuss all aspects of magic, to perform for each other—sharing advice, encouragement, and criticism. Before a magician can join one of these clubs, they usually have to audition. The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets.

The world's largest magic organization is the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]; it publishes a monthly journal, ''[[The Linking Ring]]''. The oldest organization is the [[Society of American Magicians]], which publishes the monthly magazine ''[[M-U-M]]'' and of which [[Houdini]] was a member and president for several years. In [[London]], [[England]], there is [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], which houses the largest magic library in Europe. Also PSYCRETS—The British Society of Mystery Entertainers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S.J.Drury [web-aviso.com] |url=http://www.psycrets.org.uk |title=psycrets.org.uk |publisher=psycrets.org.uk |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;—caters specifically to mentalists, bizarrists, storytellers, readers, spiritualist performers, and other mystery entertainers.

Traditionally, magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience. Membership in professional magicians' organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non-magicians. Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres. [[Stage illusions]] use large-scale props and even large animals. [[Platform magic]] is performed for a medium to large audience. [[Close-up magic]] is performed with the audience close to the magician. [[Escapology]] involves escapes from confinement or restraints. [[Pickpocket]] magicians take audience members' wallets, belts, and ties. 
[[Mentalism]] creates the illusion that the magician can read minds. Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand-up comedy, an example being [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic. These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance. Examples include fraudulent mediums, [[Confidence trick|con men]] and grifters who use deception for cheating at [[card game]]s.

==Misuse of magic==

Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception. Most of these performers therefore eschew the term "magician" (which they view as making a claim to supernatural power) in favor of "illusionist" and similar descriptions; for example, the performer [[Jamy Ian Swiss]] makes these points by billing himself as an "honest liar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|title=Deception's his tool (but he's no politician)|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/10/31/Deception-s-his-tool-but-he-s-no-politician/stories/200810310191|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, many performers say that magical acts, as a form of theatre, need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film; this policy is advocated by the magician and mentalist [[Joseph Dunninger]], who states "For those who believe, no explanation is necessary; for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorable-quotes.com/joseph+dunninger,a4219.html |title=Memorable-Quotes.com |publisher=Memorable-Quotes.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, more than thirty years after the hugely successful illusionist [[Uri Geller]] made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote may be said to apply.

Less fraught with controversy, however, may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ conjuring techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance.

Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain. From the 1840s to the 1920s, during the greatest popularity of the [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism religious movement]] as well as public interest in [[séance]]s, a number of fraudulent mediums used conjuring methods to perform illusions such as table-knocking, slate-writing, and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] effects, which they attributed to the actions of [[ghosts]] or other spirits. The great escapologist and illusionist [[Harry Houdini]] devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Houdini. A Magician Among the Spirits (New York: Harper and Bros., 1924)&lt;/ref&gt;  Magician [[James Randi]], magic duo [[Penn and Teller|Penn &amp; Teller]], and the mentalist [[Derren Brown]] have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |work=SWIFT Newsletter |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ One-Million-Dollar Challenge] from MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraudulent [[faith healers]] have also been shown to employ [[sleight of hand]] to give the appearance of removing chicken-giblet "tumors" from patients' abdomens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= The Skeptic's Dictionary |url= http://skepdic.com/psurgery.html |title= Psychic 'surgery' |author= Robert T. Carroll |date= 2009-02-23 |accessdate= 2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confidence trick|Con men]] and grifters too may use techniques of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at [[card game]]s is an obvious example, and not a surprising one: one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, ''The Expert at the Card Table'' by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as "Find the Lady" or "[[Three-card Monte]]" is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the [[shell game]], in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankenstein. "8 Arrested in Downtown Shell-Game Operation," [[Los Angeles Times]], December 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researching magic==

Because of the secretive nature of magic, research can sometimes be a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Magic &amp; magicians http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic&lt;/ref&gt; Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana. However, organizations exist to band together independent collectors, writers, and researchers of magic history, including the Magic Collectors' Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magicol.magicana.com/ |title=Magic Collectors |publisher=Magicana |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention; and the [[Conjuring Arts Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conjuringarts.org/ |title=conjuringarts.org |publisher=conjuringarts.org |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine, and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals.

Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=83646&amp;sid=620815#1981235 |title=Magicians – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the time.

Many books have been written about magic tricks; so many are written every year that at least one magic author&lt;ref&gt;Bart King, The Pocket Guide to Magic, Gibbs Smith, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art. Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores, the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers.

Several notable public research collections on magic are the ''WG Alma Conjuring Collection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/magic |title=Get started – Magic &amp; magicians – Research Guides at State Library of Victoria |publisher=Guides.slv.vic.gov.au |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the State Library of Victoria; the ''R.

[[Image:Mari euskal jainkosa.jpg|thumb|250px|Modern rendering of Mari by Josu Goñi]]

'''Mari''', also called Mari Urraca, Anbotoko Mari ("the lady of [[Anboto]]"), and Murumendiko Dama ("lady of [[Murumendi]]") was a [[goddess]]—a ''[[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamia]]''—of the [[Basque people|Basques]]. She was married to the [[deity|god]] [[Sugaar]] (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travelled together [[hail]] would fall, her departures from her cave would be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lived in at different times would determine dry or wet weather: wet when she was in [[Anboto]]; dry when she was elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she was said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of [[Gurutzegorri]] ([[Ataun]]), [[Aizkorri]] and [[Aralar Range|Aralar]], although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered to pertain to the same lamia{{fact|date=September 2016}}.

== Etymology ==
It is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;This derives from articles in the ''Enciclopedia General Ilustrada del Pais Vasco'' ''[[Encyclopedia Auñamendi]]'', which in turn cite ''Euskalerriaren Yakintza'', Tomo I "Costumbres y supersticiones", by folklorist [[Resurrección María de Azkue]] (1864-1951). It notes that additional legends were recorded by [[Jose Miguel Barandiaran]] and [[Juan Thalamas Labandibar]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first known written citation of the "Dame of Amboto" was made by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s chronicler [[Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa]] in his [[Memorial histórico español]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa]], ''Memorial histórico español: colección de documentos, opúsculos y antigüedades'', Tomo VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs associated with Mari==
[[Image:Amboto 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Anboto is one of the mountains where Mari is supposed to live]]

Mari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort [[Sugaar]] meet every Friday (the night of the ''[[Akelarre (witchcraft)|Akelarre]]'' or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of ''[[sorginak]]'' (witches), and is said to feed "on the negation and affirmation" (that is, on falsehood).

Occasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (''[[Lamia (Basque mythology)|lamiak]]'', ''[[jentilak]]'', etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields.

In various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, [[Atxular]] and [[Mikelatz]]. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the [[Devil]] in a church in [[Salamanca]] and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, [[Hodei]], or embodied as a young red bull.

Another legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of [[Biscay]], [[Diego López I de Haro]]. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the [[sign of the cross]]. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose.

Other legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way.

The people of [[Oñati]] believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in [[Aloña]]. In [[Zeanuri]], [[Biscay]], they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in [[Oiz]] called [[Supelegor]]. A similar legend in [[Olaeta]], Biscay substitutes [[Gorbea]] for Supelegor.

A legend from [[Otxandio]], Biscay tells that Mari was born in [[Lazkao]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and that she was the evil sister of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]].  In other legends, the priest is her cousin [[Juanito Chistu]], rather than a brother, and is a great hunter.  She was said to take a [[distaff]] by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake.

In [[Elorrieta]], Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of [[sin]].

Folklorist [[Resurrección María de Azkue]] ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the [[Merindad de Durango]].  She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto.  According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his ''Historia de Vizcaya.'' Labayru in her ''Historia de Vizcaya'' doubts it.

Legends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a [[witch]] for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about.  In [[Beizama]], Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented.  They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, ''"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo"'' ("Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven").&lt;ref&gt;The meaning of "Murua" is obscure, but it might perhaps refer to the small village of {{ill|Murua, Spain|lt=Murua|eu|Murua}} near Beizama. It may be impossible to be certain.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patxi Xabier Lezama Perier |title=Basque Mythology: History of the myths and deities of the Basque Mythology |date=2018 |location=Euskadi Public Reading Network / Google |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Basque_Mythology_History_of_the_myths_and_deities_?id=vlpZDwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=en_US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mari was associated with various forces of nature, including [[thunder]] and [[wind]].  As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with [[Lurbira]].

Mari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch.  She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her [[Cult image|idols]] usually feature a full [[moon]] behind her head.

Mari is the main character of [[Basque mythology]], having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat.

==Christianization==
[[Saint Marina of Aguas Santas|Santa Marina]], a saint revered in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth.

The most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.

'''Morris Kestelman''' (5 October 1905 – 15 June 1998) was a British artist and teacher. Kestelman was a full-time art teacher and only began exhibiting on a regular basis towards the end of his life and is now best known for the paintings of working people and landscapes he produced during the 1940s and 1950s as well as his later abstract work.&lt;ref name=IndieMK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-morris-kestelman-1165678.html|title=Obituary: Morris Kestelman|author=Agi Katz|date=17 June 1998|accessdate= 29 June 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritMK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=119100|title=Morris Kestelman (Biographical details)|author=|date=|accessdate= 29 June 2016|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kestelmans' parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia and he was born and raised in the midst of the Jewish community in [[Whitechapel]] in the East End of London, where his father worked as a cabinet maker.&lt;ref name="PalMac"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.Rubinstein &amp; Michael A. Jolles (Editors)|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=2011|title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History|ISBN=978-0-230-30466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kestelman obtained a scholarship to the [[Central School of Art and Design]] in 1922, where his teachers included both [[Archibald Standish Hartrick|A.S. Hartrick]] and [[Bernard Meninsky]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Grant M. Waters|publisher=Eastbourne Fine Art|year=1975|title=Dictionary of British Artists Working 1900-1950|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meninsky introduced Kestelman, who became a lifelong friend, to the [[London Group]] and he, Kestelman, helped with the organization of the Group's 1926 exhibition. Hartricks' teaching led Kestelman to an appreciation of French art and he would visit France for extended periods most years from 1930 onwards.

After graduating from the Central School in 1925, Kestelman enrolled at the [[Royal College of Art]] where he studied until 1929.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he developed a talent for theatre and stage design such that he created a number of costume designs for a 1929 production of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. Later he created sets for ''[[Carmen]]'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] in 1940 and for several productions by the [[Old Vic Theatre|Old Vic]] Company including the 1944 staging of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''  starring [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]].&lt;ref name=IndieMK/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1282956/morris-kestelman-design-for-richard-set-design-kestelman-morris/|title=Morris Kestelman design for Richard III |date=|accessdate=29 June 2016|work= [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher [[Noel Carrington]] commissioned Kestelman to produce a large series of pastel drawings for a book on the [[Bertram Mills Circus]]. The book was never published due to the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="PalMac"/&gt;

During World War Two, Kestelman served as a full-time [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|air-raid warden]] and also drew scenes of workers at an aircraft repair factory. One of these drawings was subsequently purchased by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] and is now held by the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=IWMmk&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050001271|title=War artists archive, M Kestelman |year=|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the War, in 1943, when reports of the [[Holocaust]] first reached Britain, Kestelman responded with the painting ''Lama Sabachthani (Why have you forsaken me?)'', whose title is taken from a line in [[Psalm 22]].&lt;ref name=Response&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Talarico &amp; Gemma Lawrence|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/artists-responses-to-the-holocaust |title=Artists' Response To The Holocaust |year=|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DJames&gt;{{cite web |author=Dan James|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art60507|title=Artists As Witness To The Holocaust At Imperial War Museum|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=Culture 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was first exhibited at the 1943 ''For Liberty'' exhibition organised by the [[Artists' International Association]] in the shelter constructed on the bomb site of the John Lewis department store on [[Oxford Street]] in central London.&lt;ref name="WW2Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2007|title=Art from the Second World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching at [[Wimbledon School of Art]], in 1951 Kestelman secured the post of Head of the Painting and Sculpture School at the Central School of Art and Design. He held this post until 1971. Although during this period his time for painting was largely restricted to the college holidays, he still made time to experiment with his art and developed a highly abstract style. Murals by Kestelman were included in exhibitions at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in both 1946 and 1960.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Memorial exhibitions for Kestelman were held at the Boundary Gallery and at the Friends Room of the Royal Academy in 2001.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Further exhibitions of his work were held at [[Lauderdale House]] in 2002 and 2003 and at the [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Kestelman also exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], with the [[London Group]] and with the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"/&gt;

Kestelman married Dorothy Mary Creagh, a dress designer, in 1936 and the couple had one child, the actress [[Sara Kestelman]].&lt;ref name=katek&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/mar/24/sara-kestelman-4000-miles-interview|title=Sara Kestelman: 'I didn't enjoy my immersion in Shakespeare.

'''Music recording certification''' is a system of certifying that a music [[Sound recording|recording]] has shipped, sold, or streamed a certain number of units. The threshold quantity varies by type (such as album, [[single (music)|single]], [[music video]]) and by nation or territory (see [[List of music recording certifications]]).

Almost all countries follow variations of the [[RIAA certification]] categories, which are named after precious materials ([[gold]], [[platinum]] and [[diamond]]).

The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released. Typically, they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold. Different sales levels, some perhaps 10 times lower than others, may exist for different music media (for example: videos versus [[album]]s, singles, or downloads).

== History ==
The original gold and silver record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize their sales achievements. The first silver disc was awarded by [[Regal Zonophone]] to [[George Formby]] in December 1937 for sales of 100,000 copies of "[[The Window Cleaner]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgeformby.co.uk/alan_randall/memorobilia/list.htm |title=Alan's treasured possessions |work=Alan Randall's Memorabilia |accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUFMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;lpg=PT54 |title=George Formby: An Intimate Biography of the Troubled Genius |publisher=Lulu Press |first=David |last=Bret |page=54 |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-291-87257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gold disc was awarded by [[RCA Victor]] (under division imprint [[Bluebird Records]])  to [[Glenn Miller and His Orchestra]] in February 1942, celebrating the sale of 1.2 million copies of single "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]". Another example of a company award is the gold record awarded to [[Elvis Presley]] in 1956 for one million units sold of his single "[[Don't Be Cruel]]". The first gold record for an [[LP record|LP]] was awarded by RCA Victor to [[Harry Belafonte]] in 1957 for the album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956), the first album to sell over 1,000,000 copies in RCA's reckoning.

At the industry level, in 1958 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] introduced its gold record award program for records of any kind, [[LP record|albums]] or [[single (music)|singles]], which achieved one million dollars in retail sales. These sales were restricted to U.S.-based record companies and did not include exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="Venable2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gold: A Cultural Encyclopedia |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |first=Shannon L. |last=Venable |year=2011 |isbn= 0-313-38431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelton1986"&gt;{{cite book |title=No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |first=Robert |last=Shelton |page=389 |year=1986 |isbn=0-688-05045-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For albums in 1968, this would mean shipping approximately 250,000 units; for singles the number would be higher due to their lower retail price.&lt;ref name="Shelton1986" /&gt; The platinum certification was introduced in 1976 for the sale of one million units for albums and two million for singles, with the gold certification redefined to mean sales of 500,000 units for albums and one million for singles.&lt;ref name="White1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book of Gold &amp; Platinum Records |publisher=Billboard Books |first=Adam |last=White |page=viii |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-7119-2196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No album was certified platinum prior to this year. For instance, the recording by [[Van Cliburn]] of [[Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 (Van Cliburn 1958 recording)|the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto]] from 1958 would eventually be awarded a platinum citation, but this would not happen until two decades after its release. In 1999, [[list of best-selling albums in the United States|the diamond certification]] was introduced for sales of ten million units. In the late 1980s, the certification thresholds for singles were dropped to match that of albums.&lt;ref name="White1990" /&gt;

=== RIAA certification ===
{{Main|RIAA certification}}
[[File:Artie's Gold Record.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Gold record presented to [[Artie Schroeck]] for his arrangement on "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", 1967]]
The first official designation of a "gold record" by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was established for [[single (music)|singles]] in 1958, and the RIAA also [[trademark]]ed the term "gold record" in the United States. On 14 March 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, [[Perry Como]]'s hit single "[[Catch a Falling Star]]". The ''[[Oklahoma! (soundtrack)|Oklahoma!]]'' soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] compilation album ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' on 24 February 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Eagles&amp;ti=Their+greatest+hits&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH# |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Eagles/Their Greatest Hits 1971 - 1975 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Johnnie Taylor]]'s single "[[Disco Lady]]" on 22 April 1976.&lt;ref name="riaa-story"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/story/ |title=Story of Gold &amp; Platinum |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=&amp;ti=&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=P&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH&amp;col=certification_date&amp;ord=asc#search_section |title=Gold &amp; Platinum: Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.&lt;ref name="riaa-award-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards/ |title=About the Awards |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, and for a part of the first decade of the 21st, it was common for distributors to claim certifications based on their shipments – wholesale to retail outlets – which led to many certifications which outstripped the actual final retail sales figures. This became much less common once the majority of retail sales became paid digital downloads and digital streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunecore.com/blog/2011/04/getting-a-gold-record-by-selling-nothing.html |title=Getting A Gold Record By Selling Nothing |publisher=TuneCore |first=Jeff |last=Price |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media certification ===
In most countries certifications no longer apply solely to physical media but now also include sales awards recognizing digital [[download]]s (in the U.S. and U.K. since 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodbye, 2004. Hello, 2005!|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&amp;resultpage=30&amp;id=D518ECA3-C7F5-6CDB-F346-A6E9BDEF73C9|publisher=Recording Industry Association of American|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, the RIAA also certified the [[ringtone]] downloads of songs. Streaming from on-demand services such as [[Apple Music]],
[[Spotify]], [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] and [[Napster (streaming music service)|Napster]] has been included into existing digital certification in the U.S since 2013 and the U.K. and Germany since 2014. In the U.S. and Germany video streaming services like [[YouTube]], [[VEVO]], and [[Yahoo! Music]] also began to be counted towards the certification, in both cases using the formula of 100 streams being equivalent to one download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold &amp; Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161215/http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=5&amp;id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stream"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |title=Exclusive: On-Demand Streams Now Count Toward RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum|author= Alex Pham |date= 9 May 2013 |work=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|title=Neuer DIAMOND AWARD für die erfolgreichsten Singles und Alben in Deutschland|publisher=Bundesverband Musikindstie|accessdate=15 May 2014|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082058/http://www.musikindustrie.de/aktuell_einzel/news/neuer-diamond-award-fuer-die-erfolgreichsten-singles-und-alben-in-deutschland/|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as Denmark and Spain, maintain separate awards for digital download singles and streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ifpi.dk/?q=node/11|title=IFPI Denmark: Guld og platin (2014)|year=2014|publisher=[[IFPI]] Denmark|language=Danish|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|title=Listas semanales: 14 July 2014 – 20.7.2014|publisher=[[PROMUSICAE]]|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727040623/http://www.promusicae.es/listas/semanales|archivedate=27 July 2014|date=July 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFPI certification ===
The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) was founded in 1996, and grants the IFPI Platinum Europe Award for album sales over one million within Europe and (as of October 2009) the Middle East. Multi-platinum Europe Awards are presented for sales in subsequent multiples of one million. Eligibility is unaffected by time (from date of release), and is not restricted to European-based artists.

=== IMPALA certification ===
The [[Independent Music Companies Association]] (IMPALA) was founded in 2000 to grow the independent music sector and promote independent music in the interests of artistic, entrepreneurial and cultural diversity. IMPALA sales awards were launched in 2005 as the first sales awards recognising that success on a pan-European basis begins well before sales reach one million. The award levels are Silver (20,000+), Double Silver (40,000+), Gold (75,000+), Double Gold (150,000+), Diamond (200,000+), Platinum (400,000+) and Double Platinum (800,000+).

== Certification thresholds ==
{{Main|List of music recording certifications}}

[[File:Gold Record.jpg|thumb|Boy band [[Plus One (band)|Plus One]] displaying their gold records]]
Below are certification thresholds for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and France. The numbers in the tables are in terms of "units", where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for a single album to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes Platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be "Double-Platinum", or sometimes "Multi-Platinum".

The plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been [[Vacuum metallizing|vacuum metallized]] and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal "masters", "mothers", or "stampers" (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The music in the grooves on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/154422901/ |title=All That Music is Not Gold |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=65 |date=12 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between [[US$]]135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.

'''''My Dog Skip''''' is a memoir by [[Willie Morris]] published by [[Random House]] in 1995.

[[File:My Dog Skip.jpeg|thumb|Cover of movie novelization]]
''My Dog Skip'' is the story  about nine-year-old Willie Morris growing up in [[Yazoo City, Mississippi]], a tale of a boy and his dog in a small, sleepy Southern town that teaches us about family, friendship, love, devotion, trust and bravery. Willie and Skip's relationship goes beyond that of owner and dog, but is a relationship recognized and celebrated by the entire town.

In 2000, the book was made into [[My Dog Skip (film)|a film of the same name]]. Although Skip was a [[Fox Terrier]], a number of [[Jack Russell terrier]]s were used in filming, two of which were [[Moose (dog actor)|Moose]], and Moose's son [[Enzo (dog actor)|Enzo]] who both portrayed Eddie on NBC's sitcom ''[[Frasier]]''.

The original dog in the book, Skip, was actually a Smooth Haired Fox Terrier, and not a Jack Russell portrayed in the movie.

'''Opera''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔːpera|lang}}; English plural: ''operas''; Italian plural: ''opere'' {{IPA-it|ˈɔːpere|}}) is a form of [[theatre]] in which [[music]] has a leading role and the parts are taken by [[Singing|singers]].&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a "work" (the literal translation of "opera") is typically a collaboration between a [[composer]] and a [[libretto|librettist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wagner]] and [[Arrigo Boito]] are notable creators who combined both roles.&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates a number of the [[performing arts]], such as [[acting]], [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[costume]], and sometimes [[dance]] or [[ballet]]. The performance is typically given in an [[opera house]], accompanied by an [[orchestra]] or smaller [[musical ensemble]], which since the early 19th century has been led by a [[conducting|conductor]].

Opera is a key part of the [[Western culture#Music|Western]] [[classical music]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, are also sometimes called "opera" by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, [[Chinese opera]]). These independent traditions are not derivative of Western opera but are rather distinct forms of [[musical theatre]]. Opera is also not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]] featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the [[musical theatre|musical]] have appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include [[:Category:Opera genres|numerous genres]], including some that include spoken dialogue such as [[musical theater]], ''[[Singspiel]]'' and ''[[Opéra comique]]''. In traditional [[number opera]], singers employ two styles of singing: [[recitative]], a speech-inflected style&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"&gt;[[#Apel1969|Apel]], p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-contained [[aria]]s. The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous [[Gesamtkunstwerk|music drama]].

[[Origins of opera|Opera originated]] in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as [[George Frideric Handel]]. [[Opera seria]] was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] reacted against its artificiality with his "reform" operas in the 1760s. The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian [[comic opera]]s, especially ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (''Le nozze di Figaro''), ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', as well as ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (''The Abduction from the Seraglio''), and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (''Die Zauberflöte''), landmarks in the German tradition.

The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the [[bel canto]] style, with [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]] all creating works that are still performed. It also saw the advent of [[Grand Opera]] typified by the works of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]. The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Italy and [[Richard Wagner]] in Germany. The popularity of opera continued through the [[verismo]] era in Italy and contemporary [[French opera]] through to [[Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Richard Strauss]] in the early 20th century. During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in [[Russian opera|Russia]] and [[Bohemia]]. The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as [[atonality]] and [[serialism]] ([[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]), [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]] ([[Igor Stravinsky]]), and [[Minimalism]] ([[Philip Glass]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]). With the rise of [[sound recording|recording technology]], singers such as [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Maria Callas]] became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans. Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these mediums. Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live [[high-definition video]] transmissions of their performances in [[Movie theatre|cinemas]] all over the world. Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are [[Live streaming|live streamed]].

==Operatic terminology==

The words of an opera are known as the [[libretto]] (literally "small book"). Some composers, notably Wagner, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. Mozart with [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. Traditional opera, often referred to as "[[number opera]]", consists of two modes of singing: [[recitative]], the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech,&lt;ref name="Apel, p. 718"/&gt; and [[aria]] (an "air" or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Vocal duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as [[singspiel]], [[opéra comique]], [[operetta]], and [[semi-opera]], the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as [[arioso]]. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail [[#Operatic voices|below]].&lt;ref&gt;General information in this section comes from the relevant articles in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', by. P.Scholes (10th ed., 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; During both the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms, each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble: ''secco'' (dry) recitative, sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accent of the words, accompanied only by ''[[basso continuo]]'', which was usually a [[harpsichord]] and a cello; or ''accompagnato'' (also known as ''strumentato'') in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. Over the 18th century, arias were increasingly accompanied by the orchestra. By the 19th century, ''accompagnato'' had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and Wagner revolutionized opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what Wagner termed "endless melody". Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner's example, though some, such as Stravinsky in his ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' have bucked the trend. The changing role of the orchestra in opera is described in more detail [[#Changing role of the orchestra|below]].

==History==

===Origins===
{{Main article|Origins of opera}}
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claudio Monteverdi]]]]
The Italian word ''opera'' means "work", both in the sense of the labour done and the result produced. The Italian word derives from the Latin ''opera'', a singular noun meaning "work" and also the plural of the noun ''[[:wikt:opus|opus]]''. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the Italian word was first used in the sense "composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd ed., s.v. "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131729 opera]".&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dafne]]'' by [[Jacopo Peri]] was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata de' Bardi]]". Significantly, ''Dafne'' was an attempt to revive the classical [[Tragedy|Greek drama]], part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the [[Renaissance]]. The members of the Camerata considered that the "chorus" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of "restoring" this situation. ''Dafne,'' however, is lost. A later work by Peri, ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'', dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', composed for the court of [[Mantua]] in 1607.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 1; articles on Peri and Monteverdi in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mantua court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]], employers of Monteverdi, played a significant role in the origin of opera employing not only court singers of the [[concerto delle donne]] (till 1598), but also one of the first actual "opera singers"; [[Madama Europa]].&lt;ref&gt;Karin Pendle Women and music 2001 p. 65 "From 1587–1600 a Jewish singer cited only as Madama Europa was in the pay of the Duke of Mantua,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian opera===
{{Main article|Italian opera}}

====Baroque era====
[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Vivaldi]],  in 1723]]
[[File:Ceskystage.jpg|thumb|Private baroque theatre in [[Český Krumlov]]]]
[[File:Pannini, Giovanni Paolo - Musical Fête - 1747.png|thumb|[[Teatro Argentina]] ([[Giovanni Paolo Panini|Panini]], 1747, [[Musée du Louvre]])]]

Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" ([[Carnival]]) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'', for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower [[Francesco Cavalli]] helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the [[Arcadian academy|Arcadian Academy]], which came to be associated with the poet [[Metastasio]], whose [[Libretto|libretti]] helped crystallize the genre of [[opera seria]], which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called [[opera buffa]].
Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera." One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public [[opera house]]s. These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived from the [[commedia dell'arte]], a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of "intermezzi", which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and '20s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.

''Opera seria'' was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of ''secco'' recitative interspersed with long ''da capo'' arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of ''opera seria'' the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the high-pitched male [[castrato]] voice, which was produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], which prevented a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed at puberty. Castrati such as [[Farinelli]] and [[Senesino]], as well as female [[soprano]]s such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], became in great demand throughout Europe as ''opera seria'' ruled the stage in every country except France.  Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] found himself composing the likes of ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' and ''[[Giulio Cesare]]'' for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] as well, for example in the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of [[opera seria]] include [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Nicola Porpora|Porpora]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Opera seria]] had its weaknesses and critics. The taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. [[Francesco Algarotti]]'s ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) proved to be an inspiration for [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s reforms. He advocated that ''opera seria'' had to return to basics and that all the various elements—music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging—must be subservient to the overriding drama. In 1765 [[Melchior Grimm]] published "{{Lang|fr|Poème lyrique}}", an influential article for the [[Encyclopédie]] on [[lyric poetry|lyric]] and opera [[libretto]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/musdico/Grimm/167991 Larousse ''Dictionnaire de la musique'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music and the Origins of Language: Theories from the French Enlightenment|first= Downing A|last= Thomas|page= 148|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zct2C3-jaAC&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die%20Grimm%20article&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0521473071|date= 1995-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgrFMhZy3aAC&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=Lully Studies|first=John Hajdu|last=Heyer|date=7 December 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0521621830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SqdTxG3jUNMC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Encyclop%C3%A9die+Grimm+article&amp;f=false|title=A History of Western Musical Aesthetics|first=Edward A.|last=Lippman|date=26 November 1992|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0803279513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/music/research/proj/esf/pos/sem1.aspx|title=King's College London –  Seminar 1|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers of the period, including [[Niccolò Jommelli]] and [[Tommaso Traetta]], attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to succeed however, was Gluck. Gluck strove to achieve a "beautiful simplicity". This is evident in his first reform opera, ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', where his non-virtuosic vocal melodies are supported by simple harmonies and a richer orchestra presence throughout.

Gluck's reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart, and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck's successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comic operas with libretti by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], notably ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart's contribution to ''opera seria'' was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as ''[[Idomeneo]]'' and ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'', ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989); entries on Gluck and Mozart in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bel canto, Verdi and verismo====
[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi, by [[Giovanni Boldini]], 1886]]
The [[bel canto]] opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]] and many others. Literally "beautiful singing", ''bel canto'' opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control. Examples of famous operas in the bel canto style include Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', as well as Bellini's ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and Donizetti's ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]''.

Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], beginning with his biblical opera ''[[Nabucco]]''. This opera, and the ones that would follow in Verdi's career, revolutionized Italian opera, changing it from merely a display of vocal fireworks, with Rossini's and Donizetti's works, to dramatic story-telling. Verdi's operas resonated with the growing spirit of [[Italian nationalism]] in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement for a unified Italy. In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]''. The first of these, ''Rigoletto'', proved the most daring and revolutionary. In it, Verdi blurs the distinction between the aria and recitative as it never before was, leading the opera to be "an unending string of duets". ''La traviata'' was also novel. It tells the story of courtesan, and is often cited as one of the first "realistic" operas,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} because rather than featuring great kings and figures from literature, it focuses on the tragedies of ordinary life and society. After these, he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French [[Grand Opera]], ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and ending his career with two [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare-inspired]] works, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century. These final two works showed Verdi at his most masterfully orchestrated, and are both incredibly influential, and modern. In ''Falstaff'', Verdi sets the preeminent standard for the form and style that would dominate opera throughout the twentieth century. Rather than long, suspended melodies, ''Falstaff'' contains many little motifs and mottos, that, rather than being expanded upon, are introduced and subsequently dropped, only to be brought up again later. These motifs never are expanded upon, and just as the audience expects a character to launch into a long melody, a new character speaks, introducing a new phrase. This fashion of opera directed opera from Verdi, onward, exercising tremendous influence on his successors [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Benjamin Britten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardstrauss.at/strauss-and-wagner.html|title=Strauss and Wagner – Various articles – Richard Strauss|website=www.richardstrauss.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Verdi, the sentimental "realistic" melodrama of [[verismo]] appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' that came to dominate the world's opera stages with such popular works as [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Later Italian composers, such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono|Nono]], have experimented with [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 5, 8 and 9.

===German-language opera===
{{Main article|German opera}}
[[File:Karl Friedrich Schinkel Die Sternenhalle der Königin der Nacht Bühnenbild Zauberflöte Mozart.tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Queen of the Night in an 1815 production of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'']]
The first German opera was ''[[Dafne (Opitz-Schütz)|Dafne]]'', composed by [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1627, but the music score has not survived. Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms would develop in spite of this influence. In 1644, [[Sigmund Theophil Staden|Sigmund Staden]] produced the first ''[[Singspiel]]'', ''[[Seelewig]]'', a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th century and early 18th century, the Theater am Gänsemarkt in [[Hamburg]] presented German operas by [[Reinhard Keiser|Keiser]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]. Yet most of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as [[Carl Heinrich Graun|Graun]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse|Hasse]] and later [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian. In contrast to Italian opera, which was generally composed for the aristocratic class, German opera was generally composed for the masses and tended to feature simple folk-like melodies, and it was not until the arrival of Mozart that German opera was able to match its Italian counterpart in musical sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Music: the Classical Era'' ed. [[Neal Zaslaw]] (Macmillan, 1989), pp. 242–47, 258–60;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' pp. 58–63, 98–103. Articles on Hasse, Graun and Hiller in ''Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RichardWagner.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Richard Wagner]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Singspiele'', ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (1782) and ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] with his ''[[Fidelio]]'', inspired by the climate of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] established [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian [[bel canto]]. His ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' (1821) shows his genius for creating a supernatural atmosphere. Other opera composers of the time include [[Heinrich Marschner|Marschner]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Albert Lortzing|Lortzing]], but the most significant figure was undoubtedly [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].
[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 180.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Brünnhilde throws herself on Siegfried's funeral pyre in Wagner's ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'']]
Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' (a "complete work of art"), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of [[leitmotif]]s, recurring [[Theme (music)|themes]] often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama, of which prototypes can be heard in his earlier operas such as ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|Der fliegende Holländer]]'', ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as [[tonality]], in his quest for greater expressivity. In his mature music dramas, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'', ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]'', he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of "endless melody". Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] or [[Arthurian]] legend. Finally, Wagner built [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|his own opera house]] at [[Bayreuth]] with part of the patronage from [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.

Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, [[Richard Strauss]] accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions, along with incorporating the new form introduced by Verdi. He first won fame with the scandalous ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and the dark tragedy ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', where Mozart and Viennese [[waltz]]es became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Erich Korngold]], [[Franz Schreker]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Kurt Weill]] and the Italian-born [[Ferruccio Busoni]]. The operatic innovations of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his successors are discussed in the section on [[#Modernism|modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–3, 6, 8 and 9, and ''The Oxford Companion to Music''; more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century, the Austrian composer [[Johann Strauss II]], an admirer of the [[French language|French]]-language [[operetta]]s composed by [[Jacques Offenbach]], composed several German-language operettas, the most famous of which was ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', which is still regularly performed today.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/operetta.htm A History of The Musical: European Operetta 1850–1880]. Musicals101.com&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, rather than copying the style of Offenbach, the operettas of Strauss II had distinctly [[Vienna|Viennese]] flavor to them, which have cemented the Strauss II's place as one of the most renowned operetta composers of all time.

In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] at the court of [[King Louis XIV]]. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an [[Académie Royale de Musique|Academy of Music]] and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', Lully and his librettist [[Philippe Quinault|Quinault]] created ''[[tragédie en musique]]'', a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully's operas also show a concern for expressive [[recitative]] which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully's most important successor was [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], who composed five ''[[tragédie en musique|tragédies en musique]]'' as well as numerous works in other genres such as [[opéra-ballet]], all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. Despite the popularity of Italian [[opera seria]] throughout much of Europe during the Baroque period, Italian opera never gained much of a foothold in France, where its own national operatic tradition was more popular instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_b2vIXHsUkC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;dq=Italian+opera+not+popular+in+france#v=onepage&amp;q=Italian%20opera%20not%20popular%20in%20france&amp;f=false |title=A Short History of Opera |isbn=978-0231119580 |accessdate=11 April 2014|last1=Grout |first1=Donald Jay |last2=Grout |first2=Donald |last3=Williams |first3=Hermine Weigel |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rameau's death, the German [[Gluck]] was persuaded to produce six operas for the [[Paris|Parisian stage]] in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: ''[[opéra comique]]''. This was the equivalent of the German [[singspiel]], where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]], [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and, above all, [[André Grétry|Grétry]]. During the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] period, composers such as [[Méhul]] and [[Cherubini]], who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly "comic" in any case. Another phenomenon of this period was the 'propaganda opera' celebrating revolutionary successes, e.g. [[François Joseph Gossec|Gossec's]] ''Le triomphe de la République'' (1793).
[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2012 - Carmen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Magdalena Kožená]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]] in a scene from ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Salzburg Festival]] 2012]]

By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian [[bel canto]], especially after the arrival of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] in Paris. Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' helped found the new genre of [[Grand Opera]], a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]. Meyerbeer's works, such as ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter ''opéra comique'' also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of [[Boïeldieu]], [[Daniel Auber|Auber]], [[Ferdinand Hérold|Hérold]] and [[Adolphe Adam|Adam]]. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer [[Hector Berlioz]] struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece ''[[Les Troyens]]'', the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.

In the second half of the 19th century, [[Jacques Offenbach]] created [[operetta]] with witty and cynical works such as ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', as well as the opera ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''; [[Charles Gounod]] scored a massive success with ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''; and [[Georges Bizet]] composed ''[[Carmen]]'', which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of [[Romanticism]] and realism, became the most popular of all opéra comiques. [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Léo Delibes]] all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory, examples being Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Saint-Saëns' ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson et Dalila]]'' and Delibes' ''[[Lakmé]]''.  Their operas formed another genre, the Opera Lyrique, combined opera comique and grand opera. It is less grandiose than grand opera, but without the spoken dialogue of opera comique.  At the same time, the influence of [[Richard Wagner]] was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner's music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from [[Claude Debussy]]. As in Wagner's works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy's unique opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely un-Wagnerian.

Other notable 20th-century names include [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]], [[Albert Roussel|Roussel]] and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]. [[Francis Poulenc]] is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'') have gained a foothold in the international repertory. [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s lengthy sacred drama ''[[Saint François d'Assise]]'' (1983) has also attracted widespread attention.&lt;ref&gt;General outline for this section from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1–4, 8 and 9; and ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (10th ed., 1968); more specific references from the individual composer entries in ''The Viking Opera Guide''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, opera's antecedent was the 17th-century ''jig''. This was an afterpiece which came at the end of a play. It was frequently [[libel]]lous and scandalous and consisted in the main of dialogue set to music arranged from popular tunes. In this respect, jigs anticipate the ballad operas of the 18th century. At the same time, the French [[masque]] was gaining a firm hold at the English Court, with even more lavish splendour and highly realistic scenery than had been seen before. [[Inigo Jones]] became the quintessential designer of these productions, and this style was to dominate the English stage for three centuries. These masques contained songs and dances. In [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''Lovers Made Men'' (1617), "the whole masque was sung after the Italian manner, stilo recitativo".&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite&gt;[http://www.webrarian.co.uk/ivanhoe/ivan01.html From Webrarian.com's] ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' site.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the [[English Commonwealth]] closed theatres and halted any developments that may have led to the establishment of English opera. However, in 1656, the [[dramatist]] Sir [[William Davenant]] produced ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]''. Since his theatre was not licensed to produce drama, he asked several of the leading composers (Lawes, Cooke, Locke, Coleman and Hudson) to set sections of it to music. This success was followed by ''[[The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru]]'' (1658) and ''[[The History of Sir Francis Drake]]'' (1659). These pieces were encouraged by [[Oliver Cromwell]] because they were critical of Spain. With the [[English Restoration]], foreign (especially French) musicians were welcomed back. In 1673, [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'', patterned on the 1671 'comédie-ballet' of the same name produced by [[Molière]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. [[William Davenant]] produced ''The Tempest'' in the same year, which was the first musical adaption of a [[Shakespeare]] play (composed by Locke and Johnson).&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; About 1683, [[John Blow]] composed ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]'', often thought of as the first true English-language opera.

Blow's immediate successor was the better known [[Henry Purcell]]. Despite the success of his masterwork ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' (1689), in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell's best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera, but instead, he usually worked within the constraints of the [[semi-opera]] format, where isolated scenes and masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play, such as [[Shakespeare]] in Purcell's ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'' (1692) and Beaumont and Fletcher in ''The Prophetess'' (1690) and ''Bonduca'' (1696). The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator [[John Dryden]]) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell's early death at the age of 36.

[[File:Thomas Augustine Arne.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Thomas Arne]]]]
Following Purcell, the popularity of opera in England dwindled for several decades. A revived interest in opera occurred in the 1730s which is largely attributed to [[Thomas Arne]], both for his own compositions and for alerting Handel to the commercial possibilities of large-scale works in English. Arne was the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, with his greatest success being ''[[Thomas and Sally]]'' in 1760. His opera ''[[Artaxerxes (opera)|Artaxerxes]]'' (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown [[opera seria]] in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Although Arne imitated many elements of Italian opera, he was perhaps the only English composer at that time who was able to move beyond the Italian influences and create his own unique and distinctly English voice. His modernized ballad opera, ''Love in a Village'' (1762), began a vogue for pastiche opera that lasted well into the 19th century. [[Charles Burney]] wrote that Arne introduced "a light, airy, original, and pleasing melody, wholly different from that of Purcell or Handel, whom all English composers had either pillaged or imitated".
[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Mikado]]'' (Lithograph)]]
Besides Arne, the other dominating force in English opera at this time was [[George Frideric Handel]], whose ''opera serias'' filled the London operatic stages for decades and influenced most home-grown composers, like [[John Frederick Lampe]], who wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including in the work of [[Michael William Balfe]], and the operas of the great Italian composers, as well as those of Mozart, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, continued to dominate the musical stage in England.

The only exceptions were [[ballad opera]]s, such as [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], European [[operetta]]s, and late [[Victorian era]] [[light opera]]s, notably the [[Savoy Operas]] of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], all of which types of musical entertainments frequently spoofed operatic conventions. Sullivan wrote only one grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (following the efforts of a number of young English composers beginning about 1876),&lt;ref name=IvanhoeSite /&gt; but he claimed that even his light operas constituted part of a school of "English" opera, intended to supplant the French operettas (usually performed in bad translations) that had dominated the London stage from the mid-19th century into the 1870s. London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' agreed, describing ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' as "a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s review of ''Yeomen'' stated, "The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly. ...we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." (quoted at p. 312 in Allen, Reginald (1975). ''The First Night Gilbert and Sullivan''. London: Chappell &amp; Co. Ltd.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan produced a few light operas in the 1890s that were of a more serious nature than those in the G&amp;S series, including ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' and ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', but ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (which ran for 155 consecutive performances, using alternating casts—a record until Broadway's ''[[La bohème]]'') survives as his only [[Grand Opera]].

In the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence, with works of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and in particular [[Benjamin Britten]], who in a series of works that remain in standard repertory today, revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. More recently [[Harrison Birtwistle|Sir Harrison Birtwistle]] has emerged as one of Britain's most significant contemporary composers from his first opera ''[[Punch and Judy (opera)|Punch and Judy]]'' to his most recent critical success in [[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, the librettist of an early Birtwistle opera, [[Michael Nyman]], has been focusing on composing operas, including ''[[Facing Goya]]'', ''[[Man and Boy: Dada]]'', and ''[[Love Counts]]''. Today composers such as [[Thomas Adès]] continue to export English opera abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 1, 3 and 9. ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Blow, Purcell and Britten.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 20th century, American composers like [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gian Carlo Menotti]], [[Douglas Moore]], and [[Carlisle Floyd]] began to contribute English-language operas infused with touches of popular musical styles. They were followed by composers such as [[Philip Glass]], [[Mark Adamo]], [[John Corigliano]], [[Robert Moran]], [[John Coolidge Adams]], [[André Previn]] and [[Jake Heggie]].

===Russian opera===
{{Main article|Russian opera}}
[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Feodor Chaliapin]] as [[Ivan Susanin]] in [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]
Opera was brought to Russia in the 1730s by the [[Italian opera]]tic [[wikt:troupe|troupes]] and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian Imperial Court and [[aristocracy]]. Many foreign composers such as [[Baldassare Galuppi]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]], and [[Domenico Cimarosa]] (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the [[Italian language]]. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like [[Maksym Berezovsky]] and [[Dmitry Bortniansky]] were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in Russian was ''[[Tsefal i Prokris]]'' by the Italian composer [[Francesco Araja]] (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers [[Vasily Pashkevich]], [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Alexey Verstovsky]].

However, the real birth of [[Russian opera]] came with [[Mikhail Glinka]] and his two great operas ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' (1836) and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842). After him, in the 19th century in Russia, there were written such operatic masterpieces as ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'' by [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], ''[[Prince Igor]]'' by [[Alexander Borodin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Pyotr Tchaikovsky]], and ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian [[nationalism]] across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general [[Slavophilism]] movement.

In the 20th century, the [[tradition]]s of Russian opera were developed by many composers including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in his works ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'', [[Igor Stravinsky]] in ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]'', ''[[Mavra]]'', ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', and ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in ''[[The Gambler (Prokofiev)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'', ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]'', ''[[Betrothal in a Monastery]]'', and ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]''; as well as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in ''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'' and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', [[Edison Denisov]] in ''[[L'écume des jours (opera)|L'écume des jours]]'', and [[Alfred Schnittke]] in ''[[Life with an Idiot]]'' and ''[[Historia von D. Johann Fausten (opera)|Historia von D. Johann Fausten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard: Russia in 'The New Grove Dictionary of Opera', ed. Stanley Sadie (London, 1992); ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapters 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other national operas===
[[File:Prodana Nevesta Cover 1919.JPG|thumb|Score of Smetana's ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'']]
Spain also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as [[zarzuela]], which had two separate flowerings: one from the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, and another beginning around 1850. During the late 18th century up until the mid-19th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.

Czech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with [[Bedřich Smetana]], who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. [[Antonín Dvořák]], most famous for ''[[Rusalka (opera)|Rusalka]]'', wrote 13 operas; and [[Leoš Janáček]] gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including ''[[Jenůfa]]'', ''[[The Cunning Little Vixen]]'', and ''[[Káťa Kabanová]]''.

In Russian Eastern Europe, several national operas began to emerge. Ukrainian opera was developed by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]] (1813–1873) whose most famous work ''[[Zaporozhets za Dunayem]]'' (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) is regularly performed around the world. Other Ukrainian opera composers include [[Mykola Lysenko]] (''[[Taras Bulba (opera)|Taras Bulba]]'' and ''[[Natalka Poltavka (opera)|Natalka Poltavka]]''), [[Heorhiy Maiboroda]], and [[Yuliy Meitus]]. At the turn of the century, a distinct national opera movement also began to emerge in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] under the leadership [[Zacharia Paliashvili]], who fused local [[folk song]]s and stories with 19th-century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] classical themes.

[[File:Erkel Ferenc Györgyi Alajos.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ferenc Erkel]], the father of Hungarian opera]]
The key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was [[Ferenc Erkel]], whose works mostly dealt with historical themes. Among his most often performed operas are ''[[Hunyadi László (opera)|Hunyadi László]]'' and ''[[Bánk bán]]''. The most famous modern Hungarian opera is [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''.

[[Stanisław Moniuszko]]'s opera ''[[The Haunted Manor|Straszny Dwór]]'' (in English ''The Haunted Manor'') (1861–64) represents a nineteenth-century peak of [[Polish opera|Polish national opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See the chapter on "Russian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian Opera to 1900" by John Tyrrell in ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, other operas created by Polish composers included ''[[King Roger]]'' by [[Karol Szymanowski]] and ''[[Ubu Rex]]'' by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].

The first known opera from [[Turkey]] (the [[Ottoman Empire]]) was ''[[Arshak II (opera)|Arshak II]]'', which was an Armenian opera composed by an ethnic Armenian composer [[Tigran Tchoukhajian]] in 1868 and partially performed in 1873. It was fully staged in 1945 in Armenia.

The first years of the [[Soviet Union]] saw the emergence of new national operas, such as the ''[[Koroğlu (opera)|Koroğlu]]'' (1937) by the [[Azerbaijan]]i composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]]. The first [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] opera, ''Ai-Churek'', premiered in Moscow at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on 26 May 1939, during Kyrgyz Art Decade. It was composed by [[Vladimir Vlasov]], [[Abdylas Maldybaev]] and [[Vladimir Fere]]. The libretto was written by Joomart Bokonbaev, Jusup Turusbekov, and Kybanychbek Malikov.

In Latin America, opera started as a result of European colonisation. The first opera ever written in the Americas was ''[[La púrpura de la rosa]]'', by [[Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco]], although ''[[Partenope (Zumaya)|Partenope]]'', by the Mexican [[Manuel de Zumaya]], was the first opera written from a composer born in Latin America (music now lost). The first Brazilian opera for a libretto in Portuguese was ''A Noite de São João'', by [[Elias Álvares Lobo]]. However, [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] is generally regarded as the most outstanding Brazilian composer, having a relative success in Italy with its Brazilian-themed operas with Italian librettos, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]''. Opera in Argentina developed in the 20th century after the inauguration of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires—with the opera ''[[Aurora (opera)|Aurora]]'', by [[Ettore Panizza]], being heavily influenced by the Italian tradition, due to immigration. Other important composers from Argentina include [[Felipe Boero]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]].

===Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends===

====Modernism====
Perhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of [[atonality]]. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with [[Richard Wagner]], and in particular the [[Tristan chord]]. Composers such as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Giacomo Puccini]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, [[Paul Hindemith]], Benjamin Britten and [[Hans Pfitzner]] pushed Wagnerian harmony further with a more extreme use of chromaticism and greater use of dissonance. Another aspect of modernist opera is the shift away from long, suspended melodies, to short quick mottos, as first illustrated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in his ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''. Composers such as Strauss, Britten, Shostakovich and Stravinsky adopted and expanded upon this style.

[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Schönberg . 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arnold Schoenberg in 1917; portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
Operatic modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and his student [[Alban Berg]], both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), [[dodecaphony]]. Schoenberg's early musico-dramatic works, ''[[Erwartung]]'' (1909, premiered in 1924) and ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'' display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used [[Sprechstimme]].

The two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1925) and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (incomplete at his death in 1935) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.
[[File:Igor Stravinsky Essays.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky in 1921]]
Composers thus influenced include the Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]], the German [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. ([[Philip Glass]] also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]], usually thought of as another 20th-century development.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/modern/minimalism-guide/|title=Minimalist music: where to start|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Most readers will find it startling to hear Glass associated with atonality.--&gt;

However, operatic modernism's use of atonality also sparked a backlash in the form of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. An early leader of this movement was [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical [[number opera]] ''[[Arlecchino (opera)|Arlecchino]]'' (first performed in 1917).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Walton, "Neo-classical opera" in [[#Cooke2005|Cooke]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the vanguard was the Russian [[Igor Stravinsky]]. After composing music for the [[Diaghilev]]-produced ballets ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927).  Stravinsky had already turned away from the modernist trends of his early ballets to produce small-scale works that do not fully qualify as opera, yet certainly contain many operatic elements, including ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (1916: "a burlesque in song and dance") and ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'' (1918: "to be read, played, and danced"; in both cases the descriptions and instructions are those of the composer). In the latter, the actors declaim portions of speech to a specified rhythm over instrumental accompaniment, peculiarly similar to the older German genre of ''[[Melodrama]]''.  Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (1914), and ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore [[serialism|serialist technique]] and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style [[diatonic]] number opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many{{who|date=October 2012}}&lt;!-- if references had a page number it might be possible to replace weaslely phrase with a concrete example --&gt; other composers.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 8; ''The Viking Opera Guide'' articles on Schoenberg, Berg and Stravinsky; Malcolm MacDonald ''Schoenberg'' (Dent,1976); Francis Routh, ''Stravinsky'' (Dent, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other trends====
A common trend throughout the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the use of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased throughout the 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; [[Mark Adamo]]'s two-act realization of ''[[Little Women (opera)|Little Women]]'' is scored for 18 instrumentalists.

Another feature of late 20th-century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'', ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]'', and ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], ''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'' by [[Jake Heggie]], and ''[[Anna Nicole]]'' by [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]] exemplify the dramatisation onstage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance.

The Metropolitan Opera in the US reports that the average age of its audience is now 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/met-backtracks-on-drop-in-average-audience-age/ | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel J. | last=Wakin | title=Met Backtracks on Drop in Average Audience Age | date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for [[classical music]] since the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: ''Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'', Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/about/education/student.aspx |title=Information about Metropolitan Opera Company student discounts |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller companies in the US have a more fragile existence, and they usually depend on a "patchwork quilt" of support from state and local governments, local businesses, and fundraisers. Nevertheless, some smaller companies have found ways of drawing new audiences. [[Opera Carolina]] offer discounts and happy hour events to the 21- to 40-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ Opera Carolina discount information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221220758/http://www.operayoungprofessionals.org/ |date=21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to radio and television broadcasts of opera performances, which have had some success in gaining new audiences, broadcasts of live performances in HD to movie theatres have shown the potential to reach new audiences. Since 2006, the Met has broadcast live performances to several hundred movie screens all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/broadcast/hd_events_alternates.aspx|title = On Air &amp; On Line: 2007–08 HD Season|accessdate = 10 April 2008|year = 2007|publisher = The Metropolitan Opera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From musicals back towards opera====
By the late 1930s, some [[musical theatre|musicals]] began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935), influenced by jazz styles, and ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' (1956), with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. Popular [[Musical theatre|musicals]] such as ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and in the 2010s they are sometimes seen in opera houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/17/classicalmusicandopera1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Clements | title=Sweeney Todd, Royal Opera House, London | date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' (1952) is quasi-operatic and has been revived by the [[New York City Opera]]. Other [[rock musical|rock influenced musicals]], such as ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1971), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), and ''[[Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) employ various operatic conventions, such as [[through composed|through composition]], recitative instead of dialogue, and [[leitmotif]]s.

===Acoustic enhancement in opera===
A subtle type of sound electronic reinforcement called [[acoustic enhancement]] is used in some modern concert halls and theatres where operas are performed. Although none of the major opera houses "...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre", many use a [[sound reinforcement system]] for acoustic enhancement and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, child singers, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in ''[[Tosca]]'' or thunder effects in Wagnerian operas).&lt;ref&gt;Kai Harada, [http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 "Opera's Dirty Little Secret"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031082324/http://industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?releaseid=5643&amp;magazinearticleid=66853&amp;siteid=15&amp;magazineid=138 |date=31 October 2013 }}, ''Entertainment Design'', 1 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operatic voices==
Operatic vocal technique evolved, in a time before electronic amplification, to allow singers to produce enough volume to be heard over an orchestra, without the instrumentalists having to substantially compromise their volume.

===Vocal classifications===
Singers and the roles they play are classified by [[voice type]], based on the [[tessitura]], [[vocal weight|agility, power]] and [[timbre]] of their voices. Male singers can be classified by [[vocal range]] as [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[bass-baritone]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]], and female singers as [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]]. (Men sometimes sing in the "female" vocal ranges, in which case they are termed [[sopranist]] or [[countertenor]]. The [[countertenor]] is commonly encountered in opera, sometimes singing parts written for [[castrati]]—men neutered at a young age specifically to give them a higher singing range.) Singers are then further classified by [[vocal weight|size]]—for instance, a soprano can be described as a lyric soprano, [[coloratura]], [[soubrette]], [[spinto]], or dramatic soprano. These terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer's voice with the roles most suitable to the singer's vocal characteristics.

Yet another sub-classification can be made according to acting skills or requirements, for example the ''[[Basso Buffo]]'' who often must be a specialist in [[Patter song|patter]] as well as a comic actor. This is carried out in detail in the ''[[Fach]]'' system of German speaking countries, where historically opera and spoken [[drama]] were often put on by the same [[repertory]] company.

A particular singer's voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age. Two French voice types, ''premiere dugazon'' and ''deuxieme dugazon'', were named after successive stages in the career of [[Louise-Rosalie Lefebvre]] (Mme. Dugazon). Other terms originating in the star casting system of the [[Paris Opera#See also|Parisian theatres]] are ''[[Jean-Blaise Martin|baryton-martin]]'' and [[soprano]] ''[[Cornélie Falcon|falcon]]''.

===Historical use of voice parts===
:''The following is only intended as a brief overview. For the main articles, see [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[countertenor]] and [[castrato]]''.

The soprano voice has typically been used as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera since the latter half of the 18th century. Earlier, it was common for that part to be sung by any female voice, or even a [[castrato]]. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high [[A (musical note)|A]] ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], for example, only wrote one role extending to a high [[C (musical note)|C]]), though the castrato [[Farinelli]] was alleged to possess a top [[D (musical note)|D]] (his lower range was also extraordinary, extending to tenor C). The mezzo-soprano, a term of comparatively recent origin, also has a large repertoire, ranging from the female lead in Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' to such heavyweight roles as Brangäne in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' (these are both roles sometimes sung by sopranos; there is quite a lot of movement between these two voice-types). For the true contralto, the range of parts is more limited, which has given rise to the insider joke that contraltos only sing "witches, bitches, and [[breeches role|britches]]" roles. In recent years many of the "trouser roles" from the Baroque era, originally written for women, and those originally sung by castrati, have been reassigned to countertenors.

The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the ''bel canto'' era, such as [[Donizetti]]'s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal heft for his protagonist roles, with this vocal category described as ''Heldentenor''; this heroic voice had its more Italianate counterpart in such roles as Calaf in Puccini's ''Turandot''. Basses have a long history in opera, having been used in ''opera seria'' in supporting roles, and sometimes for comic relief (as well as providing a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the comedy of Leporello in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' to the nobility of Wotan in [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Wagner's ''Ring Cycle,'']] to the conflicted King Phillip of Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]''. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone, which also varies in weight from say, Guglielmo in Mozart's ''Così fan tutte'' to Posa in Verdi's ''Don Carlos''; the actual designation "baritone" was not standard until the mid-19th century.

===Famous singers===
[[File:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|upright|The castrato [[Senesino]], c. 1720]]
Early performances of opera were too infrequent for singers to make a living exclusively from the style, but with the birth of commercial opera in the mid-17th century, professional performers began to emerge. The role of the male hero was usually entrusted to a [[castrato]], and by the 18th century, when Italian opera was performed throughout Europe, leading castrati who possessed extraordinary vocal virtuosity, such as [[Senesino]] and [[Farinelli]], became international stars. The career of the first major female star (or [[prima donna]]), [[Anna Renzi]], dates to the mid-17th century. In the 18th century, a number of Italian sopranos gained international renown and often engaged in fierce rivalry, as was the case with [[Faustina Bordoni]] and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]], who started a fist fight with one another during a performance of a Handel opera. The French disliked castrati, preferring their male heroes to be sung by an [[haute-contre]] (a high tenor), of which [[Joseph Legros]] (1739–1793) was a leading example.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera'' (ed. Parker, 1994), Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;

Though opera patronage has decreased in the last century in favor of other arts and media (such as musicals, cinema, radio, television and recordings), mass media and the advent of recording have supported the popularity of many famous singers including [[Maria Callas]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Amelita Galli-Curci]], [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Juan Arvizu]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mexican+musicians+in+California+and+the+United+States%2C+1910-50.-a0155283831 ''The Free Library – Mexican Musicians in California and the United States 1910–50 – Two Mexican Tenors'' – Juan Arvizu opera tenor in thefreelibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lzmTAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:sZtJSSJbdm4C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9sOe62dXZAhXPct8KHYJeCmcQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Juan%20Arvizu&amp;f=false ''Agustin Lara: A Cultural Biography'' – "Juan Arvizu Biography" – operatic tenor] Andrew Grant Wood.

==Changing role of the orchestra==
Before the 1700s, Italian operas used a small [[string orchestra]], but it rarely played to accompany the singers. Opera solos during this period were accompanied by the [[basso continuo]] group, which consisted of the [[harpsichord]], "plucked instruments" such as [[lute]] and a bass instrument.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"&gt;John Spitzer. (2009). Orchestra and voice in eighteenth-century Italian opera. In: Anthony R. DelDonna and Pierpaolo Polzonetti (eds.) [[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Eighteenth-Century Opera]]. pp. 112–39. [Online]. Cambridge Companions to Music. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The string orchestra typically only played when the singer was not singing, such as during a singer's "...entrances and exits, between vocal numbers, [or] for [accompanying] dancing". Another role for the orchestra during this period was playing an orchestral [[ritornello]] to mark the end of a singer's solo.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt; During the early 1700s, some composers began to use the string orchestra to mark certain aria or recitatives "...as special"; by 1720, most arias were accompanied by orchestra. Opera composers such as [[Domenico Sarro]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Giambattista Pergolesi]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Johann Adolf Hasse]] added new instruments to the opera orchestra and gave the instruments new roles. They added wind instruments to the strings and used orchestral instruments to play instrumental solos, as a way to mark certain arias as special.&lt;ref name="John Spitzer 2009 pp. 112-139"/&gt;
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006329 030 Orchester im Orchestergraben.jpg|thumb|right|German opera orchestra from the early 1950s]]
The orchestra has also provided an instrumental [[overture]] before the singers come onstage since the 1600s. [[Jacopo Peri|Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' opens with a brief instrumental [[ritornello]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) opens with a [[toccata]], in this case a fanfare for muted [[trumpet]]s. The [[French overture]] as found in [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s operas&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, George Gow, and James R. Anthony. 2001. "French Overture". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; consist of a slow introduction in a marked "dotted rhythm", followed by a lively movement in [[fugato]] style. The overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose. This overture style was also used in English opera, most notably in [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] also uses the French overture form in some of his Italian operas such as [[Giulio Cesare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8fHja-D-FvsC&amp;dq=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture&amp;q=Giulio+Cesare+French+overture#v=snippet&amp;q=Giulio%20Cesare%20French%20overture&amp;f=false |last= Burrows |first = Donald|date = 2012|page = 178|title = Handel|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0199737369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, a distinct form called "overture" arose in the 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 2001. "Italian Overture." ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses three generally [[homophony|homophonic]] [[Movement (music)|movements]]: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and could be in a contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the [[gigue]] or [[minuet]], and returned to the key of the opening section. As the form evolved, the first movement may incorporate fanfare-like elements and took on the pattern of so-called "sonatina form" ([[sonata form]] without a development section), and the slow section became more extended and lyrical.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2001"/&gt;

In Italian opera after about 1800, the "overture" became known as the ''sinfonia''.&lt;ref name=FISH&gt;Fisher, Stephen C. 1998. "Sinfonia". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', four volumes, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]]. London: Macmillan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0333734327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also notes the term ''Sinfonia avanti l'opera'' (literally, the "symphony before the opera") was "an early term for a sinfonia used to begin an opera, that is, as an overture as opposed to one serving to begin a later section of the work".&lt;ref name=FISH/&gt; In 19th-century opera, in some operas, the overture, ''Vorspiel'', ''Einleitung'', Introduction, or whatever else it may be called, was the portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises; a specific, rigid form was no longer required for the overture.

The role of the orchestra in accompanying the singers changed over the 19th century, as the Classical style transitioned to the Romantic era. In general, orchestras got bigger, new instruments were added, such as additional percussion instruments (e.g., bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, etc.). The [[orchestration]] of orchestra parts also developed over the 19th century. In Wagnerian operas, the forefronting of the orchestra went beyond the overture. In Wagnerian operas such as ''[[Tristan]]'', the orchestra often played the recurrent musical themes or [[leitmotif]]s, a role which gave a prominence to the orchestra which "...elevated its status to that of a [[prima donna]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Christopher John |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era |url= |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |page=772 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's operas were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity, adding more brass instruments and huge ensemble sizes: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s.

As the role of the orchestra and other instrumental ensembles changed over the history of opera, so did the role of leading the musicians. In the Baroque era, the musicians were usually directed by the harpsichord player, although the French composer Lully is known to have conducted with a long staff. In the 1800s, during the Classical period, the first violinist, also known as the [[concertmaster]], would lead the orchestra while sitting. Over time, some directors began to stand up and use hand and arm gestures to lead the performers. Eventually this role of [[music director]] became termed the [[conducting|conductor]], and a podium was used to make it easier for all the musicians to see him or her. By the time Wagnerian operas were introduced, the complexity of the works and the huge orchestras used to play them gave the conductor an increasingly important role. Modern opera conductors have a challenging role: they have to direct both the orchestra in the [[orchestra pit]] and the singers up on stage.

==Language and translation issues==
Since the days of Handel and Mozart, many composers have favored Italian as the language for the libretto of their operas. From the Bel Canto era to Verdi, composers would sometimes supervise versions of their operas in both Italian and French. Because of this, operas such as ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or ''[[Don Carlos]]'' are today deemed canonical in both their French and Italian versions.&lt;ref&gt;de Acha, Rafael. [http://seenandheard-international.com/2013/09/don-carlos-in-french/ "Don Carlo or Don Carlos? In Italian or in French?"] (Seen and Heard International, 24 September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the mid 1950s, it was acceptable to produce operas in translations even if these had not been authorized by the composer or the original librettists. For example, opera houses in Italy routinely staged Wagner in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/whose-language-is-opera-the-audiences-or-the-composers/news-story/b8b5ea7dfc230f1eda72a2eb329d1daa|title=Whose language is opera: the audience's or the composer's?|author=[[Lyndon Terracini]]|date=11 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII, opera scholarship improved, artists refocused on the original versions, and translations fell out of favor. Knowledge of European languages, especially Italian, French, and German, is today an important part of the training for professional singers."The biggest chunk of operatic training is in linguistics and musicianship," explains mezzo-soprano [[Dolora Zajick]]. "[I have to understand] not only what I'm singing, but what everyone else is singing. I sing Italian, Czech, Russian, French, German, English."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/03/19/291410969/dolora-zajick-singing-is-connected-to-the-body "For Opera Powerhouse Dolora Zajick, 'Singing Is Connected To The Body'"] (Fresh Air, 19 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called [[surtitles]]) began to appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally condemned as a distraction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/arts/music/06tomm.html "So That's What the Fat Lady Sang"] (''The New York Times'', 6 July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium]] arch, or individual seat screens where spectators can choose from more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a [[RAI]] broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.

Today, operas are only rarely performed in translation.

A milestone for opera broadcasting in the U.S. was achieved on December 24, 1951, with the live broadcast of ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'', an opera in one act by [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in America.&lt;ref name=Telegraphobit&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2007/02/02/db0201.xml Obituary: Gian Carlo Menotti], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 February 2007. Accessed 11 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another milestone occurred in Italy in 1992 when ''[[Tosca]]'' was broadcast live from its original Roman settings and times of the day:  The first act came from the 16th-century Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon on Saturday; the 16th-century Palazzo Farnese was the setting for the second at 8:15 P.M.; and on Sunday at 6 A.M., the third act was broadcast from Castel Sant'Angelo.

Major opera companies have begun presenting their performances in local cinemas throughout the United States and many other countries.

The emergence of the Internet has also affected the way in which audiences consume opera. In 2009 the British [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] offered for the first time an online digital video download of its complete 2007 production of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Puppy pregnancy syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] illness in humans brought on by [[mass hysteria]].

The syndrome is thought to be localized to villages in several states of [[India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], and [[Chhattisgarh]], and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Medicine challenges Indian superstition | newspaper = Deutsche Welle World | date = December 31, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|first=Shaikh Azizur |last=Rahman|url=http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

People suffering from this condition believe that shortly after being bitten by a dog, puppies are conceived within their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt; This is said to be especially likely if [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|the dog is sexually excited]] at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name="Scientific"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bering | first = Jesse | title = Puppy Pregnancy Syndrome: Men Who Think They Are Pregnant with Dogs | publisher = Scientific American | date = November 15, 2011  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2011/11/15/puppy-pregnancy-syndrome-men-who-are-pregnant-with-dogs/ | accessdate = March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are said to bark like dogs, and have reported being able to see the puppies inside them when looking at water, or hear them growling in their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite news | last = Achin | first = Kurt | title = Bizarre Medical Myth Persists In Rural India | newspaper =Voice of America | date = March 26, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bizarre-medical-myth-persists-in-rural-india-143818636/179310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the victims will eventually die – especially men, who will give birth to their puppies through the penis.&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

[[Witch doctors]] offer oral cures, which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient".&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-[[rabies]] medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt; This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

Some psychiatrists believe that the syndrome meets the criteria for a [[Culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound disorder]].&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

'''Sarah Bernhardt''' ({{IPA-fr|saʁa bɛʁnɑʁt|lang}};&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{YouTube|FWGjd39dPg8|Her own pronunciation, listen e.g. to}}&lt;/ref&gt; born '''Henriette-Rosine Bernard''', 22 or 23 October 1844 – 26 March 1923) was a [[French people|French]] [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] actress who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including ''[[La Dame Aux Camelias]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']], ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Fédora]]'' and ''[[La Tosca]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]], and ''[[L'Aiglon]]'' by [[Edmond Rostand]]. She also played male roles, including Shakespeare's [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]. Rostand called her "the queen of the pose and the princess of the gesture", while Hugo praised her "golden voice". She made several theatrical tours around the world, and was one of the first prominent actresses to make sound recordings and to act in motion pictures.

==Early life==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt and her mother.jpg|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt with her mother]]

Sarah Bernhardt was born Henriette-Rosine Bernard at 5 rue de L'École-de-Médicine in the Latin Quarter of [[Paris]] on 22 or 23 October 1844.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some uncertainty exists about the date. See [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sarah-Bernhardt ''Encyclopedia Brittanica'' online Tierchant (2009), page 15 and Skinner (1967) page 1, and section below on birthdate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310044948/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sarah-Bernhardt |date=10 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the illegitimate daughter of Judith Bernard (also known as Julie and in France as Youle), a [[Dutch Jewish]] courtesan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/07/style/sarah-bernhardt-and-the-divine-lie.html|title=Sarah Bernhardt and the Divine Lie|last=Blume|first=Mary|date=7 October 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171214-sarah-bernhardt-was-she-the-first-a-list-actress|title=Sarah Bernhardt: Was she the first ‘A-list’ actress?|accessdate=23 June 2018|date=15 December 2017|last=Williams|first=Holly|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/sarah-bernhardt-goddess-with-a-golden-voice-347025.html|title=Sarah Bernhardt: Goddess with a golden voice|last=Koenig|first=Rhoda|date=22 February 2006|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/sarah-bernhardt-robert-gottlieb-review|title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt by Robert Gottlieb|accessdate=23 June 2018|date=24 October 2010|last=Laing|first=Olivia|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[prostitute]] with a wealthy or upper-class clientele. The name of her father is not recorded. According to some sources, he was probably the son of a wealthy merchant from Le Havre.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–14}} Bernhardt later wrote that her father's family paid for her education, insisted she be baptized as a Catholic, and left a large sum to be paid when she came of age.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–14}} Her mother traveled frequently, and saw little of her daughter. She placed the child with a nurse in [[Brittany]], then in a cottage in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly]].{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=13–14}}

When Sarah was seven, her mother sent her to a boarding school for young ladies in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy|Auteuil]], paid with funds from her father's family. There, she acted in her first theatrical performance in the play ''Clothilde'', where she had the role of the Queen of the Fairies, and performed her first of many dramatic death scenes.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=13–14}}

While Sarah was in the boarding school, her mother rose to the top ranks of Parisian courtesans, consorting with politicians, bankers, generals, and writers. Her patrons and friends included [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny]], the half-brother of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and President of the French legislature.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=29}} At the age of 10, with the sponsorship of Morny, Sarah was admitted to Grandchamp, an exclusive Augustine [[convent school]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|pages=17–20}} At the convent, she performed the part of the [[Archangel Raphael]] in the story of ''[[Tobias and the Angel (opera)|Tobias and the Angel]]''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=25–26}} She declared her intention to become a nun, but did not always follow convent rules; she was accused of sacrilege when she arranged a Christian burial, with a procession and ceremony, for her pet lizard.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=28}}

In 1859, Sarah learned that her father had died overseas.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=68}} Her mother summoned a family council, including Morny, to decide what to do with her. Morny proposed that Sarah should become an actress, an idea that horrified Sarah, as she had never been inside a theater. {{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=77}} Morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the [[Comedie Française]] in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend [[Alexandre Dumas]], ''père''. The play they attended was ''Brittanicus'', by [[Jean Racine]], followed by the classical comedy ''Amphitryon'' by [[Plautus]]. Sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play, she began to sob loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=77}} Morny and others in their party were angry at her and left, but Dumas comforted her, and later told Morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her "my little star".{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=22–24}}

Morny used his influence with the composer [[Daniel Auber]], the head of the [[Paris Conservatory]], to arrange for her to audition. She began preparing, as she described it in her memoirs, "with that vivid exaggeration with which I embrace any new enterprise."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=78–85}} Dumas coached her. The jury was composed of Auber and five leading actors and actresses from the Comédie Française. She was supposed to recite verses from Racine, but no one had told her that she needed someone to give her cues as she recited. Bernhardt told the jury she would instead recite the fable of the Two Pigeons by [[La Fontaine]]. The jurors were skeptical, but the fervor and pathos of her recitation won them over, and she was invited to become a student.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=25–30}}

==Debut and departure from the Comédie-Française (1862–1864)==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="250"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Bernhardt studied acting at the Conservatory from January 1860 until 1862 under two prominent actors of the Comédie Française, [[Joseph-Isidore Samson]] and Jean-Baptiste Provost. She wrote in her memoirs that Provost taught her diction and grand gestures, while Samson taught her the power of simplicity.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=102–103}} For the stage, she changed her name from "Bernhard" to "Bernhardt". While studying, she also received her first marriage proposal, from a wealthy businessman who offered her 500 thousand francs. He wept when she refused. Bernhardt wrote that she was "confused, sorry, and delighted—because he loved me the way people love in plays at the theater."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=96}}

Before the first examination for her tragedy class, she tried to straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which made it even more uncontrollable, and came down with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that she hardly recognized it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her performance were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=42–44}} Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, [[Camille Doucet]]. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre Français]],{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=42–44}} who offered Bernhardt a place as a ''pensionnaire'' at the theater, at a minimum salary.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=34–35}}

Bernhardt made her debut with the company on 31 August 1862 in the title role of Racine's ''[[Iphigénie]]''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=45–46}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In her memoirs, Bernhardt gives the date of her debut as 1 September&lt;/ref&gt; Her premiere was not a success. She experienced stage fright and rushed her lines. Some audience members made fun of her thin figure. When the performance ended, Provost was waiting in the wings, and she asked his forgiveness. He told her, "I can forgive you, and you'll eventually forgive yourself, but Racine in his grave never will."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=37}} Francisque Sarcey, the influential theater critic of ''L'Opinion Nationale'' and ''Le Temps'', wrote: "she carries herself well and pronounces with perfect precision. That is all that can be said about her at the moment."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=37}}

Bernhardt did not remain long with the Comédie-Française. She played Henrietta in [[Molière|Molière's]] ''[[Les Femmes Savantes]]'' and Hippolyte in ''L'Étourdi'', and the title role in [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe's]] ''Valérie'', but did not impress the critics, or the other members of the company, who had resented her rapid rise. The weeks passed, but she was given no further roles.{{Sfn|Tierchant| 2009|page=47}} Her hot temper also got her into trouble; when a theater doorkeeper addressed her as "Little Bernhardt", she broke her umbrella over his head. She apologized profusely, and when the doorkeeper retired 20 years later, she bought a cottage for him in Normandy.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=38}} At a ceremony honoring the birthday of Molière on 15 January 1863, Bernhardt invited her younger sister, Regina, to accompany her. Regina accidentally stood on the train of the gown of a leading actress of the company, Zaire-Nathalie Martel (1816–1885), known as Madame Nathalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monval |first=Georges |title=Comédie-française (1658–1900): Liste alphabétique des sociétaires depuis Molière jusqu'à nos jours |location=Paris |publisher=Aux Bureaux de l'Amateur d'autographes |year=1900 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Nathalie pushed Regina off the gown, causing her to strike a stone column and gash her forehead. Regina and Madame Nathalie began shouting at one another, and Bernhardt stepped forward and slapped Madame Nathalie on the cheek. The older actress fell onto another actor. Thierry asked that Bernhardt apologize to Madame Nathalie. Bernhardt refused to do so until Madame Nathalie apologized to Regina. Bernhardt had already been scheduled for a new role with the theater, and had begun rehearsals. Madame Nathalie demanded that Bernhardt be dropped from the role unless she apologized. Since neither would yield, and Madame Nathalie was a senior member of the company, Thierry was forced to ask Bernhardt to leave.{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|page=52}}

==The Gymnase and Brussels (1864–1866)==
Her family could not understand her departure from the theater; it was inconceivable to them that anyone would walk away from the most prestigious theater in Paris at the age of 18.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=135}} Instead, she went to a popular theater, the Gymnase, where she became an understudy to two of the leading actresses. She almost immediately caused another offstage scandal, when she was invited to recite poetry at a reception at the [[Tuileries Palace]] hosted by Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie, along with other actors of the Gymnase. She chose to recite two romantic poems by Victor Hugo, unaware that Hugo was a bitter critic of the emperor. Following the first poem, the Emperor and Empress rose and walked out, followed by the court and the other guests.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=44}} Her next role at the Gymnase, as a foolish Russian princess, was entirely unsuited for her; her mother told her that her performance was "ridiculous".{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=135}} She decided abruptly to quit the theater to travel, and like her mother, to take on lovers. She went briefly to Spain, then, at the suggestion of Alexandre Dumas, to Belgium.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=42–46}}

She carried to Brussels letters of introduction from Dumas, and was admitted to the highest levels of society. According to some later accounts, she attended a masked ball in Brussels where she met the young [[Prince of Ligne|Prince de Ligne]], a young Belgian aristocrat, and had an affair with him.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=46–47}} Other accounts say that they met in Paris, where the Prince came often to attend the theater.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=55}} The affair was cut short when she learned that her mother had suffered a heart attack. She returned to Paris, where she found that her mother was better, but that she herself was pregnant from her affair with the Prince. She did not notify the Prince. Her mother did not want the fatherless child born under her roof, so she moved to a small apartment on rue Duphot, and on 22 December 1864, the 20-year-old actress gave birth to her only child, Maurice Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=48}}

Some accounts say that Prince Henri had not forgotten her. According to these versions, he learned her address from the theater, arrived in Paris, and moved into the apartment with Bernhardt. After a month, he returned to Brussels and told his family that he wanted to marry the actress. The family of the Prince sent his uncle, General de Ligne, to break up the romance, threatening to disinherit him if he married Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=47–52}} According to other accounts, the Prince denied any responsibility for the child.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=55}} She later called the affair "her abiding wound", but she never discussed Maurice's parentage with anyone. When asked who his father was, she sometimes answered, "I could never make up my mind whether his father was [[Léon Gambetta|Gambetta]], Victor Hugo, or [[General Boulanger]]."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=52}} Many years later, in January 1885, when Bernhardt was famous, the Prince came to Paris and offered to formally recognize Maurice as his son, but Maurice politely declined, explaining he was entirely satisfied to be the son of Sarah Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=212}}

==The Odéon (1866–1872)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt - Le Passant.png|thumb|Bernhardt as the boy troubadour, Zanetto, in ''Le Passant'' (1869) by [[François Coppée]]]]

To support herself after the birth of Maurice, Bernhardt played minor roles and understudies at the Port-Saint-Martin, a popular melodrama theater. In early 1866, she obtained a reading with Felix Duquesnel, director of the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de L’Odéon]] on the Left Bank. Duquesnel described the reading years later, saying, "I had before me a creature who was marvelous gifted, intelligent to the point of genius, with enormous energy under an appearance frail and delicate, and a savage will." The co-director of the theater for finance, Charles de Chilly, wanted to reject her as unreliable and too thin, but Duquesnel was enchanted; he hired her for the theater at a modest salary of 150 francs a month, which he paid out of his own pocket.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=62}} The Odéon was second in prestige only to the Comédie Française, and unlike that very traditional theater, specialized in more modern productions. The Odéon was popular with the students of the Left Bank. Her first performances with the theater were not successful. She was cast in highly stylized and frivolous 18th-century comedies, whereas her strong point on stage was her complete sincerity.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=54}} Her thin figure also made her look ridiculous in the ornate costumes. Dumas, her strongest supporter, commented after one performance, "she has the head of a virgin and the body of a broomstick."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=55}} Soon, however, with different plays and more experience, her performances improved; she was praised for her performance of Cordelia in ''[[King Lear]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} In June 1867, she played two roles in ''[[Athalie]]'' by Jean Racine;  the part of a young woman and a young boy, Zacharie, the first of many male parts she played in her career. The influential critic Sarcey wrote "... she charmed her audience like a little Orpheus."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=55}}

Her breakthrough performance was in the 1868 revival of ''Kean'' by Alexandre Dumas, in which she played the female lead part of Anna Danby. The play was interrupted in the beginning by disturbances in the audience by young spectators who called out, "Down with Dumas! Give us Hugo!". Bernhardt addressed the audience directly: "Friends, you wish to defend the cause of justice. Are you doing it by making Monsieur Dumas responsible for the banishment of Monsieur Hugo?".{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=68}} With this the audience laughed and applauded and fell silent. At the final curtain, she received an enormous ovation, and Dumas hurried backstage to congratulate her. When she exited the theater, a crowd had gathered at the stage door and tossed flowers at her. Her salary was immediately raised to 250 francs a month.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=55–58}}

Her next success was her performance in [[François Coppée]]'s ''Le Passant'', which premiered at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odeon]] on 14 January 1868,{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=63}} playing the part of the boy troubadour, Zanetto, in a romantic renaissance tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Aston| first=Elaine| title=Sarah Bernhardt: A French Actress on the English Stage| year=1989| publisher=Berg | isbn=0854960198| location=Oxford| page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Theophile Gautier described the "delicate and tender charm" of her performance. It played for 150 performances, plus a command performance at the [[Tuileries Palace]] for Napoleon III and his court. Afterwards, the Emperor sent her a brooch with his initials written in diamonds.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=64}}

In her memoirs, she wrote of her time at the Odéon: "It was the theater that I loved the most, and that I only left with regret. We all loved each other. Everyone was gay. The theater was a like a continuation of school. All the young came there... I remember my few months at the Comédie Française. That little world was stiff, gossipy, jealous. I remember my few months at the Gymnase. There they talked only about dresses and hats, and chattered about a hundred things that had nothing to do with art. At the Odéon, I was happy. We thought only of putting on plays. We rehearsed mornings, afternoons, all the time. I adored that." Bernhardt lived with her longtime friend and assistant Madame Guerard and her son in a small cottage in the suburb of [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy|Auteuil]], and drove herself to the theater in a small carriage. She developed a close friendship with the writer [[George Sand]], and performed in two plays that she authored.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=156}} She received celebrities in her dressing room, including [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Leon Gambetta]]. In 1869, as she became more prosperous, she moved to a larger seven-room apartment at 16 rue Auber in the center of Paris. Her mother began to visit her for the first time in years, and her grandmother, a strict Orthodox Jew, moved into the apartment to take care of Maurice. Bernhardt added a maid and a cook to her household, as well as the beginning of a collection of animals; she had one or two dogs with her at all times, and two turtles moved freely around the apartment.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=60–61}}

In 1868, a fire completely destroyed her apartment, along with all of her belongings. She had neglected to purchase insurance. The brooch presented to her by the Emperor and her pearls melted, as did the tiara presented by one of her lovers, Khalid Bey. She found the diamonds in the ashes, and the managers of the Odeon organized a benefit performance. The most famous soprano of the time, [[Adelina Patti]], performed for free. In addition, the grandmother of her father donated 120,000 francs. Bernhardt was able to buy an even larger residence, with two salons and a large dining room, at 4 rue de Rome.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=72–73}}

===Wartime service at the Odéon (1870–1871)===
The outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] abruptly interrupted her theatrical career. The news of the defeat of the French Army, the surrender of Napoleon III at Sedan, and the proclamation of the [[Third French Republic]] on 4 September 1870 was followed by a siege of the city by the Prussian Army. Paris was cut off from news and from its food supply, and the theaters were closed. Bernhardt took charge of converting the Odéon into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battles outside the city.{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991|pages=82–85}} She organized the placement of 32 beds in the lobby and the foyers, brought in her personal chef to prepare soup for the patients, and persuaded her wealthy friends and admirers to donate supplies for the hospital. Besides organizing the hospital, she worked as a nurse, assisting the chief surgeon with amputations and operations.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=79}} When the coal supply of the city ran out, Bernhardt used old scenery, benches, and stage props for fuel to heat the theater.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=75}} In early January 1871, after 16 weeks of the siege, the Germans began to bombard the city with long-range cannons. The patients had to be moved to the cellar, and before long, the hospital was forced to close. Bernhardt arranged for serious cases to be transferred to another military hospital, and she rented an apartment on rue de Provence to house the remaining 20 patients. By the end of the siege, Bernhardt's hospital had cared for more than 150 wounded soldiers, including a young undergraduate from the École Polytechnique, [[Ferdinand Foch]], who later commanded the Allied armies in the [[First World War]].{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=74–78}}

The French government signed an armistice on 19 January 1871, and Bernhardt learned that her son and family had been moved to Hamburg. She went to the new chief executive of the French republic, [[Adolphe Thiers]], and obtained a pass to go to Germany to return them. When she returned to Paris several weeks later, the city was under the rule of the [[Paris Commune]]. She moved again, taking her family to [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. She later returned to her apartment on the rue de Rome in May, after the Commune was defeated by the French Army.

The [[Tuileries Palace]], city hall of Paris, and many other public buildings had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and he asked her to play the lead in a new play, ''Jean-Marie'' by [[André Theuriet]]. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her that he understood and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=74–78}}

''Jean-Marie'', about a young Breton woman forced by her father to marry an old man she did not love, was another critical and popular success for Bernhardt. The critic Sarcey wrote, "She has the sovereign grace, the penetrating charm, the I don't know what. She is a natural artist, an incomparable artist."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=91}} The directors of the Odéon next decided to stage ''[[Ruy Blas]]'', a play written by Victor Hugo in 1838, with Bernhardt playing the role of the Queen of Spain. Hugo himself attended all the rehearsals. At first, Bernhardt pretended to be indifferent to him, but he gradually won her over and she became a fervent admirer. The play premiered on 16 January 1872. The opening night was attended by the Prince of Wales and by Hugo himself; after the performance, Hugo approached Bernhardt, dropped to one knee, and kissed her hand.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=84–85}}

''Ruy Blas'' played to packed houses. A few months after it opened, Bernhardt received an invitation from [[Emile Perrin]], Director of the Comédie Française, asking if she would return, and offering her 12,000 francs a year, compared with less than 10,000 at the Odéon.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=97}} Bernhardt asked Chilly if he would match the offer, but he refused. Always pressed by her growing expenses and growing household to earn more money, she announced her departure from the Odéon when she finished the run of ''Ruy Blas.'' Chilly responded with a lawsuit, and she was forced to pay 6,000 francs of damages. After the 100th performance of ''Ruy Blas'', Hugo gave a dinner for Bernhardt and her friends, toasting "His adorable Queen and her Golden Voice."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=84–85}}

She formally returned to the Comédie Francaise on 1 October 1872, and quickly took on some of the most famous and demanding roles in French theater. She played Junie in ''Britannicus'' by Jean Racine, the male role of Cherubin in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'' by [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and the lead in Voltaire's five-act tragedy [[Zaïre]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=98}} In 1873, with just 74 hours to learn the lines and practice the part, she played the lead in Racine's ''[[Phédre]]'', playing opposite the celebrated tragedian, [[Jean Mounet-Sully]], who soon became her lover. The leading French critic Sarcey wrote, "This is nature itself served by marvelous intelligence, by a soul of fire, by the most melodious voice that ever enchanted human ears. This woman plays with her heart, with her entrails."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=104-107}} ''Phédre'' became her most famous classical role, performed over the years around the world, often for audiences who knew little or no French; she made them understand by her voice and gestures.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=17}}

In 1877, she had another success as Dona Sol in ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', a tragedy written 47 years earlier by Victor Hugo. Her lover in the play was her lover off-stage, as well, Mounet-Sully. Hugo himself was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: "Madame, you were great and charming; you moved me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. I place it at your feet." The note was accompanied by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=328}}

She maintained a highly theatrical lifestyle in her house on the rue de Rome. She kept a satin-lined coffin in her bedroom, and occasionally slept in it or lay in it to study her roles, though, contrary to the popular stories, she never took it with her on her travels. She cared for her younger sister who was ill with tuberculosis, and allowed her to sleep in her own bed, while she slept in the coffin. She posed in it for photographs, adding to the legends she created about herself.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=100}}

Bernhardt repaired her old relationships with the other members of the Comédie Française; she participated in a benefit for Madame Nathalie, the actress she had once slapped. However, she was frequently in conflict with Perrin, the director of the theater. In 1878, during the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition]], she took a flight over Paris with balloonist Pierre Giffard and painter George Clairin, in a balloon decorated with the name of her current character, ''Dona Sol''. An unexpected storm carried the balloon far outside of Paris to a small town. When she returned by train to the city, Perrin was furious; he fined Bernhardt a thousand francs, citing a theater rule which required actors to request permission before they left Paris. Bernhardt refused to pay, and threatened to resign from the Comédie. Perrin recognized that he could not afford to let her go. Perrin and the Minister of Fine Arts arranged a compromise; she withdrew her resignation, and in return was raised to a ''societaire'', the highest rank of the theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=115–117&lt;!-- 110? --&gt;}}

==Triumph in London and departure from the Comédie Française (1879–1880)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt 1879.jpg|thumb|Sarah Bernhardt in 1879]]
Bernhardt was earning a substantial amount at the theater, but her expenses were even greater. By this time she had eight servants, and she built her first house, an imposing mansion on rue Fortuny, not far from [[Parc Monceau]]. She looked for additional ways to earn money. In June 1879, while the theater of the Comédie Française in Paris was being remodeled, Perrin took the company on tour to London. Shortly before the tour began, a British theater [[impresario]] named Edward Jarrett traveled to Paris and proposed that she give private performances in the homes of wealthy Londoners; the fee she would receive for each performance was greater than her monthly salary with the Comédie.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=118}} When Perrin read in the press about the private performances, he was furious. Furthermore, the Gaiety Theater in London demanded that Bernhardt star in the opening performance, contrary to the traditions of Comédie Française, where roles were assigned by seniority, and the idea of stardom was scorned. When Perrin protested, saying that Bernhardt was only 10th or 11th in seniority, the Gaiety manager threatened to cancel the performance; Perrin had to give in. He scheduled Bernhardt to perform one act of ''Phédre'' on the opening night, between two traditional French comedies, ''Le Misanthrope'' and ''Les Précieuses''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=118–20}}

On 4 June 1879, just before the opening curtain of her premiere in ''Phédre,'' she suffered an attack of stage fright. She wrote later that she also pitched her voice too high, and was unable to lower it.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|pages=351–353}} Nonetheless, the performance was a triumph. Though a majority of the audience could not understand Racine's classical French, she captivated them with her voice and gestures; one member of the audience, Sir George Arthur, wrote that "she set every nerve and fiber in their bodies throbbing and held them spellbound."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=128}} In addition to her performances of ''Zaire'', ''Phédre'', ''Hernani'', and other plays with her troupe, she gave the private recitals in the homes of British aristocrats arranged by Jarrett, who also arranged an exhibition of her sculptures and paintings in [[Piccadilly]], which was attended by both the prince of Wales and Prime Minister Gladstone. While in London, she added to her personal menagerie of animals. In London, she purchased three dogs, a parrot, and a monkey, and made a side trip to Liverpool, where she purchased a cheetah, a parrot, and a wolfhound and received a gift of six chameleons, which she kept in her rented house on Chester Square, and then took back to Paris.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=130–133}}

Back in Paris, she was increasingly discontented with Perrin and the management of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in a new play, ''L'Aventurière'' by [[Emile Augier]], a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticized by the playwright. She responded, "I know I'm bad, but not as bad as your lines." The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin, "You forced me to play when I was not ready... what I foresaw came to pass... this is my first failure at the Comédie and my last." She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs, plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=144}} She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theater was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theater.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=142}}

==''La Dame aux Camélias'' and first American tour (1880–1881)==
[[File:SarahBernhardt alsKameliendame1881.jpg|thumb|''[[La Dame aux Camelias]]'' (1881)]]

In April 1880, as soon as he learned Bernhardt had resigned from the Comédie Française, the impresario Edward Jarrett hurried to Paris and proposed that she make a theatrical tour of England and then the United States. She could select her repertoire and the cast. She would receive 5,000 francs per performance, plus 15% of any earnings over 15,0000 franca,  plus all of her expenses, plus an account in her name for 100,000 francs, the amount she owed to the Comédie Française. She accepted immediately.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=148–149}}

Now on her own, Bernhardt first assembled and tried out her new troupe at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris. She performed for the first time ''[[La Dame aux Camélias]]'', by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils''. She did not create the role; the play had first been performed by Eugénie Dochein in 1852, but it quickly became her most performed and most famous role. She played the role more than a thousand times, and acted regularly and successfully in it until the end of her life. Audiences were often in tears during her famous death scene at the end.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=146–147}}

She could not perform ''La Dame aux Camélias'' on a London stage because of British censorship laws; instead, she put on four of her proven successes, including ''Hernani'' and ''Phèdre'', plus four new roles, including ''[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]] and the drawing-room comedy ''Frou-frou'' by Meilhac-Halévy, both of which were highly successful on the London stage.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=150}} In six of the eight plays in her repertoire, she died dramatically in the final act. When she returned to Paris from London, the Comédie Française asked her to come back, but she refused their offer, explaining that she was making far more money on her own. Instead, she took her new company and new plays on tour to Brussels and Copenhagen, and then on a tour of French provincial cities.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=142–145}}

She and her troupe departed from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'' at Booth's Theater before an audience which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, but it was not necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood perfectly still, with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=163}}

Bernhardt's first American tour carried her to 157 performances in 51 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|9688|Sarah Bernhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled on a special train with her own luxurious palace car, which carried her two maids, two cooks, a waiter, her maitre d'hôtel, and her personal assistant, Madame Guérard. It also carried an actor named Édouard Angelo whom she had selected to serve as her leading man, and, according to most accounts, her lover during the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverthorne |first=Elizabeth |title=Sarah Bernhardt |series=Women in the Arts series |year=2003 |publisher=Chelsea House |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7910-7458-7 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=159}} From New York, she made a side trip to [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], where she met [[Thomas Edison]], who made a brief recording of her reciting a verse from ''Phèdre'' {{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She crisscrossed the United States and Canada from Montreal and Toronto to Saint Louis and New Orleans, usually performing each evening, and departing immediately after the performance. She gave countless press interviews and in Boston posed for photos on the back of a dead whale. She was condemned as immoral by the Bishop of Montreal and by the [[Methodist]] press, which only increased ticket sales.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=166}} She performed ''Phèdre'' six times and ''La Dame Aux Camilias'' (which Jarrett had renamed "Camille" to make it easier for Americans to pronounce) 65 times. On 3 May 1881, she gave her final performance of ''Camelias'' in New York. Throughout her life, she always insisted on being paid in cash. When Bernhardt returned to France, she brought with her a chest filled with $194,000 in gold coins {{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=188–196}} She described the result of her trip to her friends: "I crossed the oceans, carrying my dream of art in myself, and the genius of my nation triumphed. I planted the French verb in the heart of a foreign literature, and it is that of which I am most proud."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=174}}

==Return to Paris, European tour, ''Fédora'' to ''Theodora'' (1881–1886)==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt - Foedora.png|thumb|As ''Fédora'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] (1882)]]

No crowd greeted Bernhardt when she returned to Paris on 5 May 1881, and theater managers offered no new roles; the Paris press ignored her tour, and much of the Paris theater world resented her leaving the most prestigious national theater to earn a fortune abroad.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=198–99}} When no new plays or offers appeared, she went to London for a successful three-week run at the Gaiety Theater. This London tour included the first British performance of ''La Dame aux Camelias'' at the Shaftesbury Theater; her friend the Prince of Wales persuaded [[Queen Victoria]] to authorize the performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=176}} Many years later, she gave a private performance of the play for the Queen while she was on holiday in Nice.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=105}} When she returned to Paris, Bernhardt contrived to make a surprise performance at the annual 14 July patriotic spectacle at the Paris Opera, which was attended by the President of France, and a houseful of dignitaries and celebrities. She recited the ''Marseillaise'', dressed in a white robe with a tricolor banner, and at the end dramatically waved the French flag. The audience gave her a standing ovation, showered her with flowers, and demanded that she recite the song two more times.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=200–202}}

With her place in the French theater world restored, Bernhardt negotiated a contract to perform at the Vaudeville Theater in Paris for 1500 francs per performance, as well as 25% of the net profit. She also announced that she would not be available to begin until 1882. She departed on a tour of theaters in the French provinces, and then to Italy, Greece, Hungary, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Austria, and Russia. In [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]], she encountered anti-Semitic crowds who threw stones at her; [[pogroms]] were being conducted, forcing the Jewish population to leave.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=186}} However, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, she performed before Czar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], who broke court protocol and bowed to her. During her tour, she also gave performances for King [[Alfonso XII]] of Spain, and the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]. The only European country where she refused to play was Germany, due to the German annexation of French territory after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=206–208}} Just before the tour began, she met [[Jacques Damala]], who went with her as leading man and then, for eight months, became her first and only husband. {{See below|1=Personal life}}
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt as Theodora by Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|''Theodora'', photo by Nadar (1884)]]

When she returned to Paris, she was offered a new role in ''[[Fédora]]'', a melodrama written for her by [[Victorien Sardou]]. It opened on 12 December 1882, with her husband Damala as the male lead, and received good reviews. Critic Maurice Baring wrote, "a secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction, which was at once exotic and cerebral... She literally hypnotized her audience."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=218}} Another journalist wrote, "She is incomparable... The extreme love, the extreme agony, the extreme suffering."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=195}} However, the abrupt end of her marriage shortly after the premiere put her back into financial distress. She had leased and refurbished a theater, the Ambigu, specifically to give her husband leading roles, and made her 18-year-old son Maurice, who had no business experience, the manager. ''Fédora'' ran for just 50 performances and lost 400,000 francs. She was forced to give up the Ambigu, and then, in February 1883, to sell her jewelry, her carriages, and her horses at an auction.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=196–197}}

When Damala left, she took on a new leading man and lover, the poet and playwright [[Jean Richepin]], who accompanied her on a quick tour of European cities to help pay off her debts.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=224–226}} She renewed her relationship with the Prince of Wales, the future King [[Edward VII]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=200}} When they returned to Paris, Bernhardt leased the theater of Porte Saint-Martin and starred in a new play by Richepin, ''Nana-Sahib'', a costume drama about love in British India in 1857. The play and Richepin's acting were poor, and it quickly closed.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=202}} Richepin then wrote an adaptation of ''[[MacBeth|Macbeth]]'' in French, with Bernhardt as Lady Macbeth, but it was also a failure. The only person who praised the play was [[Oscar Wilde]], who was then living in Paris. He began writing a play, ''Salomé,'' in French, especially for Bernhardt, though it was quickly banned by British censors and she never performed it.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=228–229}}

Bernhardt then performed a new play by Sardou, ''Theodora'' (1884), a melodrama set in sixth-century [[Byzantium]]. Sardou wrote a nonhistoric but dramatic new death scene for Bernhardt; in his version, the empress was publicly strangled, whereas the historical empress died of cancer. Bernhardt travelled to [[Ravenna]], Italy, to study and sketch the costumes seen in Byzantine mosaic murals, and had them reproduced for her own costumes. The play opened on 26 December 1884 and ran for 300 performances in Paris, and 100 in London, and was a financial success. She was able to pay off most of her debts, and bought a lion cub, which she named Justinian, for her home menagerie.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}} She also renewed her love affair with her former lead actor, Philippe Garnier.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967| pages=232–233}}

==World tours (1886–1892)==

''Theodora'' was followed by two failures. In 1885, in homage to Victor Hugo, who had died a few months earlier, she staged one of his older plays, ''[[Marion Delorme]]'', written in 1831, but the play was outdated and her role did not give her a chance to show her talents.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} She next put on ''Hamlet'', with her lover Philippe Garnier in the leading role and Bernhardt in the relatively minor role of Ophelia. The critics and audiences were not impressed, and the play was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=213}} Bernhardt had built up large expenses, which included a 10,000 francs a month allowance paid to her son Maurice, a passionate gambler. Bernhardt was forced to sell her chalet in Saint-Addresse and her mansion on rue Fortuny, and part of her collection of animals. Her impresario, Edouard Jarrett, immediately proposed she make another world tour, this time to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chili, Peru, Panama, Cuba, and Mexico, then on to Texas, New York, England, Ireland, and Scotland. She was on tour for 15 months, from early 1886 until late 1887. On the eve of departure, she told a French reporter: "I passionately love this life of adventures. I detest knowing in advance what they are going to serve at my dinner, and I detest a hundred thousand times more knowing what will happen to me, for better or worse. I adore the unexpected."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=210–211}}

In every city she visited, she was feted and cheered by audiences. The actors Edouard Angelo and Philippe Garnier were her leading men. Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] attended all of her performances in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and presented her with a gold bracelet with diamonds, which was almost immediately stolen from her hotel. The two leading actors both fell ill with [[yellow fever]], and her long-time manager, Edward Jarrett, died of a heart attack. Bernhardt was undaunted, however, and went crocodile hunting at [[Guayaquil]], and also bought more animals for her menagerie. Her performances in every city were sold out, and by the end of the tour, she had earned more than a million francs. The tour allowed her to purchase her final home, a mansion at 56 boulevard Pereire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_Pereire|title=Boulevard Pereire — Wikipédia|author=|date=|website=wikipedia.org|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919151149/https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard_Pereire|archivedate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} which she filled with her paintings, plants, souvenirs, and animals.{{Sfn| Tierchant| 2009| pages=214–216}}
 
From then on, whenever she ran short of money (which generally happened every three or four years), she went on tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, the brother of the Czar.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in ''La Tosca''. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=248}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When Bernhardt returned from her 1886–1887 tour, she received a new invitation to return to the Comédie Française. The theater management was willing to forget the conflict of her two previous periods there, and offered a payment of 150,000 francs a year. The money appealed to her, and she began negotiations. However, the senior members of the company protested the high salary offered, and conservative defenders of the more traditional theater also complained; one anti-Bernhardt critic, Albert Delpit of ''Le Gaulois'', wrote, "Madame Sarah Bernhardt is forty-three; she can no longer be useful to the Comédie. Moreover, what roles could she have? I can only imagine that she could play mothers..." Bernhardt was deeply offended and immediately broke off negotiations.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} She turned once again to Sardou, who had written a new play for her, ''La Tosca'', which featured a prolonged and extremely dramatic death scene at the end. The play was staged at the Porte Saint-Martin Theater, opening on 24 November 1887. It was extremely popular, and critically acclaimed. Bernhardt played the role for 29 consecutive sold-out performances. The success of the play allowed Bernhardt to buy a new pet lion for her household menagerie. She named him Scarpia, after the villain of ''La Tosca''.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=222}} The play inspired [[Giacomo Puccini]] to write one of his most famous operas, ''[[Tosca]]'' (1900).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tosca|Britannica online, ''Tosca'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this success, she acted in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she acted in a stage version of the controversial drama ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' by [[Emile Zola]]. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book's confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, "My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=226}} The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gassner |first1=John |last2=Quinn |first2=Edward |title=Readers' Encyclopedia of World Drama |year=1969 |publisher=Dover Publications |page=935}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then performed another traditional melodrama, ''Francillon'' by Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'' in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, ''L'Aveu'', disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with ''[[Jeanne d'Arc]]'' by the poet [[Jules Barbier]], in which the 45-year-old actress played [[Joan of Arc]], a 19-year-old martyr.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=145}} Barbier had previously written the librettos for some of the most famous French operas of the period, including ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' by [[Charles Gounod]] and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]]. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou, ''Cleopatra'', which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable [[Death of Cleopatra|death scene]]. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous [[asp (reptile)|asp]] which bites [[Cleopatra]]. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. "I shall see them," she explained. "If I catch sight of my hand, it will be the hand of Cleopatra."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=148}}

Bernhardt made a two-year world tour (1891–1893) to replenish her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]], and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed every aspect of the theater, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gottlieb| first=Robert| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| location=London| page=121| isbn= 0300192592}}&lt;/ref&gt; She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to take off their hats during performances, so the rest of the audience could see, and eliminated the prompter's box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theater the common practice of hiring ''claqueurs'' in the audience to applaud stars.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=232}} She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] to design the first of a series of posters for her play ''Gismonda''. He continued to make posters of her for six years.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}

In five years, Bernhardt produced nine plays, three of which were financially successful. The first was a revival of her performance as Phédre, which she took on tour around the world. In 1898, she had another success, in the play ''Lorenzaccio'', playing the male lead role in a Renaissance revenge drama written in 1834 by [[Alfred de Musset]], but never before actually staged. As her biographer [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]] wrote, she did not try to be overly masculine when she performed male roles: "Her male impersonations had the sexless grace of the voices of choirboys, or the not quite real pathos of [[Pierrot]]."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=252}} Anatole France wrote of her performance in ''Lorenzaccio'': "She formed out of her own self a young man melancholic, full of poetry and of truth."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=242}} This was followed by another successful melodrama by Sardou, ''[[Gismonda]]'', one of Bernhardt's few plays not finishing with a dramatic death scene. Her co-star was [[Lucien Guitry]], who also acted as her leading man until the end of her career. Besides Guitry, she shared the stage with Edouard de Max, her leading man in 20 productions, and [[Constant Coquelin]], who frequently toured with her.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=252–254}}

In April 1895, she played the lead role in a romantic and poetic fantasy, ''Princess Lointaine'', by little-known 27-year-old poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. It was not a monetary success and lost 200,000 francs, but it began a long theatrical relationship between Bernhardt and Rostand. Rostand went on to write ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and became one of the most popular French playwrights of the period.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=264}}

In 1898, she performed the female lead in the controversial play ''La Ville Morte'' by the Italian poet and playwright [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]; the play was fiercely attacked by critics because of its theme of incest between brother and sister. Along with Emile Zola and Victorien Sardou, Bernhardt also became an outspoken defender of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer falsely accused of betraying France. The issue divided Parisian society; a conservative newspaper ran the headline, "Sarah Bernhardt has joined the Jews against the Army", and Bernhardt's own son Maurice condemned Dreyfus; he refused to speak to her for a year.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=259–260}}

At the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Bernhardt staged and performed in several modern plays, but she was not a follower of the more natural school of acting that was coming into fashion at the end of the 19th century, preferring a more dramatic expression of emotions. "In the theater," she declared, "the natural is good, but the sublime is even better."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=234}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Despite her successes, her debts continued to mount, reaching two million gold francs by the end of 1898. Bernhardt was forced to give up the Renaissance, and was preparing to go on another world tour when she learned that a much larger Paris theater, the [[Théâtre des Nations]] on [[Place du Châtelet]], was for lease. The theater had 1,700 seats, twice the size of the Renaissance, enabling her to pay off the cost of performances more quickly; it had an enormous stage and backstage, allowing her to present several different plays a week; and since it was originally designed as a concert hall, it had excellent acoustics. On 1 January 1899, she signed a 25-year lease with the City of Paris, though she was already 55 years old.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=277}}

She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, and began to renovate it to suit her needs. The facade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=278}} She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her most famous roles, painted by Mucha, [[Louise Abbéma]], and Georges Clairin. Her dressing room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play ''L'Aiglon'', was decorated in [[Empire Style]], featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that was filled with the flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=262–63}}

Bernhardt opened the theater on 21 January 1899 with a revival of Sardou's ''La Tosca'', which she had first performed in 1887. This was followed by revivals of her other major successes, including ''Phédre'', ''Theodora'', ''Gismonda'', and ''La Dame aux Camélias'', plus Octave Feuillet's ''Dalila'', Gaston de Wailly's ''Patron Bénic'', and Rostand's ''La Samaritaine,'' a poetic retelling of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]. On 20 May, she premiered one of her most famous roles, playing the titular character of ''Hamlet'' in a prose adaptation which she had commissioned from Eugène Morand and [[Marcel Schwob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Robert| first=Gottlieb| title=Sarah: The Life of Sarah Bernhardt| year=2010| publisher=Yale University Press| page=142| isbn= 0300192592}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played Hamlet in a manner which was direct, natural, and very feminine.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=260}} Her performance received largely positive reviews in Paris, but mixed reviews in London. The British critic [[Max Beerbohm]] wrote, "the only compliment one can conscientiously pay her is that her Hamlet was, from first to last, a truly ''grand dame''."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=261}}

In 1900, Bernhardt presented ''L'Aiglon'', a new play by Rostand. She played the [[Napoleon I|Duc de Reichstadt]], the son of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], imprisoned by his unloving mother and family until his melancholy death in the [[Schonbrunn Palace]] in Vienna. ''L'Aiglon'' was a verse drama, six acts long. The 56-year-old actress studied the walk and posture of young cavalry officers and had her hair cut short to impersonate the young Duke. The Duke's stage mother, [[Marie-Louise of Austria]], was played by Maria Legault, an actress 14 years younger than Berhnardt. The play ended with a memorable death scene; according to one critic, she died "as dying angels would die if they were allowed to."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=260–261}} The play was extremely successful; it was especially popular with visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris International Exposition]], and ran for nearly a year, with standing-room places selling for as much as 600 gold francs. The play inspired the creation of Bernhardt souvenirs, including statuettes, medallions, fans, perfumes, postcards of her in the role, uniforms and cardboard swords for children, and pastries and cakes; the famed chef [[Escoffier]] added Peach Aiglon with Chantilly Cream to his repertoire of desserts.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=287–288}}

Bernhardt continued to employ Mucha to design her posters, and expanded his work to include theatrical sets, programs, costumes, and jewelry props. His posters became icons of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. To earn more money, Bernhardt set aside a certain number of printed posters of each play to sell to collectors.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=238–39}}{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=239–40}}

==Farewell tours (1901–1913)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After her season in Paris, Bernhardt performed ''L'Aiglon'' in London, and then made her sixth tour to the United States. On this tour, she traveled with Constant Coquelin, then the most popular leading man in France. Bernhardt played the secondary role of Roxanne to his [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], a role which he had premiered, and he co-starred with her as Flambeau in ''L'Aiglon'' and as the first grave-digger in ''Hamlet''.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=265–270}}

She also changed, for the first time, her resolution not to perform in Germany or the "occupied territories" of Alsace and Lorraine. In 1902, at the invitation of the French ministry of culture, she took part in the first cultural exchange between Germany and France since the 1870 war. She performed ''L'Aiglon'' 14 times in Germany; [[Kaiser William II]] of Germany attended two performances and hosted a dinner in her honor in Potsdam.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=290–291}}

During her German tour, she began to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, probably connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in ''L'Aiglon''. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilization of her leg. Bernhardt promised to see a doctor when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

In 1903, she had another unsuccessful role playing another masculine character in the opera ''[[Werther]]'', a gloomy adaptation of the story by German writer [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. However, she quickly came back with another hit, ''La Sorcière'' by Sardou. She played a Moorish sorceress in love with a Christian Spaniard, leading to her persecution by the church. This story of tolerance, coming soon after the Dreyfus affair, was financially successful, with Bernhardt often giving both a matinee and evening performance.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=294–295}}

Between 1904 and 1906, she appeared in a wide range of parts, including in ''[[Francesca di Rimini]]'' by [[Francis Marion Crawford]], the role of Fanny in ''[[Sappho]]'' by [[Alphonse Daudet]], the magician [[Circe]] in a play by Charles Richet, the part of [[Marie Antoinette]] in the historic drama ''Varennes'' by Lavedan and Lenôtre, the part of the prince-poet Landry in a version of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' by Richepin and [[Henri Cain]], and a new version of the play ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' by [[symbolist]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], in which she played the male role of Pelléas with the British actress [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Melissande.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=297–298}} She also starred in a new version of ''Adrienne Lecouvreur'', which she wrote herself, different from the earlier version which had been written for her by Scribe. During this time, she wrote a drama, ''Un Coeur d'Homme'', in which she had no part, which was performed at the Théâtre des Arts, but lasted only three performances.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=294}} She also taught acting briefly at the Conservatory, but found the system there too rigid and traditional. Instead, she took aspiring actresses and actors into her company, trained them, and used them as unpaid extras and bit players.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=292}}

[[File:Mme. Sarah Bernhardt in Phédre, Hearst Greek Theatre, May 17, '06, Act 3 LCCN2007663412.tif|thumb|upright=3.0|Bernhardt performing ''Phédre'' at [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] in Berkeley, California (May 1906)]]

Bernhardt made her first American Farewell Tour in 1905–1906, the first of four farewell tours she made to the US, Canada, and Latin America, with her new managers, the Shubert brothers. She attracted controversy and press attention when, during her 1905 visit to Montreal, the Roman Catholic bishop encouraged his followers to throw eggs at Bernhardt, because she portrayed prostitutes as sympathetic characters. The US portion of the tour was complicated due to the Shuberts' competition with the powerful syndicate of theater owners which controlled nearly all the major theaters and opera houses in the United States. The syndicate did not allow outside producers to use their stages. As a result, in Texas and Kansas City, Bernhardt and her company performed under an enormous circus tent, seating 4,500 spectators, and in skating rinks in Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa, and other cities. Her private train took her to Knoxville, Dallas, Denver, Tampa, Chattanooga, and Salt Lake City, then on to the West Coast. She could not play in San Francisco because of the recent [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but she performed across the bay in the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] at the University of California at Berkeley, and gave a recital, titled ''A Christmas Night during the Terror'', for inmates at San Quentin penitentiary.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=288–289}}

Her tour continued into South America, where it was marred by a more serious event: at the conclusion of ''La Tosca'' in Rio de Janeiro, she leaped, as always, from the wall of the fortress to plunge to her death in the Tiber. This time, however, the mattress on which she was supposed to land had been positioned incorrectly. She landed on her right knee, which had already been damaged in earlier tours. She fainted and was taken from the theater on a stretcher, but refused to be treated in a local hospital. She later sailed the few hours by ship from Rio to New York. When she arrived, her leg had swollen, and she was immobilized in her hotel for 15 days before returning to France.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=305–306}}

In 1906–1907, the French government finally awarded Bernhardt the Legion of Honor, but only in her role as a theater director, not as an actress. However, the award at that time required a review of the recipients' moral standards, and Bernhardt's behavior was still considered scandalous. Bernhardt ignored the snub and continued to play both inoffensive and controversial characters. In November 1906, she starred in ''La Vierge d'Avila, ou La Courtisan de Dieu'', by [[Catulle Mendes]], playing [[Saint Teresa of Ávila|Saint Theresa]], followed on 27 January 1907 by ''Les Bouffons'', by Miguel Zamocois, in which she played a young and amorous medieval lord.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=308–309}} In 1909, she again played the 19-year-old Joan of Arc in ''Le Procès de Jeanne d'Arc'' by [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]]. French newspapers encouraged schoolchildren to view her personification of French patriotism.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=295–96}}

Despite the injury to her leg, she continued to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=310}} In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born [[Lou Tellegen]], a very handsome actor who had served as a model for the sculpture ''Eternal Springtime'' by [[Auguste Rodin]], and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in ''Phedre'', where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of [[Judas Iscariot]] in ''Judas'' by the American playwright [[John Wesley De Kay]]. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Feilitzsch |first=Heribert |year=2012 |title=In Plain Sight: Felix A.

In April 1912, Bernhardt presented a new production in her theater, ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'', a romantic costume drama by Émile Moreau about [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s romances with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] and [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]]. It was lavish and expensive, but was a monetary failure, lasting only 12 performances. Fortunately for Bernhardt, she was able to pay off her debt with the money she received from the American producer [[Adolph Zukor]] for a film version of the play.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=318–319}} {{See below|1=Motion pictures}}

She departed on her third and last farewell tour of the United States in 1913–1914, when she was 69. Her leg had not yet fully healed, and she was unable to perform an entire play, only selected acts. She also separated from her co-star and lover of the time, Lou Tellegen. When the tour ended, he remained in the United States, where he briefly became a silent movie star, while she returned to France in May 1913.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=320}}

==Amputation of leg and wartime performances (1914–1918)==
In December 1913, Bernhardt performed another success with the drama ''Jeanne Doré''. On 16 March, she was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion d'Honneur]]. Despite her successes, she was still short of money. She had made her son Maurice the director of her new theater, and permitted him to use the receipts of the theater to pay his gambling debts, eventually forcing her to pawn some of her jewels to pay her bills.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=314–316}}

In 1914, she went as usual to her holiday home on [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]] with her family and close friends. There, she received the news of the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and the beginning of the [[First World War]]. She hurried back to Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that [[gangrene]] had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV style]], with white sides and gilded trim.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=318–320}}
 
She returned to Paris on 15 October, and, despite the loss of her leg, continued to go on stage at her theater; scenes were arranged so she could be seated, or supported by a prop with her leg hidden. She took part in a patriotic "scenic poem" by Eugène Morand, ''Les Cathédrals'', playing the part of Strasbourg Cathedral; first, while seated, she recited a poem; then she hoisted herself up on her one leg, leaned against the arm of the chair, and declared "Weep, weep, Germany! The German eagle has fallen into the Rhine!"{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=320}}

Bernhardt joined a troupe of famous French actors and traveled to the [[Battle of Verdun]] and the [[Battle of the Argonne]], where she performed for soldiers who were just returned or about to go into battle. Propped on pillows in an armchair, she recited her patriotic speech at Strasbourg Cathedral. Another actress present at the event, Beatrix Dussanne, described her performance: "The miracle again took place; Sarah, old, mutilated, once more illuminated a crowd by the rays of her genius. This fragile creature, ill, wounded and a immobile, could still, through the magic of the spoken word, re-instill heroism in those soldiers weary from battle."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=322}}

She returned to Paris in 1916 and made two short films on patriotic themes, one based on the story of Joan of Arc, the other called ''Mothers of France''. Then she embarked on her final American farewell tour. Despite the threat of German submarines, she crossed the Atlantic and toured the United States, performing in major cities including New York and San Francisco. Bernhardt was diagnosed with [[uremia]], and had to have an emergency kidney operation. She recuperated in Long Beach, California, for several months, writing short stories and novellas for publication in French magazines. In 1918, she returned to New York and boarded a ship to France, landing in Bordeaux on 11 November 1918, the day that the armistice was signed ending the First World War.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=326–327}}

==Final years (1919–1923)==
[[File:Bernhardt later years 2.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt in 1922]]

In 1920, she resumed acting in her theater, usually performing single acts of classics such as Racine's ''Athelee'', which did not require much movement. For her curtain calls, she stood, balancing on one leg and gesturing with one arm. She also starred in a new play, ''Daniel'', written by her grandson-in-law, playwright [[Louis Verneuil]]. She played the male lead role, but appeared in just two acts. She took the play and other famous scenes from her repertory on a European tour and then for her last tour of England, where she gave a special command performance for Queen Mary, followed by a tour of the British provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/03/sarah-bernhardt-in-london-the-best-of-samaritans/| title=Sarah Bernhardt in London, best of all possible Samaritans| author=Croxton, Arthur| work=The Fortnightly Review, fortnightlyreview.co.uk| date=26 March 2011| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625060357/http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/03/sarah-bernhardt-in-london-the-best-of-samaritans/| archivedate=25 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Bernhardt made her last tour of the French provinces, lecturing about theater and reciting the poetry of Rostand. Later that year, she produced a new play by Rostand, ''La Gloire'', and another play by Verneuil, ''Régine Arnaud'' in 1922. She continued to entertain guests at her home. One such guest, French author [[Colette]], described being served coffee by Bernhardt: "The delicate and withered hand offering the brimming cup, the flowery azure of the eyes, so young still in their network of fine lines, the questioning and mocking coquetry of the tilted head, and that indescribable desire to charm, to charm still, to charm right up to the gates of death itself."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=330}}

In 1922, she began rehearsing a new play by [[Sacha Guitry]], called ''Un Sujet de Roman.'' On the night of the dress rehearsal, she collapsed, going into a coma for an hour, then awakened with the words, "when do I go on?" She recuperated for several months, with her condition improving; she began preparing for a new role as Cleopatra in ''Rodogune'' by [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], and agreed to make a new film by Sasha Guitry called ''La Voyante'', for a payment of 10,000 francs a day. She was too weak to travel, so a room in her house on Boulevard Pereire was set up as a film studio, with scenery, lights, and cameras. However, on 21 March 1923, she collapsed again, and never recovered. She died from [[uremia]] on the evening of 26 March 1923. Newspaper reports stated she died "peacefully, without suffering, in the arms of her son".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Mme. Sarah Bernhardt |work=North-China Herald |date=31 March 1923 |page=866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, 30,000 people attended her funeral to pay their respects, and an enormous crowd followed her casket from the Church of Saint-Francoise-de-Sales to [[Pere Lachaise Cemetery]], pausing for a minute of silence outside her theater.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Bernhardt was one of the first actresses to star in moving pictures. The first projected film was shown by the [[Lumiere brothers]] at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. In 1900, the cameraman who had shot the first films for the Lumiere brothers, [[Clément Maurice]], approached Bernhardt and asked her to make a film out of a scene from her stage production of ''Hamlet''. The scene was Prince Hamlet's duel with Laertes, with Bernhardt in the role of Hamlet. Maurice made a phonograph recording at the same time, so the film could be accompanied by sound. The sound of the clashing wooden prop swords was not loud and realistic enough, so Maurice had a stage hand bang pieces of metal together in sync with the sword fight. Maurice's finished two-minute film, ''[[Hamlet (1900 film)|Le Duel d'Hamlet]]'', was presented to the public at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Universal Exposition]] between 14 April and 12 November 1900 in Paul Decauville's program, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre. This program contained short films of many other famous French theatre stars of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film|last=Duckett|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|isbn=9780252081163|location=|pages=Chapter 2: Hamlet, A Short Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound quality on the disks and the synchronization were very poor, so the system never became a commercial success. Nonetheless, her film is cited as one of the first examples of a sound film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isntlifeterrible.com/labels/film%20preservation.html|title=Filming Shakespeare With And Without Words In Settings Familiar And Unfamiliar|accessdate=18 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030131421/http://www.isntlifeterrible.com/labels/film%20preservation.html |archivedate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, in 1908, Bernhardt made a second motion picture, ''La Tosca''. This was produced by Le Film d’Art and directed by André Calmettes from the play by Victorien Sardou. The film has been lost. Her next film, with her co-star and lover Lou Tellegen, was ''La Dame aux Camelias'', called "Camille". When she performed on this film, Bernhardt changed both the fashion in which she performed, significantly accelerating the speed of her gestural action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film|last=Duckett|first=Victoria|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|isbn=9780252081163|location=|pages=Chapter 7. 'Mothers of France: World War 1, Film, and Propaganda.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a success in the United States, and in France, the young French artist and later screenwriter [[Jean Cocteau]] wrote, "What actress can play a lover better than she does in this film? No one!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=318}} Bernhardt received $30,000 for her performance.

Shortly afterwards, she made another film of a scene from her play ''Adrienne Levouvreur'' with Tellegen, in the role of Maurice de Saxe. Then, in 1912, the pioneer American producer [[Adolph Zukor]] came to London and filmed her performing scenes from her stage play ''Queen Elizabeth'' with her lover Tellegen, with Bernhardt in the role of Lord Essex.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=308–310}} To make the film more appealing, Zukor had the film print hand-tinted, making it one of the first color films. ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth|The Loves of Queen Elizabeth]]'' premiered at the Lyceum Theater in New York City on 12 July 1912, and was a financial success; Zukor invested $18,000 in the film and earned $80,000, enabling him to found the [[Famous Players Film Company]], which later became [[Paramount Pictures]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=318–19}} The use of the visual arts–specifically famous c.19 painting–to frame scenes and elaborate narrative action is significant in the work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bernhardt was also the subject and star of two documentaries, including ''Sarah Bernhardt à Belle-Isle'' (1915), a film about her daily life at home. This was one of the earliest films by a celebrity inviting us into the home, and is again significant for the use it makes of contemporary art references in the mis-en-scene of the film.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also made ''Jeanne Doré'' in 1916. This was produced by Eclipse and directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil from the play by Tristan Bernard. In 1917 she made a film called ''Mothers of France'' (''Mères Françaises''). Produced by Eclipse it was directed by Louis Mercanton and René Hervil with a screenplay by Jean Richepin. As Victoria Duckett explains in her book ''Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent Film'', this film was a propaganda film shot on the front line with the intent to urge America to join the War.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the weeks before her death in 1923, she was preparing to make another motion picture from her own home, ''La Voyante'', directed by Sacha Guitry. She told journalists, "They're paying me ten thousand francs a day, and plan to film for seven days. Make the calculation. These are American rates, and I don't have to cross the Atlantic! At those rates, I'm ready to appear in any films they make."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=350}} However, she died just before the filming began.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=332}}

==Painting and sculpture==
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt in Studio.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt with her bust of [[Medea]] in her sculpture studio in [[Montmartre]] (c. 1878)]]

Bernhardt began painting while she was at the Comédie-Française; since she rarely performed more than twice a week, she wanted a new activity to fill her time. Her paintings were mostly landscapes and seascapes, with many painted at Belle-Île. Her painting teachers were close and lifelong friends Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She exhibited a 2-m-tall canvas, ''The Young Woman and Death'', at the 1878 [[Paris salon|Paris Salon]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=115}}

Her passion for sculpture was more serious. Her sculpture teacher was Mathieu-Meusnier, an academic sculptor who specialized in public monuments and sentimental storytelling pieces.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=96}} She quickly picked up the techniques; she exhibited and sold a high-relief plaque of the death of Ophelia and, for the architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], she created the allegorical figure of ''Song'' for the group ''Music'' on the facade of the Opera House of [[Monte Carlo]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=114}} She also exhibited a group of figures, called ''Après la Tempête'' (''After the Storm''), at the 1876 Paris Salon, receiving an honorable mention. Bernhardt sold the original work, the molds, and signed plaster miniatures, earning more than 10,000 francs.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=114}} The original is now displayed the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] in Washington, DC. Fifty works by Bernhardt have been documented, of which 25 are known to still exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmwa.org/explore/collection-highlights/18th%E2%80%9319th-century 18th–19th Century | National Museum of Women in the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121230139/http://nmwa.org/explore/collection-highlights/18th%E2%80%9319th-century |date=21 January 2013 }}.

''Sarah Bernhardt's First American Theatrical Tour 1880–1881''. McFarland. {{ISBN|0786414952}}. p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; She set up a studio at 11 boulevard de Clichy in [[Montmartre]], where she frequently entertained her guests dressed in her sculptor's outfit, including white satin blouse and white silk trousers. Rodin dismissed her sculptures as "old-fashioned tripe", and she was attacked in the press for pursuing an activity inappropriate for an actress. She was defended by Emile Zola, who wrote, "How droll! Not content with finding her thin, or declaring her mad, they want to regulate her daily activities, ... Let a law be passed immediately to prevent the accumulation of talent!"{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=97–98}}

==''The Art of the Theater''==
In her final years, Bernhardt wrote a textbook on the art of acting. She wrote whenever she had time, usually between productions, and when she was on vacation at Belle-Île. After her death, the writer Marcel Berger, her close friend, found the unfinished manuscript among her belongings in her house on boulevard Pereire. He edited the book, and it was published as ''L'Art du Théâtre'' in 1923. An English translation was published in 1925.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=7–11}}

She paid particular attention to the use of the voice, "the instrument the most necessary to the dramatic artist." It was the element, she wrote, which connected the artist with the audience. "The voice must have all the harmonies, ... serious, plaintive, vibrant and metallic." For a voice to be fully complete, she wrote, "It is necessary that it be very slightly nasal. An artist who has a dry voice can never touch the public." She also stressed the importance for artists to train their breathing for long passages. She suggested that an actress should be able to recite the following passage from ''Phédre'' in a single breath:

::Hélas! ils se voyaient avec pleine licence,
::Le ciel de leurs soupirs approuvait l'innocence; 
::Ils suivaient sans remords leur penchant amoureux;
::Tous les jours se levaient clairs et sereins pour eux! {{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=50–51}}

She noted that "the art of our art is not to have it noticed by the public... We must create an atmosphere by our sincerity, so that public, gasping, distracted, should not regain its equilibrium and free will until the fall of the curtain. That which is called the work, in our art, should only be the search for the truth."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=65}}

She also insisted that artists should express their emotions clearly without words, using "their eye, their hand, the position of the chest, the tilting of the head... The exterior form of the art is often the entire art; at least, it is that which strikes the audience the most effectively." She encouraged actors to "Work, overexcite your emotional expression, become accustomed to varying your psychological states and translating them... The diction, the way of standing, the look, the gesture are predominant in the development of the career of an artist."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=66–67}}

She explained why she liked to perform male roles: "The roles of men are in general more intellectual than the roles of women... Only the role of Phédre gives me the charm of digging into a heart that is truly anguished... Always, in the theater, the parts played by the men are the best parts. And yet theater is the sole art where women can sometimes be superior to men."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|pages=116–119}}

==Memory and improvisation==
Bernhardt had a remarkable ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in ''L'Art du Théâtre'' that "I only have to read a role two or three times and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from ''Phèdre'' or ''Hamlet''. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}} She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of ''L'Etrangére'' at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}}

During another performance on her world tour, a backstage door was opened during a performance of ''Phèdre'', and a cold wind blew across the stage as Bernhardt was reciting. Without interrupting her speech, she added "If someone doesn't close that door I will catch pneumonia." The door was closed, and no one in the audience seemed to notice the addition.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2017|page=31}}

==Critical appraisals==
French drama critics praised Bernhardt's performances; Francisque Sarcey, an influential Paris critic, wrote of her 1871 performance in ''Marie'', "She has a sovereign grace, a penetrating charm, and I don't know what. She is a natural and an incomparable artist."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=91}} Reviewing her performance of ''Ruy Blas'' in 1872, the critic [[Théodore de Banville]] wrote that Bernhardt "declaimed like a bluebird sings, like the wind sighs, like the water murmurs."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}} Of the same performance, Sarcey wrote: "She added the music of her voice to the music of the verse. She sang, yes, sang with her melodious voice..."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}} 
 
Victor Hugo was a fervent admirer of Bernhardt, praising her "golden voice". Describing her performance in his play, ''Ruy Blas'' in 1872, he wrote in his ''Carnets'', "It is the first time this play has really been played! She is better than an actress, she is a woman. She is adorable; she is better than beautiful, she has the harmonious movements and looks of irresistible seduction."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=95}}
 
Her 1882 performance of ''Fédora'' was described by the French critic [[Maurice Baring]]: "A secret atmosphere emanated from her, an aroma, an attraction which was at once exotic and cerebral... She literally hypnotized the audience", and played "with such tigerish passion and feline seduction which, whether it be good or bad art, nobody has been able to match since."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=216–216}}

In 1884, [[Sigmund Freud]] saw Bernhardt perform ''Theodora'', writing:

{{Block quote|text="I cannot say much for the play, but this Sarah, how she played! From the moment I heard her first lines, pronounced in her vibrant and adorable voice, I had the feeling I had known her for years. None of the lines that she spoke could surprise me; I believed immediately everything that she said. The smallest centimeter of this character was alive and enchanted you. And then, there was the manner she had to flatter, to implore, to embrace. Her incredible positions, the manner in which she keeps silent, but each of her limbs and each of her movements play the role for her! Strange creature! It is easy for me to imagine that she has no need to be any different on the street than she is on the stage!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=210}}|sign=|source=}}

She also had her critics, particularly in her later years among the new generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote of the "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making you admire her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her wildly when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you."{{Sfn|Gold|Fizdale|1991}} [[Ivan Turgenev]] wrote: "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!"{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=188}}{{Sfn|Gottlieb|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=Leonard |title=Turgenev and his Times |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian dramatist [[Anton Chekhov]], then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=188}} He wrote that in her roles, "enchantment is smothered in artifice."{{Sfn|Gottlieb|2010}}

Sarah Bernhardt's performances were seen and appraised by many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the late 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] wrote, "There are five kinds of actresses. Bad actresses, fair actresses, good actresses, great actresses, and then there is Sarah Bernhardt." Oscar Wilde called her "the Incomparable One", scattered lilies in her path, and wrote a play in French, ''Salomé'', especially for her; it was banned by British censors before it could be performed.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=122}} Shortly before he died, Wilde wrote: "The three women I have most admired in my life are Sarah Bernhardt, [[Lily Langtry]], and Queen Victoria. I would have married any one of them with pleasure."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=123–124}}

After seeing a performance by Bernhardt in 1903, the British actress [[Ellen Terry]] wrote, "How marvelous Sarah Bernhardt was! She had the transparence of an azalea with even more delicacy, the lightness of a cloud with less thickness. Smoke from a burning paper describes her more nearly."{{sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=298}}

British author [[D.H. Lawrence]] saw Bernhardt perform ''La Dame aux Camelias'' in 1908. Afterward, he wrote to a friend:

{{Quote|text="Sarah was wonderful and terrible. Oh, to see her, and to hear her, a wild creature, a gazelle with a beautiful panther's fascination and fury, laughing in musical French, screaming with true panther cry, sobbing and sighing like a deer sobs, wounded to the death... She is not pretty, her voice is not sweet, but there is the incarnation of wild emotion that we share with all living things..."&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of D.H. Lawrence'', Volume 1, edited by James Boulton, Cambridge University Press  (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Personal life==
===Paternity, date of birth, ancestry, name===
The identity of Bernhardt's father is not known for certain. Her original birth certificate was destroyed when the [[Paris Commune]] burned the Hotel de Ville and city archives in May 1871. In her autobiography, ''Ma Double Vie'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2008708|title=Ma double vie : mémoires / de Sarah Bernhardt|first=Sarah (1844–1923) Auteur du texte|last=Bernhardt|date=25 August 2017|publisher=E. Fasquelle|via=gallica.bnf.fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807074613/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2008708|archivedate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; she describes meeting her father several times, and writes that his family provided funding for her education, and left a sum of 100,000 francs for her when she came of age.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000}} She said he frequently travelled overseas, and that when she was still a child, he died in Pisa "in unexplained circumstances which remain mysterious."{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000|page=67}} In February 1914, she presented a reconstituted birth certificate, which stated that her legitimate father was one Édouard Bernhardt.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=322}} On 21 May 1856, when she was baptized, she was registered as the daughter of "Edouard Bernhardt residing in Le Havre and Judith Van Hard, residing in Paris."{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=27}}

A more recent biography by Helene Tierchant (2009) suggests her father may have been a young man named De Morel, whose family members were notable shipowners and merchants in Le Havre. According to Bernhardt's autobiography, her grandmother and uncle in Le Havre provided financial support for her education when she was young, took part in family councils about her future, and later gave her money when her apartment in Paris was destroyed by fire.{{Sfn|Bernhardt|2000}}

Her date of birth is also uncertain due to the destruction of her birth certificate. She usually gave her birthday as 23 October 1844, and celebrated it on that day. However, the reconstituted birth certificate she presented in 1914 gave the date as 25 October.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=15}}{{sfn|Skinner|1967|page=1}} Other sources give the date 22 October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/sarah-bernhardt-9210057|title=Sarah Bernhardt|website=Biography.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425092034/http://www.biography.com/people/sarah-bernhardt-9210057|archivedate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or either 22 or 23 October.&lt;ref name="Sarah Bernhardt | French actress | Britannica.com" /&gt;

Bernhardt's mother Judith, or Julie, was born in the early 1820s. She was one of six children, five daughters and one son, of a Dutch-Jewish itinerant eyeglass merchant, Moritz Baruch Bernardt, and a German laundress,{{sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=14}} Sara Hirsch (later known as Janetta Hartog or Jeanne Hard). Judith's mother died in 1829, and five weeks later, her father remarried.{{Sfn|Snel|2007}} His new wife did not get along with the children from his earlier marriage. Judith and two of her sisters, Henriette and Rosine, left home, moved to London briefly, and then settled in Le Havre, on the French coast.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=14}} Henriette married a local in Le Havre, but Julie and Rosine became courtesans, and Julie took the new, more French name of Youle and the more aristocratic-sounding last name of Van Hard. In April 1843, she gave birth to twin girls to a "father unknown." Both girls died in the hospice in Le Havre a month later. The following year, Youle was pregnant again, this time with Sarah. She moved to Paris, to 5 rue de l'École-de-Médicine, where in October 1844, Sarah was born.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=13–15}}

===Lovers and friends===
Early in Bernhardt's career, she had an affair with a Belgian nobleman, Charles-Joseph Eugène Henri Georges Lamoral de Ligne (1837–1914), son of [[Eugène, 8th Prince of Ligne]], with whom she bore her only child, Maurice Bernhardt (1864–1928). Maurice did not become an actor, but worked for most of his life as a manager and agent for various theaters and performers, frequently managing his mother's career in her later years, but rarely with great success. Maurice and his family were usually financially dependent, in full or in part, on his mother until her death. Maurice married a [[Polish people|Polish]] princess, Maria Jablonowska, of the [[Jablonowski|House of Jablonowski]], with whom he had two daughters: Simone, who married Edgar Gross, son of a wealthy Philadelphia soap manufacturer; and Lysiana, who married the playwright Louis Verneuil.

From 1864 to 1866, after Bernhardt left the Comédie-Française, and after Maurice was born, she frequently had trouble finding roles. She often worked as a courtesan, taking wealthy and influential lovers. The French police of the Second Empire kept files on high-level courtesans, including Bernhardt; her file recorded the wide variety of names and titles of her patrons; they included the son of Spanish banker and Marquis [[Alejandro María Aguado, 1st Marquis of the Guadalquivir Marshes|Alexandro María Aguado]]; the industrialist Robert de Brimont; the banker Jacques Stern; and the wealthy Louis-Roger de Cahuzac.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=57}} The list also included [[Khalil Bey]], the Ambassador of the Ottoman Empire to the Second Empire, best known today as the man who commissioned [[Gustave Courbet]] to paint ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'', a detailed painting of a woman's anatomy that was banned until 1995, but now on display at the [[Musee d'Orsay]]. Bernhardt received from him a diadem of pearls and diamonds. She also had affairs with many of her leading men, and with other men more directly useful to her career, including Arsène Houssaye, director of the Théâtre-Lyrique, and the editors of several major newspapers. Many of her early lovers continued to be her friends after the affairs ended.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=58–59}}

During her time at the Odeon, she continued to see her old lovers, as well as new ones including French marshals François-Certain Canrobert and [[Achille Bazaine]], the later a commander of the French army in the Crimean War and in Mexico; and Prince Napoleon, son of Joseph Bonaparte and cousin of French Emperor [[Louis-Napoleon]]. She also had a two-year-long affair with Charles Haas, son of a banker and one of the most celebrated Paris [[dandies]] in the Empire, the model for the character of Swann in the novels by [[Marcel Proust]].{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|pages=71–73}}

Bernhardt took as lovers many of the male leads of her plays, including Mounet-Sully and Lou Tellegen. She possibly had an affair with the Prince of Wales, the future [[Edward VII]], who frequently attended her London and Paris performances and once, as a prank, played the part of a cadaver in one of her plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html| title=Edward VII biography| accessdate=18 October 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525070548/http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/EdwardVII.html | archivedate=25 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was King, he travelled on the royal yacht to visit her at her summer home on Belle-Île.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=273}}

Her last serious love affair was with the Dutch-born actor [[Lou Tellegen]], 37 years her junior, who became her co-star during her second American farewell tour (and eighth American tour) in 1910. He was a very handsome actor who had served as a model for sculpture ''[[Eternal Springtime]]'' by [[Auguste_Rodin|Rodin]]. He had little acting experience, but Bernhardt signed him as a leading man just before she departed on the tour, assigned him a compartment in her private railway car, and took him as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly good actor, and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles, such as Hippolyte in ''Phedre'', where he could take off his shirt. At the end of the American tour they had a dispute and he remained in the United States while she returned to France. At first, he had a successful career in the United States, and married film actress [[Geraldine Farrar]], but when they split up his career plummeted. He committed suicide in 1934.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=310–313}}

Bernhardt's broad circle of friends included the writers [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], his son [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas, ''fils'']], [[Emile Zola]], and the artist [[Gustave Doré]]. Her close friends included the painters [[Georges Clairin]] and [[Louise Abbéma]] (1853–1927), a French [[Impressionism|impressionist painter]], some nine years her junior. This relationship was so close, the two women were rumored to be lovers. In 1990, a painting by Abbéma, depicting the two on a boat ride on the lake in the bois de Boulogne, was donated to the Comédie-Française. The accompanying letter stated that the painting was ''"Peint par Louise Abbéma, le jour anniversaire de leur liaison amoureuse"''&lt;ref&gt;Guibert et al. (2000) ''Portrait(s) de Sarah Bernhardt''. Bibliothèque Nationale de France. {{ISBN|2717721134}}&lt;/ref&gt; (loosely translated: "Painted by Louise Abbéma on the anniversary of their love affair") Clairin and Abbéma spent their holidays with Bernhardt and her family at her summer residence at Belle-Île, and remained close with Bernhardt until her death.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=272-274}}

===Marriage with Jacques Damala===
[[File:Damala.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques Damala]] and [[Jane Hading]] in ''Le Maître des Forges'' at the [[Théâtre du Gymnase]], in Marseille (c. 1883)]]

In 1882, in Paris, Bernhardt met a Greek diplomat, Aristide Damala (known in France by his stage name Jacques Damala), who was 11 years her junior, and notorious for his romantic affairs. Bernhardt's biographer described him as "handsome as Adonis, insolent, vain, and altogether despicable."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=208}} His affairs with married women had already led to one suicide and two divorces, and the French government had asked him to leave Paris, transferring him to the Greek Embassy in St. Petersburg. She already had a lover at the time, Philippe Garnier, her leading man, but when she met Damala, she fell in love with him, and insisted that her tour be modified to include a stop in St. Petersburg. Garnier politely stepped aside and let her go to St. Petersburg without him. Arriving in St. Petersburg, Bernhardt invited Damala to give up his diplomatic post to become an actor in her company, as well as her lover, and before long, they decided to marry. During a break in the tour, they were married on 4 April 1882 in London. She told her friends that she married because marriage was the only thing she had never experienced.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=210–213}} Upon returning to Paris, she found a minor role for Damala in ''La Dame aux Camelias'' and a leading role in another play without her, ''Les Meres Ennemies'' by Catulle Mendés. Critics dismissed him as handsome, but without noticeable talent. Damala began taking large quantities of morphine, and following Bernhardt's great success in ''Fedora'', Damala took every opportunity to criticize and humiliate her. She later discovered that he was using the money she gave him to buy presents for other women. In early December 1882, when she confronted him, he declared that he was going to North Africa to join the Foreign Legion, and disappeared.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=208–214}}

[[File:Funerary Portrait of Jacques Damala MET DP224154.jpg|thumb|left|Funerary bust made of Damala by Sarah Bernhnardt (1889)]]
In early 1889, Damala reappeared at Bernhardt's door haggard, ill, and penniless. Bernhardt instantly forgave him, and offered him the role of Armand Duval in a new production of ''Dame aux Camélias'' at the Variétés. They performed together from 18 May until 30 June. He looked exhausted and old, confused his diction, and forgot his lines. The critic for ''Le Rappel'' wrote: "Where is, alas, the handsome Armand Duval who was presented to us for the first time a few years ago at the Gaiéte?" The critic Francisque Sarcey wrote simply, "he makes us feel sick." When his contract ended, he was able to get another contract as an actor at a different theater, and continued to harass Bernhardt. He attended one of her performances sitting in the first row, and made faces at her. Her current lover, Philippe Garnier, saw him and beat him. Later, he entered her house and ravaged the furniture. Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic, and did not want to divorce him.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=224}} He continued to act, sometimes with success, particularly in a play by [[Georges Ohnet]], ''Le Maître des Forges,'' in 1883. However, his morphine addiction continued to worsen. In August 1889, Bernhardt learned that he taken an overdose of morphine in Marseille. She hurried to his bedside and nursed him until he died on 18 August 1889, at the age of 34. He was buried in Athens. Bernhardt sent a bust she had made of him to be placed on his tomb, and when she toured in the Balkans, always made a detour to visit his grave. Until the end of her life, she continued to sign official documents as "Sarah Bernhardt, widow of Damala".{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=202}}

===Belle-Île===
[[File:Belle-Ile fort de Sarah Bernard juillet.jpg|thumb|Bernhardt's converted fort on [[Belle Île|Belle-Île]]]]

After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a small island off the coast of [[Brittany]], 10 miles south of the [[Quiberon]] peninsula. She purchased a ruined 17th-century fortress, located at the end of the island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned.{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|pages=237–279}} During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=258}}

===Religion===
Bernhardt attended a convent school, where she received her first communion as a Roman Catholic in 1856, and thereafter she was fervently religious. However, she never forgot her Jewish heritage. When asked years later by a reporter if she were a Christian, she replied: "No, I'm a Roman Catholic, and a member of the great Jewish race. I'm waiting until Christians become better."{{Sfn|Skinner|1967|page=13}} She accepted the [[last rites]] shortly before her death.&lt;ref&gt;[[David W. Menefee|Menefee, David W.]] (2003) ''Sarah Bernhardt in the Theater of Films and Sound Recordings''. North Carolina: McFarland. {{ISBN|078641636X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her request, her [[Funeral Mass]] was celebrated at the church of Saint-François-de-Sales, which she attended when she was in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/464490834|title=Sarah Bernhardt|last=1930–|first=Silverthorne, Elizabeth,|date=2004|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|isbn=9781438124162|location=Philadelphia|oclc=464490834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After Bernhardt's death, her theater was managed by her son Maurice until his death in 1928. It kept its name until the [[Paris in World War II|occupation of Paris]] by the Germans in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John (1995). "Bernhardt, Sarah" in ''The Cambridge Guide to the Theatre''. Martin Banham (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521434379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when, because of Bernhardt's Jewish ancestry, the name was changed to Théâtre de la Cité.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the article [[:fr:Théâtre de la Ville|Théâtre de la Ville]] in the French [[:fr:Wikipédia|Wikipédia]] ([http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Théâtre_de_la_Ville&amp;oldid=79700031 version 12 juin 2012 à 11:13]).&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed back to the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in 1947, then in 1957 became the Théâtre des Nations. In 1968, it was renamed the Théâtre de la Ville, which is the name it has today.

In 1876, Bernhardt constructed a large town house at 35 rue Fortuny in the 17th arrondissement, not far from Parc Monceau, for her family, servants, and animals. In 1885, when her debts mounted, she sold the house. Once her fortune was replenished by her tours abroad, she bought an even larger house at 56 avenue Pereire in the 17th arrondissement, where she died in 1923. The house was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a modern apartment building. A plaque on the facade commemorates Bernhardt's earlier residence.{{Sfn|Tierchant|2009|page=219}}

In 1960, Bernhardt was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] located at 1751 [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame – Sarah Bernhardt |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=16 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116142635/http://www.walkoffame.com/sarah-bernhardt |archivedate=16 November 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara|last=Isenberg|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt|title=Sarah Bernhardt|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=4 December 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725184019/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/sarah-bernhardt/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] produced [[Theresa Rebeck]]'s play ''Bernhardt/Hamlet''.  In the play, Rebeck explores the controversy surrounding Bernhardt's decision to play [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]].  The play opened on Broadway in September at the American Airlines Theater for a limited run.  It starred [[Janet McTeer]] as Bernhardt and it was directed by [[Moritz von Stuelpnagel]] . &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/bernhardt-hamlet-518406&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Sculptured stones''' is a name applied to commemorative monuments of [[early Christian]] date found in various parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]].

They are usually rough-hewn slabs or boulders, and in a few cases well-shaped crosses, bearing lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on [[Celt]]ic scriptures of the [[Gospels]]. Their lettered inscriptions are in [[Latin]], [[Ogam]] or [[Viking|Scandinavian]] and [[Angles|Anglican]] [[runes]], while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland]] are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pictishstones.org.uk/

In [[sewing]], '''shirring''' is two or more rows of [[gather (sewing)|gather]]s that are used to decorate parts of garments, usually the [[sleeve]]s, [[bodice]] or [[yoke (clothing)|yoke]].  The term is also sometimes used to refer to the [[pleats]] seen in [[Front curtain|stage curtains]].

In the construction of digital 3D clothing '''shirring''' can be accomplished by applying a Displacement map or Normal map when rendering the digital clothing models in a render engine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cgelves.com/how-to-create-a-shirring-effect-for-digital-3d-clothing-models/ How to Create Shirring for Digital 3D Clothing]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other|Singe (surname)}}
[[File:Bigot Boy Singeing Bat.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Boy singeing a [[bat]]'s wings'', by [[Trophime Bigot]]]]
A '''singe''' is a slight scorching, burn or treatment with flame. This may be due to an accident, such as scorching one's hair when lighting a [[gas fire]], or a deliberate method of treatment or removal of hair or other fibres.

==Hairdressing==
A singe is a treatment available at a [[barber]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Trade Training and Vocational Guidance|page=241|publisher=Preston School of Industry|year=1943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaZAAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=hair+singe+barber&amp;dq=hair+singe+barber|author1= Industry, Preston School of}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lit [[candle|taper]] (candle) or other device is used to lightly burn and shrivel the hair.  The practice of singeing was popular approximately a century ago; it was believed that hair had "fluid" in it and singeing would trap the fluid in.  Singeing is supposed to have beneficial effects – sealing cut ends, closing up the [[Hair follicle|follicle]]s, preventing the hair from bleeding (This belief has since been debunked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Art and Indianapolis Medical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7lXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|year=1918|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and encouraging it to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zone Reflex Plus Translation Diet: Hydro-Therapy and Swedish Massage|page=74|author1=Joe S. Riley |author2=W. E. Daglish |year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ST9Zc8TB54C|isbn=0-7873-1124-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Singeing is still sometimes used to bond natural hair to [[hair extensions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ayana Byrd|author2=Lori Tharps|title=Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpdqmtO2IycC&amp;pg=PA122|date=12 January 2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-28322-3|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive cultures have also used singeing as a means to trim scalp or body hair, as a part of normal grooming or during ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bret Harte|title=The Overland Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA419|year=1874|publisher=A.

[[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] was famously said to have figuratively "[[singed the King of Spain's beard]]" when he [[Francis Drake#Cadiz raid|raided Cadiz]] and burnt the Spanish fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Management of the Hirsute Woman|author=Jocelyn R. Rentoul| year=1983|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|volume=22|pages=265–272|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|pmid=6347918|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1983.tb02136.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
In the [[agricultural industry]], [[poultry]] and [[pork]] is singed to remove stub [[feather]]s and [[bristle]]s. Kiwifruit vine leaders and canes are sometimes cauterised as a treatment for ''[[Pseudomonas syringae]]'' bacterial infection.

== Textiles ==
{{see also|Heatsetting}}

In the [[textile industry]], loose fibres protruding on the surface of [[textile]] goods are singed to remove them.  When done to [[textile|fabric]]s containing [[cotton]], this results in increased wettability, better [[dyeing]] characteristics, improved reflection, no "frosty" appearance, a smoother surface, better clarity in printing, improved visibility of the fabric structure, less [[Pill (textile)|pilling]] and decreased contamination through removal of fluff and lint.

The process is usually to pass one or both sides of a fabric over a gas flame to burn off the protruding fibres. Other methods include [[infra-red]] or heat for [[thermoplastic]] fibers. Singeing of [[yarn]]s is called "''gassing''".  It is usually the first step after [[weaving]] or [[knitting]], though the fabric may be brushed first to raise the surface fibres.

Cellulose fibres such as cotton are easily singed because the protruding fibers burn to a light ash which is easily removed. Thermoplastic fibres are harder to singe because they melt and form hard residues on the fabric surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Strings of Freedom''' is an orchestra in the [[West Bank]] town of [[Jenin]]. It was founded by an Israeli Arab, Wafaa Younis, who travels regularly from her home in central Israel to teach music to children in Jenin.&lt;ref name='Concert'&gt;{{cite news | first = Isabel | last = Kershner | authorlink = Isabel Kershner | title = Concert for Holocaust Survivors Is Condemned | date = 2009-03-29 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/middleeast/30mideast.html | work = [[New York Times]] | accessdate = 2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holocaust survivor incident==
In 2009, Younis arranged for some of the young musicians to travel to [[Holon]], [[Israel]] to play for a concert for a group of [[Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref name='Concert'/&gt;

Following the concert in Holon, the house that Younis rented and used as a music studio was sealed and she was briefly barred form working in Jenin. The Popular Committee, "a grass-roots group representing the Palestine Liberation Organization," told journalists that said the young musicians had been exploited by the orchestra director, Wafaa Younis, for the purpose of “normalizing” ties with Israel. He told the New York Times that the children had been “deceived” and dragged unwittingly into a political situation that “served enemy interests” and aimed to “destroy the Palestinian national spirit in the camp.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Taranto | authorlink = James Taranto | title = Violence, Not Violins | date = 2009-03-30 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123836428386167255 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = 2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='jpost'&gt;{{cite news | title = PA dismantles W.

After a short period of time, Younis was allowed by the PA to return to the camp and continue teaching children and conducting the orchestra. In her words, "This is my family, here in the Jenin Camp. I love them so much and they love me back." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=adigal |url=http://historyviolins.blogspot.com/2009/07/we-are-muslims-god-created-us-to-have.html |title=History and Violins: "We are Muslims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61419">'''[[Molecular symmetry]]''' in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] describes the [[symmetry]] present in [[molecule]]s and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry. Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of [[Quantum Mechanics]] in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its [[molecular dipole moment|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[dipole]] moment and its allowed [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic transitions]] (based on [[selection rules]]), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). [[Group theory]] is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry.

Among all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze.

== Symmetry and group theory ==
The physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system.
* These [[symmetry]] operations can involve external or internal co-ordinates; giving rise to geometrical or internal symmetries. 
* These symmetry operations can be global or local; giving rise to global or gauge symmetries.
* These symmetry operations can be discrete or continuous.
Symmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]]s and gives insights about the matrix elements of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that [[Group theory]] is the most efficient way of doing this.

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}
A&amp;nbsp;''group''&amp;nbsp;is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (''G'',*)) consisting of a set&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;'*'&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
# '''&lt;u&gt;closure&lt;/u&gt;''': For every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;
x,y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;''product''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;

x*y\in G
&lt;/math&gt;''.''
# '''&lt;u&gt;associativity&lt;/u&gt;''': For every&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G'', both (''x''*''y'')*''z''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''x''*(''y''*''z'') result with the same element in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\forall x,y,z\in G&lt;/math&gt;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of identity&lt;/u&gt;''': There must be an element ( say&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product any element of&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;make no change to the element ( in symbols,&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
x*e=e*x=x;\forall x\in G&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
# '''&lt;u&gt;existence of inverse&lt;/u&gt;''': For each element (&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;) in&amp;nbsp;''G'', there must be an element&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;such that product of&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;is the identity element&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp; ( in symbols, for each &lt;math&gt;
x\in G
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\text{ }\exists \text{ }y\in G
&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x=e
&lt;/math&gt;).
* In addition to the above four, if it so happens that &lt;math&gt;
\forall x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;
x*y=y*x
&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the operation in '''commutative,''' then the group is called an [[Abelian Group]]. Otherwise it is called a [[Non-abelian group|Non-Abelian Group]].

=== Groups, symmetry and conservation  ===
{{Main|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}The set of all symmetry transformations of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some [[Hermitian operator]] . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the '[[Generating set of a group|generators]]' of the [[symmetry group]]. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some [[Hilbert space]] in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Unitary operator|unitary symmetry operator]] and acts on the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then;

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;[H,U]=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {H}'={{U}^{\dagger }}HU=H \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow HU=UH \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow [H,U]=0;\forall U\in G \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

These operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group: 
* The symmetry operations are closed under multiplication. 
* Application of symmetry transformations are associative.
* There is always a trivial transformation, where nothing is done to the original co-ordinates. This is the identity element of the group. 
* And as long as an inverse transformation exists, it is a symmetry transformation, i.e. it leaves the Hamiltonian invariant. Thus the inverse is part of this set. 
So, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which [[commutator|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian, and they form a [[symmetry group]]. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]]). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it.

It follows that the generator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! The observable corresponding to the generator Hermitian matrix, is conserved.
|-
| The derivative of the expectation value of the operator T can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{d\left\langle \Psi |T|\Psi  \right\rangle }{dt}=\left\langle \frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t}|T|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \Psi |T|\frac{\partial \Psi }{\partial t} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now,

&lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \left| \Psi  \right\rangle }{\partial t}=H\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=-\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |HT|\Psi  \right\rangle +\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle \Psi |TH|\Psi  \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

as H is also Hermitian. So we have,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=\frac{1}{i\hbar }\left\langle [H,T] \right\rangle +\left\langle \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;[H,T]=0 &lt;/math&gt; as stated above, and if the operator T does not have any explicit time-dependence;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left\langle T \right\rangle }{dt}=0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \left\langle T \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is a constant, independent of what the state &lt;math&gt;\left| \Psi  \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may be.

So the observable corresponding to the operator T, is conserved.
|}
Some specific examples can be systems having [[Rotational symmetry|rotational]], [[translational invariance]] etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has [[axial symmetry]]), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; (general group element &lt;math&gt;R(\alpha )={{e}^{\frac{-i\alpha {{L}_{z}}}{\hbar }}}
&lt;/math&gt;). Thus, &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on.

== Geometrical symmetries ==

=== Symmetry operations, point groups and permutation-inversion groups ===
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
A molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain [[point group]] which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and [[improper rotation]] or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name [[point group]]. One  can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H.C. | year = 1963 | title = The symmetry groups of non-rigid molecules | url = | journal = Molecular Physics | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 445–460 | doi = 10.1080/00268976300100501 | bibcode = 1963MolPh...6..445L }}&lt;/ref&gt;. See the Section "Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry" below, and [https://chemphys.ca/pbunker/PointGroupspdffile.html Link] 
.  The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in [[crystallography]], where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as [[space group]]s.

=== Basic point group symmetry operations ===
The five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:&lt;ref&gt;http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/script/redirect.cgi?filename=http://csi.chemie.tu-darmstadt.de/ak/immel/tutorials/symmetry/index1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Identity Operation&amp;nbsp;E '''(from the German 'Einheit' meaning unity)''':'' '''''The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged. It forms the identity element in the symmetry group. Though its inclusion seems to be trivial, it is important also because even for the most asymmetric molecule, this symmetry is present. The corresponding symmetry element is the entire molecule itself. 
# '''Inversion, ''i '': '''This operation inverts the molecule about its center of inversion (if it has any). The center of inversion is the symmetry element in this case. There may or may not be an atom at this center. A molecule may or may not have a center of inversion. For example: the benzene molecule, a cube, and spheres do have a center of inversion, whereas a tetrahedron does not.
# '''Reflection σ: '''The&amp;nbsp;reflection&amp;nbsp;operation produces a mirror image geometry of the molecule about a certain plane. The&amp;nbsp;mirror plane&amp;nbsp;bisects the molecule and must include its center of geometry. The plane of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A symmetry plane&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;with the principal axis (defined below)  is dubbed&amp;nbsp;vertical&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) and one perpendicular to it horizontal&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;). A third type of symmetry plane exists: If a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed&amp;nbsp;dihedral&amp;nbsp;(σ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;).
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation&amp;nbsp;'''&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;''''': '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold rotation&amp;nbsp;operation about a&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of symmetry&amp;nbsp; produces molecular orientations indistinguishable from the initial for each rotation of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; (clockwise and counter-clockwise).It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The axis of symmetry is the symmetry element in this case. A molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;is called the&amp;nbsp;'''principal axis''', and by convention is assigned the z-axis in a&amp;nbsp;Cartesian coordinate system.
# '''''n''-Fold Rotation-Reflection&amp;nbsp;or improper rotation ''S&lt;sub&gt;n &lt;/sub&gt;: '''''The&amp;nbsp;n-fold improper rotation operation about an&amp;nbsp;n-fold axis of improper rotation is composed of two successive geometry transformations: first, a rotation through &lt;math&gt;
\frac{{{360}^{0}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;about the axis of that rotation, and second, reflection through a plane perpendicular (and through the molecular center of geometry) to that axis. This axis is the symmetry element in this case. It is abbreviated S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.
It is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations.

=== Schoenflies notation ===
{{Main|Schoenflies notation}}
The&amp;nbsp;'''Schoenflies'''&amp;nbsp;(or&amp;nbsp;'''Schönflies''')&amp;nbsp;'''notation''', named after the&amp;nbsp;German&amp;nbsp;mathematician&amp;nbsp;[[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], is one of two conventions commonly used to describe&amp;nbsp;point groups. This notation is used in&amp;nbsp;spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group.

== Point groups for diatomic molecules ==
{{Main|Molecular symmetry}}
There are two point groups for diatomic molecules: &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; for heteronuclear diatomics, and &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}
&lt;/math&gt; for homonuclear diatomics.
* &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt;:
The group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;, contains rotations &lt;math&gt;
C(\phi )
&lt;/math&gt; through any angle &lt;math&gt;
\phi 
&lt;/math&gt; about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''v''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').In the group &lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt; all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections &lt;math&gt;
{{\sigma }_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements &lt;math&gt;
C(\pm \phi )
&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this group is '''''Non-abelian''''' and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows:

{{D}_{\infty h}}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from those of the group &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/u&gt; using the relation between the two groups: &lt;math&gt;
{{D}_{\infty h}}={{C}_{\infty v}}\times {{C}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Like &lt;u&gt;&lt;math&gt;
{{C}_{\infty v}}

== Complete set of commuting operators ==
{{Main|Complete set of commuting observables}}
Unlike a single atom, the Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule doesn't commute with &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. So the quantum number &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is no longer a [[good quantum number]]. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead, &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{J}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the ''Z'' axis). But &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{x}},{{L}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; do not commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the ''Z'' axis), but not under rotations about the ''X'' or ''Y'' axes. Again, &lt;math&gt;{{S}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{S}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (''X-Z'') plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation &lt;math&gt;{{y}_{i}}\to -{{y}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; is the operator that performs this reflection, then &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;. So the [[Complete set of commuting observables|Complete Set of Commuting Operators]] (CSCO) for a general [[Heteronuclear molecule|heteronuclear diatomic molecule]] is &lt;math&gt;\{H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A\}&lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (''x or y). ''

In the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{16}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{O}^{18}}&lt;/math&gt;, and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation &lt;math&gt;{{\vec{r}}_{i}}\to -{{\vec{r}}_{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the parity operator &lt;math&gt;\Pi &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the CSCO for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is &lt;math&gt;\left\{ H,\text{ }{{J}_{z}},{{L}_{z}},{{S}^{2}},{{S}_{z}},A,\text{ }\Pi  \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==&lt;nowiki/&gt;Molecular term symbol, Λ-doubling ==
{{main|Molecular term symbol}}
'''[[Molecular term symbol]]'''&amp;nbsp;is a shorthand expression of the&amp;nbsp;group representation&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;angular momenta&amp;nbsp;that characterize the state of a&amp;nbsp;molecule. It is the equivalent of the&amp;nbsp;[[term symbol]]&amp;nbsp;for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the [[good quantum number]]s can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule. Here, the symmetry is explicitly stated in the nomenclature.

=== Angular momentum ===

Here, the system is not spherically symmetric. So, &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}^{2}}]\ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, and the state cannot be depicted in terms of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;{{L}^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt; anymore (in contrast to the atomic term symbol, where the states were written as &lt;math&gt;^{2S+1}{{L}_{J}}&lt;/math&gt;). But, as &lt;math&gt;[H,{{L}_{z}}]= 0&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenvalues corresponding to &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}&lt;/math&gt; can still be used. If,

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle ={{M}_{L}}\hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;{{M}_{L}}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,.......... \\ 
 &amp; \Rightarrow {{L}_{z}}\left| \Psi  \right\rangle =\pm \Lambda \hbar \left| \Psi  \right\rangle ;\Lambda =0,1,2,........... \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =\left| {{M}_{L}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value (in a.u.) of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis; &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a term symbol. By analogy with the spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, ... used for atoms, it is customary to associate code letters with the values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; according to the correspondence:
[[File:term1.gif|center|300x300px]]

For the individual electrons, the notation and the correspondence used are:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda =\left| {{m}_{l}} \right|&lt;/math&gt; and
[[File:term2.gif|center|300x300px]]

=== Axial symmetry ===

Again, &lt;math&gt;[{{A}_{y}},H]=0&lt;/math&gt;, and in addition: &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}{{L}_{z}}=-{{L}_{z}}{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; [as &lt;math&gt;{{L}_{z}}=-i\hbar (x\frac{\partial }{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial }{\partial x})&lt;/math&gt;]. It follows immediately that if &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; the action of the operator &lt;math&gt;{{A}_{y}}&lt;/math&gt; on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; converts this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\Lambda \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, and that both eigenstates have the same energy. The electronic terms such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the terms &lt;math&gt;\Pi ,\Delta ,\Phi ,................&lt;/math&gt;) are thus doubly degenerate, each value of the energy corresponding to two states which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis. This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; into two nearby levels, which is called &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;'''''-doubling'''''.&lt;ref name="Bransden"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When &lt;math&gt;\Lambda=0&lt;/math&gt;, simultaneous eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{{L}}_{{z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed. Since &lt;math&gt;A_{y}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions of &lt;math&gt;{{A}}_{{y}}&lt;/math&gt; have eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;. So to completely specify &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; states of diatomic molecules, &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; states, which  is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}&lt;/math&gt; states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation.

=== Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry ===

Homonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation '''''i''''' of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation '''''i''''', or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by '''''i'''''. The former are denoted by the subscript '''''g''''' and are called '''''gerade, '''''while the latter are denoted by the subscript '''''u''''' and are called '''''ungerade.''''' The subscripts '''''g''''' or '''''u''''' are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }_{g}},{{\Sigma }_{u}},{{\Pi }_{g}},{{\Pi }_{u}},......&lt;/math&gt; electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; electronic states: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _{g}^{+},\Sigma _{g}^{-},\Sigma _{u}^{+},\Sigma _{u}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;. Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group.

The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label '''''+''''' or '''''-'''''. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation
of permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels 
gain the additional label '''''s''''' or '''''a''''' depending on whether the total wavefunction is
unchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled '''''+''''' or '''''-''''', whereas those of homonuclear diatomic
molecules are labelled '''''+s''''', '''''+a''''', '''''-s''''' or '''''-a'''''. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen (2005), ''Fundamentals of Molecular Symmetry'' (Institute of Physics Publishing) {{ISBN|0-7503-0941-5}} Section 8.3.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules)
does not commute with the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states (called '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' mixing) and give
rise to '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' transitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pique | first = J.

=== [[Spin (physics)|Spin]] and [[total angular momentum]] ===

If '''''S '''''denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins, &lt;math&gt;s(s+1){{\hbar }^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of '''''S '''''and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of '''''S'''''. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; associated with each &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for a given &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;. Just as for atoms, the quantity &lt;math&gt;2s+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as &lt;math&gt;{}^{2s+1}\Lambda &lt;/math&gt;. For example, the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}^{3}\Pi &lt;/math&gt;denotes a term such that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =2
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=1
&lt;/math&gt;. It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol &lt;math&gt;X
&lt;/math&gt;) of most diatomic molecules is such that &lt;math&gt;s=0
&lt;/math&gt; and exhibits maximum symmetry. Thus, in most cases it is a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt;, excited states are written with &lt;math&gt;A,B,C,...&lt;/math&gt; in front) for a heteronuclear molecule and a &lt;math&gt;{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt; state (written as &lt;math&gt;X{}^{1}\Sigma _{g}^{+}
&lt;/math&gt;) for a homonuclear molecule.

Spin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the ''z''-component of spin interacts with the ''z''-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. This is characterized by the quantum number &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}={{M}_{S}}+{{M}_{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;. Again, positive and negative values of &lt;math&gt;{{M}_{J}}
&lt;/math&gt; are degenerate, so the pairs (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (−''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', −''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') are degenerate. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''M&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'') for which ''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is positive: &lt;math&gt;\Omega =\Lambda +{{M}_{S}}

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Molecular term symbol ===

So, the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule is given by:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{2S+1}\!\Lambda^{(+/-)}_{\Omega,(g/u)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* '''''S '''''is the total spin quantum number
* &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega

&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis
* '''''u'''''/'''''g''''' is the effect of the point group operation '''''i'''''
* '''''+/&amp;#x2212;''''' is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis

{{main|Avoided crossing}}

=== Effect of symmetry on the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ===
The electronic terms or potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{S}}(R)&lt;/math&gt; of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, and it is important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curves as R varies.It is of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curves representing the different terms.
[[File:wigner2014.png|thumb|258x258px|The non-crossing rule of von Neumann and Wigner. Two potential curves &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; cannot cross if the states 1 and 2 have the same point group symmetry]]
Let &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; two different electronic potential curves. If they intersect at some point, then the functions &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; will have neighbouring values near this point. To decide whether such an intersection can occur, it is convenient to put the problem as follows. Suppose at some internuclear distance &lt;math&gt;{{R}}_{{c}}
&lt;/math&gt; the values &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are close, but distinct (as shown in the figure). Then it is to be examined whether or &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; can be made to intersect by the modification &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}\to {{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt;. The energies &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}={{E}_{1}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2}^{(0)}={{E}_{2}}({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{0}}=H({{R}_{C}})
&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and are assumed to be real.
The Hamiltonian now becomes &lt;math&gt;H\equiv H({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)={{H}_{0}}+H'
&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H'=\frac{\partial {{H}_{0}}}{\partial {{R}_{C}}}\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; is the small perturbation operator (though it is a degenerate case, so ordinary method of perturbation won't work). setting &lt;math&gt;H_{ij}^{'}=\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|H'|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ;i,j=1,2
&lt;/math&gt;, it can be deduced that in order for &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{2}}(R)
&lt;/math&gt; to be equal at the point &lt;math&gt;{{R}_{C}}+\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; the following two conditions are required to be fulfilled:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|As an initial zero-order approximation, instead of &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; themselves, linear combinations of them of the form &lt;math&gt;\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle ={{c}_{1}}\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, can be taken as the [[eigenstate]] of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are, in general, complex). Substituting this expression in the perturbed  [[Schroedinger's equation|Schrödinger'''&amp;nbsp;''' equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;({{H}_{0}}+H')\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle =E\left| {{\Phi }^{(0)}} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking inner product with the respective bra's:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{1}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle +{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H'-E)\left\langle \Phi _{2}^{(0)}|\Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle =0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to different [[eigenvalues]] and as &lt;math&gt;
{{H}_{0}}
&lt;/math&gt; is itself Hermitian, They are [[orthonormal]]: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle \Phi _{i}^{(0)}|\Phi _{j}^{(0)} \right\rangle ={{\delta }_{ij}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}(E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E)+{{c}_{2}}H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;; and

&lt;math&gt;
{{c}_{1}}H_{21}^{'}+{{c}_{2}}(E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E)=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the operator &lt;math&gt;
H'
&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian, the matrix elements &lt;math&gt;
H_{11}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
H_{22}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; are real, while &lt;math&gt;
H_{12}^{'}=H_{21}^{'*}
&lt;/math&gt;. The compatibility condition for these equations is (such that both &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{c}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; are not simultaneously zero):

&lt;math&gt;
\left| \begin{matrix}
   E_{1}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-E &amp; H_{12}^{'}  \\
   H_{21}^{'} &amp; E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{22}^{'}-E  \\
\end{matrix} \right|=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This gives: &lt;math&gt;
E=\frac{1}{2}(E_{1}^{(0)}+E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}+H_{22}^{'})\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}{{(E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'})}^{2}}+{{\left| H_{12}^{'} \right|}^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives the required eigenvalues of the energy in the first approximation.

If the energy values of the two terms become equal at the point &lt;math&gt;({{R}_{C}}+\Delta R)
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the terms intersect), this means that the two values of &lt;math&gt;E
&lt;/math&gt; given by formula, are the same. For this to happen, the expression under the radical must vanish. Since it is the sum of two squares, both are simultaneously zero. So, it gives the conditions:

&lt;math&gt;E_{1}^{(0)}-E_{2}^{(0)}+H_{11}^{'}-H_{22}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

'''''and '''''

&lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

|}
However, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; giving the perturbation &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the

two conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; real, implies that &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; is also real). So, two case can arise:&amp;nbsp;
# The matrix element &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically. It is then possible to satisfy the first condition independently. Therefore, it is possible for the crossing to occur if, for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., for a certain value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;) the first equation is satisfied. As the perturbation operator &lt;math&gt;H'
&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;H
&lt;/math&gt;) commutes with the symmetry operators of the molecule, this case will happen if the two electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;  have different point group symmetries (for example if they correspond to two electronic terms having different values of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda 
&lt;/math&gt;, different electronic parities '''''g''''' and '''''u''''', different multiplicities, or for example are the two terms &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{\Sigma }^{-}}
&lt;/math&gt; ) as it can be shown that, for a scalar quantity whose operator commutes with the angular momentum and inversion operators, only the matrix elements for transitions between states of the same angular momentum and parity are non-zero and the proof remains valid, in essentially the same form, for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator. &amp;nbsp;
# If  the electronic states &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; have the same point group symmetry, then &lt;math&gt;H_{12}^{'}
&lt;/math&gt; can be, and will in general be, non-zero. Except for accidental crossing which would occur if, by coincidence, the two equations were satisfied at the same value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;, it is in general impossible to find a single value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta R
&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a single value of &lt;math&gt;R
&lt;/math&gt;)  for which the two conditions are satisfied simultaneously. &amp;nbsp;
Thus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as '''[[von Neumann]] - [[Wigner]] non-crossing rule. '''
{{#tag:ref| This follows from a more general rule of group theory. In the terminology of group theory, the general condition for the possible intersection of terms is that the terms should belong to different [[irreducible representations]] (irreps) of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian of the system.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{Cite book

This general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra.
In fact, in the applications of [[Valence bond theory|valence bond method]] in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the [[Atomic orbital|atomic]] and the [[molecular orbitals]] are taken care of:
# Molecular orbitals having a given value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (the component of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis) must connect with atomic orbitals having the same value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the same value of &lt;math&gt;\left| m \right|&lt;/math&gt;).
# The electronic parity of the wave function (''g'' or ''u'') must be preserved as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
# The von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule must be obeyed, so that energy curves corresponding to orbitals having the same symmetry do not cross as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; varies from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory.

== Observable consequences==
Symmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular [[Spectral line|spectra]] of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are:

=== [[Rotational spectrum]] ===
In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the [[electric dipole]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment.
In homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum.
Heteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules for a rotational transition are: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the selection rules become: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  &amp; \Delta \Im =0,\pm 1 \\ 
 &amp; \Delta {{M}_{\Im }}=0,\pm 1 \\ 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;.This is due to the fact that although the photon absorbed or emitted carries one unit of angular momentum, the nuclear rotation can change, with no change in &lt;math&gt;\Im  &lt;/math&gt;, if the electronic angular momentum makes an equal and opposite change. Symmetry considerations require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is directed along the internuclear line, and this leads to the additional selection rule &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Lambda =0 &lt;/math&gt;.The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infra-red or the microwave region, the frequencies of these lines given by:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }_{\Im +1,\Im }}={{E}_{r}}(\Im +1)-{{E}_{r}}(\Im )=2B(\Im +1) &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;B=\frac{{{\hbar }^{2}}}{2\mu R_{0}^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Im \ge \Lambda  &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;N.B.&lt;/u&gt;''' In exceptional circumstances the hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' vibronic states of homonuclear diatomic molecules giving rise to pure rotational ('''''ortho''''' - '''''para''''') transitions in a homonuclear diatomic molecule.&lt;ref name=Critchley2001/&gt;

=== [[Vibrational spectrum]] ===
The transition matrix elements for pure vibrational transition are &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu 
 &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Because the dipole moment depends on the bond length &lt;math&gt;R &lt;/math&gt;, its variation with displacement of the nuclei from equilibrium can be expressed as: &lt;math&gt;\mu ={{\mu }_{0}}+{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}x+\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}{{x}^{2}}+....... &lt;/math&gt;; where &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{0}} &lt;/math&gt; is the dipole moment when the displacement is zero. The transition matrix elements are, therefore: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{\mu }_{0}}\left\langle v'|v \right\rangle +{{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +.......={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle +\frac{1}{2}{{(\frac{{{d}^{2}}\mu }{d{{x}^{2}}})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|{{x}^{2}}|v \right\rangle +....... &lt;/math&gt;using orthogonality of the states. So, the transition matrix is non-zero only if the molecular dipole moment varies with displacement, for otherwise the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\mu &lt;/math&gt; would be zero. The gross selection rule for the vibrational transitions of diatomic molecules is then: ''To show a vibrational spectrum, a diatomic molecule must have a dipole moment that varies with extension. So, ''homonuclear diatomic molecules do not undergo electric-dipole vibrational transitions. So, a homonuclear diatomic molecule doesn't show purely vibrational spectra.

For small displacements, the electric dipole moment of a molecule can be expected to vary linearly with the extension of the bond. This would be the case for a heteronuclear molecule in which the partial charges on the two atoms were independent of the internuclear distance. In such cases (known as harmonic approximation), the quadratic and higher terms in the expansion can be ignored and &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}}=\left\langle v'|\mu |v \right\rangle ={{(\frac{d\mu }{dx})}_{0}}\left\langle v'|x|v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. Now, the matrix elements can be expressed in position basis in terms of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions: Hermite polynomials. Using the property of Hermite polynomials: &lt;math&gt;2(\alpha x){{H}_{v}}(\alpha x)=2v{{H}_{v-1}}(\alpha x)+{{H}_{v+1}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, it is evident that &lt;math&gt;x\left| v \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;x{{H}_{v}}(\alpha x) &lt;/math&gt;, produces two terms, one proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left| v+1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; and the other to &lt;math&gt;\left| v-1 \right\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;. So, the only non-zero contributions to &lt;math&gt;{{\mu }_{v,v'}} &lt;/math&gt; comes from &lt;math&gt;v'=v\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;. So, the selection rule for heteronuclear diatomic molecules is: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Homonuclear diatomic molecules show no pure vibrational spectral lines, and the vibrational spectral lines of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are governed by the above-mentioned selection rule.

=== [[Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy|Rovibrational spectrum]] ===
{{main|Rotational–vibrational spectroscopy}}
Homonuclear diatomic molecules show neither pure vibrational nor pure rotational spectra. However, as the absorption of a [[photon]] requires the molecule to take up one unit of [[angular momentum]], vibrational transitions are accompanied by a change in rotational state, which is subject to the same selection rules as for the pure rotational spectrum. For a molecule in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, the transitions between two vibration-rotation (or ''rovibrational'') levels &lt;math&gt;(v,\Im )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(v',\Im' )&lt;/math&gt;, with vibrational quantum numbers &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v' = v + 1&lt;/math&gt;, fall into two sets according to whether &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt;. The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =+1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''R branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{R}}=E(v+1,\Im +1)-E(v,\Im )=2B(\Im +1)+\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =0,1,2,......&lt;/math&gt;

The set corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =-1&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''P branch'''''. The corresponding frequencies are given by:  &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{P}}=E(v+1,\Im -1)-E(v,\Im )=-2B\Im +\hbar {{\omega }_{0}};\text{ }\Im =1,2,3,......&lt;/math&gt;

Both branches make up what is called a ''rotational-vibrational band or a rovibrational band''. These bands are in the [[infra-red]] part of the spectrum.

If the molecule is not in a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma &lt;/math&gt; state, so that &lt;math&gt;\Lambda \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;, transitions with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \Im =0&lt;/math&gt; are allowed. This gives rise to a further branch of the vibrational-rotational spectrum, called the '''''Q branch'''''. The frequencies &lt;math&gt;{{\omega }^{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the lines in this branch are given by a quadratic function of &lt;math&gt;\Im 
&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}&lt;/math&gt; are unequal, and reduce to the single frequency: &lt;math&gt;\hbar {{\omega }^{Q}}=E(v+1,\Im )-E(v,\Im )=\hbar {{\omega }_{0}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;{{B}_{v+1}}={{B}_{v}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, this selection rule has two consequences:  
# Both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers must change. The Q-branch is therefore forbidden.
# The energy change of rotation can be either subtracted from or added to the energy change of vibration, giving the P- and R- branches of the spectrum, respectively.
Homonuclear diatomic molecules also show this kind of spectra. The selection rules, however, are a bit different.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;''' Both homo- and hetero-nuclear diatomic molecules show rovibrational spectra. A Q-branch is absent in the spectra of heteronuclear diatomic molecules.

== A special example: Hydrogen molecule ion  ==
{{Main|Dihydrogen cation}}An explicit implication of symmetry on the molecular structure can be shown in case of the simplest bi-nuclear system: a hydrogen molecule ion or a di-hydrogen cation, &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. A natural trial wave function for the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by first considering the lowest-energy state of the system when the two protons are widely separated. Then there are clearly two possible states: the electron is attached either to one of the protons, forming a hydrogen atom in the [[ground state]], or the electron is attached to the other proton, again in the ground state of a hydrogen atom (as depicted in the picture). 
[[File:Two possible initial states of the system.png|thumb|484x484px|Two possible initial states of the system]]
The trial states in the position basis (or the '[[wave functions]]') are then:

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{1} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}-\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{2} \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}{{e}^{-\frac{\left| \mathbf{r}+\frac{\mathbf{R}}{2} \right|}{{{a}_{0}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; using variational method starts assuming these forms. Again, this is only one possible combination of states. There can be other combination of states also, for example, the electron is in an excited state of the hydrogen atom. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system is:

&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, using the states &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; as basis will introduce off-diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian. Here, because of the relative simplicity of the &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; ion, the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix elements]] can actually be calculated. The electronic Hamiltonian of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; commutes with the  point group inversion symmetry operation '''''i'''''. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:
{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The diagonal terms:
&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{11}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{1}} &lt;/math&gt;is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.

Again,&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{22}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{22}}={{E}_{1}}-\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}={{H}_{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the last step follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt;{{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|2 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}={{\left| \left\langle \mathbf{r}|1 \right\rangle  \right|}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}&lt;/math&gt; and from the symmetry of the system, the value of the integrals are same.

Now the off-diagonal terms:

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}=\left\langle 1|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle -\left\langle 1|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|2 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{12}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

by inserting a complete set of states &lt;math&gt;\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|&lt;/math&gt; in the last term. &lt;math&gt;\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle =\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\left\langle 1\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is called the 'overlap integral'

And,

&lt;math&gt;{{H}_{21}}=\left\langle 2|\frac{{{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}}{2{{m}_{e}}}-\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle -\left\langle 2|\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}|1 \right\rangle +\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R}\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow {{H}_{21}}=({{E}_{1}}+\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{R})\left\langle 2|1 \right\rangle -\int{{{d}^{3}}r}\frac{{{e}^{2}}}{\left| \mathbf{r}+\mathbf{R}/2 \right|}\left\langle 2\left| \mathbf{r} \right\rangle \left\langle  \mathbf{r} \right|1 \right\rangle ={{H}_{12}}&lt;/math&gt; (as the wave functions are real)

So, &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}\text{ and }{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;

|}
Because &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{11}}={{H}_{22}}&lt;/math&gt; as well as &lt;math&gt;{{H}_{12}}={{H}_{21}}&lt;/math&gt;, the linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\left| 1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;\left| 2 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; that [[Diagonalized|diagonalizes]] the Hamiltonian is &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pm 2\left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }}(\left| 1 \right\rangle \pm \left| 2 \right\rangle )&lt;/math&gt; (after normalization). Now as &lt;math&gt;[H,&lt;/math&gt;'''''i'''''&lt;math&gt;]=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;, the states &lt;math&gt;\left| \pm  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are also eigenstates of '''''i'''''. It turns out that &lt;math&gt;\left| +  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left| -  \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenstates of '''''i''''' with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in other words, the wave functions &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|+ \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{r}|- \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; are gerade (symmetric) and ungerade (unsymmetric), respectively). The corresponding expectation value of the energies are &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{\pm }}=\frac{1}{1\pm \left\langle 1|2 \right\rangle }({{H}_{11}}\pm {{H}_{12}})&lt;/math&gt;. [[File:H2plus figure 2.png|center|thumb|600x484px|The energy vs separation graphs of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. The two lowest curves denote the &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{-}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; states respectively. Higher ones are the excited states. The minimum of &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}
&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an energy &lt;math&gt;-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;]]

From the graph, we see that only &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}&lt;/math&gt; has a minimum corresponding to a separation of 1.3 &amp;Aring; and a total energy &lt;math&gt;{{E}_{+}}=-15.4 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;, which is less than the initial energy of the system, &lt;math&gt;-13.6 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, only the gerade state stabilizes the ion with a [[binding energy]] of &lt;math&gt;1.8 \text{ eV}&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the ground state of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{{X}^{2}}\Sigma _{g}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; and this state &lt;math&gt;\left( \left| +  \right\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt; is called a bonding molecular orbital.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{Cite book

Thus, symmetry plays an explicit role in the formation of &lt;math&gt;\text{H}_{2}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''"The Woman Who Had No Shadow"''' is a Scandinavian fairy tale, included by Sven Grundtvig in ''Gamle danske Minder i Folkemunde'' and Ella Ohlson in ''Sagor från Ångermanland''.&lt;ref name="redeem"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0756.html Forgiveness and Redemption: folktales of Aarne-Thompson types 755 and 756]"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne-Thompson]] type 755, Sin and grace.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
A woman, wishing to have no children, threw rocks into a well at a witch's direction.  Thereafter, she had no shadow.  Her husband, the parson, demanded to know why and threw her out, saying that their slate roof would blossom with flowers before she was forgiven.  One day, a beggar woman sought refuge there; she died in the night, the parson recognized her as his wife, and the housekeeper called him out to see how the roof had bloomed with flowers.

==Motifs==
The legend of ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' features the same growth as evidence of miraculous forgiveness.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss is loosely based on this tale.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">Most [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monasteries, temples and other religious structures in the [[Himalayas]] were decorated with '''Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings'''.  Despite much destruction in Tibet itself, many of these survive, the dry climate of the [[Tibetan plateau]] assisting their survival, as the wet Indian climate has reduced survival of paintings from there.  There are some regional differences, but the techniques described here cover the traditional wall paintings across this area. The wall paintings were executed on earthen plaster with the secco-technique.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, O.P. (ed.) (1989) "Wall Paintings - Asian Perspective. In: Wall Paintings of India- A Historical Perspective. Lucknow, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; A secco-technique is a painting technique in which the pigments with their binder are employed to paint onto a dry (Italian: secco) wall.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Detail wall painting, Ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail wall painting, Ladakh]]
[[File:Wall painting ladakh.jpg|thumb|Detail of a wall painting in a Buddhist temple in Ladakh/India]]
[[File:1000 armed Avalokiteshvara at Saspol cave DSCN7053 1.jpg|thumb|1000 armed [[Avalokiteshvara]] dated 13th - 15th century AD at Saspol cave in  [[Ladakh]], [[India]] ]]
The support for wall paintings in made of [[earthen plaster]], usually consisting of more than one layer of earthen plaster, in which the last layer was rendered as smoothly as possible.
The support was covered by a smoothened ground, generally in white. Materials employed for the ground may be kaolin, chalk or gypsum, or any other white material deriving from an inert mineral.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S.( 2005) "A Technical Study of Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India." In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; 
To organise the painting, preliminary sketches were carried out. Generally this involved  the geometric layout of the design with the help of snapped lines and/or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P., Jackson, J. A. (2006) ''Tibetan Thangka Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; Compasses were employed mainly for the construction of [[mandalas]]. Figures were roughly sketched, and then rendered with precise  contours. These outlines are usually in black.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study of the Early Buddhist Wall PAintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Repetitive designs were in some cases achieved with the use of [[stencils]].&lt;ref&gt;Lo Bue, E. (2006) "Tibetische Malerei." In: ''Tibet. Klöster öffnen ihre Schatzkammern''. (Exhibition catalogue. Museum für Asiatische Kunst. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.) Essen: Kulturstiftung Ruhr. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Traditionally, colour codes were employed to accelerate and simplify the colouring of the various ornaments and figures. For this purpose each section was given a number from 1-9 or an abbreviation of the name of the colour.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P, Jackson, J. A. (2006) "Tibetan [[Thangka]] Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Some paintings  were embellished with raised ornaments (pastiglia-technique).&lt;ref&gt;Dasser, K. L. (1996) "Some Observations on the Technology of the Wall Paintings in the Sumtsek. In: ''Alchi: Ladakh's Hidden Buddhist Sanctuary''. London: the Sumtsek, pp. 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt; Either a semi-liquid paste was applied to the painting surface, or a stamp had been previously produced from a mould and then applied onto the painting surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, S. (2005), "A Technical Study  of the Early Buddhist Wall Paintings at Nako, Himachal Pradesh, India". In: ''Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung''; 19/2, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting were employed. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system. Shading may be obtained with glazes, or with one of the dry shading systems, such as the dot-shading technique in which minuscle dots of colour cover the paintings surface.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. P., Jackson, J. A. (2006) "Tibetan Thangka Painting: methods and materials''. Hong Kong, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific details were then achieved with small paint brushes employing a variety of colours: black, white, ochre or red.

Specific ornaments of a representation were  enriched with gold. This  was either applied as a [[gold leaf]] or as powder in a binder.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzeo, R., et al (2004) "Characterization of Mural Painting Pigments from the Thubchen Lakhang Temple in Lo Manthang, Nepal". In: ''Journal of Raman Spectroscopy''; 35, p. 678-685.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts''', based in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]], was a performing arts center supported through the Shakur Family Foundation. The Shakur Center's mission was to provide opportunities for young people through the arts, and offers programs such as drama, dance, and creative writing classes. The organization also ran a Performing Arts Day Camp for youth ages twelve to eighteen.  

The center, located off of [[Memorial Drive (Atlanta)|Memorial Drive]] was named in honor of the late American [[Hip Hop]] artist [[Tupac Amaru Shakur]], and was founded by his mother [[Afeni Shakur]].&lt;ref name=RS_2016&gt;Lee, Christina. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/what-happened-to-the-tupac-amaru-shakur-center-for-the-arts-20160706 What Happened to the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts?]. Rolling Stone. 6 July 2016. Retrieved 22 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center was founded in 1997 by Tupac Shakur's mother [[Afeni Shakur]] in the interest of preserving her son's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/about.asp|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to bring quality arts training to young people including some students that face many social-economic issues such as poverty.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwIexeXLKecC&amp;pg=PT152&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=Tupac Remembered|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students have enriched their artistic abilities through this center and some have even received part-time jobs.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; 

In July 1999 the foundation began its first annual summer session of PA camps with twenty campers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bu6atp8MeBcC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=How Long Will They Mourn Me?|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp continued to grow throughout the years. On June 11, 2005 The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts Peace Garden and visitor centre was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/news_article.asp?id=67|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peace garden was designed as a tribute to Tupac Shakur as well as others who have died. In 2006 the music video for the single [[Pac's Life]] for the self-titled album was shot at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIlUNd7suew|title=2Pac - Pac's Life ft. T.I., Ashanti|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tupac's mother [[Afeni Shakur]] also went to Africa in 2006 and fostered a relationship between The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts and The Nelson Mendela foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=tupac+amaru+shakur+foundation&amp;lr=&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20amaru%20shakur%20foundation&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2006 the foundation showed signs of growth as many additional programs were created such as after school programs, dance classes and cultural exchange programs. Fees for these program resemble prices similar to those of joining a local sports league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasf.org/|title=Tasf.org|publisher=Tasf.org|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has also held Tupac birthday concert celebrations since 2009.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Programs==
The foundation offered acting, after school and dancing classes. In addition, they offer yearly leadership and arts programs. They had also set up cross cultural exchanges with Japan and South Africa.

'''''Two Crabs''''' is an 1889 [[oil painting]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is a [[still life]] of two crabs, one on its back and one upright, with a green background.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-two-crabs|title=Vincent van Gogh {{!}} Two Crabs {{!}} L995 {{!}} National Gallery, London|last=London|first=The National Gallery,|website=www.nationalgallery.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]] of {{convert|47|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Van Gogh is thought to have painted this work after his hospital release in January 1889. It was possibly inspired by a Japanese print of a crab by [[Hokusai]] that he had seen in the magazine ''[[Le Japon Artistique]]'', that his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] had sent him in September 1888.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The painting is held by the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]], on loan from a private collector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Hofkirche Innsbruck 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Tyrolean Folk Art Museum next to the Hofkirche in Innsbruck]]
The '''Tyrolean Folk Art Museum''' ({{lang-de|Tiroler Volkskunstmuseum}}) is considered one of the finest regional heritage museums in Europe.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Tyrol Folk Art Museum and Hofkirche |work=Tyrol |date= |url=http://www.tyrol.com/a-tyrol-folk-art-museum-and-hofkirche |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located next to the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck|Hofkirche]] and across from the [[Hofburg, Innsbruck|Hofburg]] in the Altstadt section of [[Innsbruck]], Austria, the museum contains the most important collection of cultural artifacts from the Tyrol region.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt;

The Tyrolean Folk Art Museum is housed in four wings of a former Franciscan monastery (the displaced community later established [[Lienz Friary]]) around an arcaded Renaissance courtyard. The permanent exhibition includes an extensive collection of old handicrafts, traditional costumes, household items, glass and pottery, peasant furniture, textiles, tools, metalwork, and religious and secular folk art from the various regions of Tyrol.

The museum houses several carefully restored wood-paneled rooms from the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods, that came from actual farms and noble houses.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt; The museum also contains an extensive collection of mangers made of wood, wax, earthenware, and paper, dating back to the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="tyrol.com"/&gt;

'''''Washington Crossing the Delaware''''' is an 1851 oil-on-canvas painting by the [[German Americans|German-American]] artist [[Emanuel Leutze]].

It commemorates General [[George Washington]] during his famous [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing of the Delaware River]] with the [[Continental Army]] on the night of December 25–26, 1776, during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. That action was the first move in a surprise attack against the [[Germany|German]] [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian allied mercenary forces]] at [[Trenton, New Jersey]], in the [[Battle of Trenton]] on the morning of December 26.

The original was part of the collection at the [[Kunsthalle Bremen|Kunsthalle]] in [[Bremen]], Germany, and was destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942, during [[World War II]]. Leutze painted two more versions, one of which is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].  The other was in the [[West Wing]] reception area of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; but in March 2015, was put on display at The [[Minnesota Marine Art Museum]] in [[Winona, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news8000.com/news/washington-crossing-the-delaware-art-piece-on-display-at-mmam/31956620 |title='Washington Crossing The Delaware' art piece on display at MMAM |date=March 22, 2015 |website=News8000.com |publisher=Morgan Murphy Media |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Übergang Washingtons über den Delaware.jpg|thumb|''Washington Crossing the Delaware'' (1849–1850)&lt;br /&gt;Original painting by Leutze]]

Emanuel Leutze grew up in America, then returned to Germany as an adult, where he conceived  the idea for this painting during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Hoping to encourage Europe's liberal reformers through the example of the American Revolution, and using American tourists and art students as models and assistants, among them [[Worthington Whittredge]] and [[Andreas Achenbach]], Leutze finished the first painting in 1850. Just after it was completed, the first version was damaged by fire in his studio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/robert-sullivan-my-american-revolution-2012-9/|title=Permanent Revolution|publisher=''New York'' magazine|date=Sep 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently restored, and acquired by the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]]. On September 5, 1942, during World War II, it was destroyed in a [[bombing raid]] by the [[Allied forces (World War II)|Allied forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spassky|first1=Natalie|title=American Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. A Catalogue of Works by Artists Born between 1816 and 1845|volume=2|chapter=Washington Crossing the Delaware|date=1985|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|pages=17–18 |url=https://archive.org/stream/AmericanPaintingsinTheMetropolitanMuseumofArtVol2ACatalogueofWorksbyArtistsBornbe#page/n73/mode/2up |isbn=978-0-87099-439-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second painting, a full-sized replica of the first, was begun in 1850 and placed on exhibition in New York in October 1851. More than 50,000 people viewed it. The painting was originally bought by Marshall O. Roberts for $10,000 (at the time, an enormous sum). After changing ownership several times, it was finally donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] by [[John Stewart Kennedy]] in 1897. ''Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth'', Leutze's companion piece to ''Washington Crossing the Delaware'' is displayed in the Heyns (East) Reading Room of [[University of California, Berkeley Library System|Doe Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

The painting was lent at least twice in its history. In the early 1950s, it was part of an exhibition in [[Dallas]], Texas. Then, beginning in 1952, it was exhibited for several years at the United Methodist Church in [[Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania]], not far from the scene of the painting. Today, it is on exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In January 2002, the painting was defaced when a former Metropolitan Museum of Art guard glued a picture of the [[September 11 attacks]] to it. No major damage was caused to the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/03/008.html Painting gets 9/11 Defacing] {{webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20100204215806/http://www.museum-security.org/03/008.html |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple frame that had been with the painting for over 90 years turned out not to be the original frame that Leutze designed.  A photograph taken by [[Mathew Brady]] in 1864 was found in the New York Historical Society in 2007 showing the painting in a spectacular eagle crested frame.  The 12 ft x 21 ft carved replica frame was created using this photo by [http://www.eliwilner.com/projects/washington-delaware.php Eli Wilner &amp; Company] in New York City. The carved eagle-topped crest alone is 14 ft wide.

== Composition ==

The painting is notable for its artistic [[composition (visual arts)|composition]]. [[George Washington|General Washington]] is emphasized by an unnaturally bright sky, while his face catches the upcoming sun. The colors consist of mostly dark tones, as is to be expected at dawn, but there are red highlights repeated throughout the painting. [[Foreshortening]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and the distant boats all lend depth to the painting and emphasize the boat carrying Washington.

The people in the boat represent a cross-section of the American colonies, including a man in a Scottish bonnet and a man of African descent facing backward next to each other in the front, western riflemen at the bow and stern, two farmers in broad-brimmed hats near the back (one with bandaged head), and an androgynous rower in a red shirt, possibly meant to be a woman in man's clothing. There is also a man at the back of the boat wearing what appears to be Native American garb to represent the idea that all people in the new United States of America were represented as present in the boat along with Washington on his way to victory and success.

According to the 1853 exhibition catalogue, the man standing next to Washington and holding the flag is Lieutenant [[James Monroe]], future President of the United States, and the man leaning over the side is General [[Nathanael Greene]].{{sfnp|Spassky|1985|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/AmericanPaintingsinTheMetropolitanMuseumofArtVol2ACatalogueofWorksbyArtistsBornbe#page/n75/mode/2up pp. 20–21]}} Also, General [[Edward Hand]] is shown seated and holding his hat within the vessel.

== Historical inaccuracies ==

Washington's stance, obviously intended to depict him in a [[hero]]ic fashion, would have been very hard to maintain in the stormy conditions of the crossing. Considering that he is standing in a rowboat, such a stance would have risked capsizing the boat.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/ny_museum_to_unveil_more_accur.html|title=N.Y. museum to unveil more accurate version of George Washington's Delaware River crossing|last=Associated Press|date=December 24, 2011|work=NJ.com|publisher=The Star Ledger|accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[David Hackett Fischer]] has argued that everyone would have been standing up to avoid the icy water in the bottom of the boat, while the actual [[Durham boat]]s used were much larger having a flat bottom, higher sides, a broad beam (width) of some eight feet and a draft of 24-30 inches deep.&lt;ref&gt;[[#fischer|Fischer, 2004]], pp. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
[[File:1999 NJ Proof.png|thumb|The painting depicted on the New Jersey [[State quarters|state quarter]]]]
[[William H. Powell]] produced a painting that owes an artistic debt to Luetze's work, depicting [[Oliver Perry]] transferring command from one ship to another during the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] during the [[War of 1812]]. The original painting now hangs in the [[Ohio Statehouse]], and Powell later created a larger, more light toned rendering of the same subject which hangs in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. In both of Powell's works, Perry is shown standing in a small boat rowed by several men in uniform. The Washington painting shows the direction of travel from right to left, and the Perry image shows a reverse direction of motion, but the two compositions are still similar. Both paintings feature one occupant of the boat with a bandaged head.

In 1953, the American [[pop art]]ist [[Larry Rivers]] painted ''Washington Crossing the Delaware'', which is in the collection of [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/m_r/ohara/rivers.htm On seeing ''Washington Crossing the Delaware,'' by Larry Rivers retrieved June 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has also inspired copies by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] (an abstract expressionist variant painted c. 1951) and [[Robert Colescott]] (a parody titled ''George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware'' painted in 1975). * [[Grant Wood]] makes direct use of Leutze's painting in his own ''Daughters of Revolution''.  The painting is a direct jab at the D.A.R., scrutinizing what Wood interpreted as their unfounded elitism.

"[[Washington Crossing the Delaware (sonnet)|Washington Crossing the Delaware]]" is a 1936 [[sonnet]] by [[David Shulman]]. It refers to the scene in the painting, and is a 14-line rhyming sonnet of which every line is an [[anagram]] of the title.

The movie poster of the 2011 film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' features the characters of Winnie and his friends in a honeypot, floating in honey. Tigger is the rower, with Winnie stylized as Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://disneyetc.blogspot.com/2011/02/brilliant-new-pooh-poster.html Disney, ETC.

The '''West Main District''' is one of the five districts of [[Downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]].  The district, or a portion of it, is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''West Main Street Historic District''', due to its containment of some of the oldest structures in the city. The buildings of this district boast the largest collection of cast iron façades of anywhere outside [[New York City|New York]]'s [[SoHo]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103233/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/DowntownDevelopment/News/2006/DowntownActivity.htm Louisville's Downtown Alive with Development]&lt;/ref&gt; The district also features "Museum Row", a collection of several notable museums located within just a few blocks of each other.

The district, named for its main corridor of West Main Street, includes the 800-600 blocks of Main and the southern side of the 500 block.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Yabba at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]

'''Stephen Harold Gascoigne''', better known as '''Yabba''', (19 March 1878 - 8 January 1942) was an [[Australian]] sports fan, remembered as a [[heckler]] at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]] games in the early part of the 20th century. ''Yabba'' was known for his knowledgeable witticisms shouted loudly from "The Hill", a grassy general admissions area of the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].

In Yabba's era, cricket matches were watched like tennis matches, and spectators at the SCG were much quieter than today. This is the reason Yabba's comments were so clearly heard by players and other spectators.

"The Hill" area was replaced with seating in the early 1990s. The new area was then formally named ''Yabba's Hill'' in honour of his colourful comments, several of which have passed into cricketing folklore.  In 2007 the [[Doug Walters]] Stand and ''Yabba's Hill'' were demolished to make way for the new [[Victor Trumper]] Stand. On 7 December 2008 a bronze statue of Yabba, sculpted by [[Cathy Weiszmann]], was unveiled at the Sydney Cricket Ground in ''The Hill'' area of the new stand. It depicts Yabba in a characteristic pose, one hand acting as a megaphone, in the act of delivering one of his famous interjections. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Yabba was portrayed by [[Paul Chubb]] in the 1984 mini-series [[Bodyline (miniseries)|''Bodyline'']].

==Insults==
[[File:Yabba Statue SCG 2.JPG|thumb|Yabba's view across the pitch of the Sydney Cricket Ground]]
Some of Yabba's best remembered insults include:

* "I wish you were a statue and I were a pigeon."
* Telling a fly-swatting English cricket captain, [[Douglas Jardine]], to "Leave our flies alone, Jardine. They're the only friends you've got here."
* "Send 'im down a piano, see if 'e can play that!"
* "Oh for a strong arm and a walking stick!" (at bad bowling; leg spinner [[Arthur Mailey]], a regular victim of this one, quotes it several times in his book 10 for 66 and All That)
* "Those are the only balls you've touched all day!" (To an English batsman adjusting his [[box (cricket)|box]] in between overs).
* "Put a penny in him, George, he's stopped registering" (To umpire George Borwick who read [[gas meter]]s and emptied the cash boxes for a living, when [[Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi]] was scoring slowly) 
* "Your length's lousy but you bowl a good width!" (To an opposition bowler)

He was probably of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin in [[Amaseia]] and carried off when he was very young.&lt;ref name="Houtsma 1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913-1936, Volume 1 |last= Houtsma |first= M. Th |year=1987 |publisher= BRILL|isbn=9789004082656 |quote= YAKUT al-MUSTA'SIMI, Djamal al-DIn Auu 'l-Madjd ... some say he was a Greek from Amasia; he was probably carried off on a razzia while still very young. He was a eunuch. |page=1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was a slave in the court of Al-Musta'sim and went on to become a calligrapher in the Royal Court. He spent most of his life in Baghdad and converted to Islam. &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.T., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with the female scholar and calligrapher, Shuhda Bint Al-‘Ibari, who was herself a student in the direct line of [[Ibn al-Bawwab]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mongol invasion of Baghdad (1258), he took refuge in the minaret of a mosque so he could finish his calligraphy practice, while the city was being ransacked. His career, however, flourished under Mongol patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442; "Yaqut al-Musta'simi" [Biography], ''Islamic Arts'',  [http://islamic-arts.org/2011/yaqut-al-musta%E2%80%98simi/ Islamic Arts Online (in English):]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He refined and codified six basic calligraphic styles of the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sözen|first=Metin|title=The evolution of Turkish art and architecture|year=1987|publisher=Haşet Kitabevi|author2=İlhan Akşit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naskh (script)|Naskh script]] was said to have been revealed and taught to the scribe in a vision. He improved on [[Ibn Muqla]]'s style by replacing the straight cut reed pen with an oblique cut, which resulted in a more elegant script.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442;  Sajoo, A.B., ''A Companion to Muslim Cultures'', I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He developed ''Yakuti'', a handwriting named after him, described as a [[thuluth]] of "a particularly elegant and beautiful type."&lt;ref name="efendi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Efendi|first=Cafer|title=Risāle-i miʻmāriyye: an early-seventeenth-century Ottoman treatise on architecture: facsimile with translation and notes|year=1987|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-07846-8|pages=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJk3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36|author2=Howard Crane |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught many students, both Arab and non-Arab. His most celebrated students are Ahmad b. al-Suhrawardi and Yahya al-Sufi.&lt;ref&gt;Sajoo, A.B., ''A Companion to Muslim Cultures'', I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 148; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; 

He became a much-celebrated calligrapher across the Arab-speaking world. His school became the model followed by Persian and Ottoman calligraphers for centuries. In the second half of the 13th-century, he gained the honorific, ''quiblat al-kuttab'' [cynosure of the calligraphers]. &lt;ref&gt;Türk ve İslâm Eserleri Müzesi, ''The Art of the Qurʼan: Treasures from the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts'', Smithsonian Institution, 2016, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

His output was prolific. Although, he is said to have copied the [[Qur'an]] more than a thousand times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knappert|first=Jan|title=Swahili culture, Book 2|year=2005|publisher=E. Mellen Press|isbn=978-0-7734-6109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; problems with attributing his work, may have contributed to exaggerated estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, N., ''Sacred Script: Muhaqqaq in Islamic Calligraphy'', I.B. Tauris, 2011,  p. 88n&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources suggest that he produced 364 copies of the Q'ran.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Arts'',  [http://islamic-arts.org/2011/yaqut-al-musta%E2%80%98simi/ Islamic Arts Online (in English):]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last of the great medieval calligraphers.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;
