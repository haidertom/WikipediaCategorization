The '''Academy of Management''' ('''AOM'''; '''the Academy''') is a [[professional association]] for [[scholars]] of [[management]] and [[organizations]] that was established in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aom.org/About-AOM/History.aspx |title=AOM History |accessdate=2013-01-30 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes several [[academic journal]]s, organizes conferences, and provides others forums for management [[professor]]s and managers to communicate research and ideas.

Since 1994, the Academy has been headquartered on the [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] campus of [[Pace University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pace University|url=http://aom.org/pace.aspx|publisher=Academy of Management|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==
Upon registration, members of the Academy are granted memberships in two of its 25 divisions and interest groups; they may then pay an additional fee to join more. Each division focuses on a certain aspect of management, and each division has its own governing officers. As of August 2015, these divisions and interest groups include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://login.aomonline.org/aom.asp?id=18 |title=AoM Divisions and Interest Groups |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Examples of cut-time and 2-2 notation.jpg|thumb|Examples of time signatures for ''alla breve''.]]
[[File:Examples of common-time and 4-4 notation.jpg|thumb|Examples of time signatures for common time.]]
'''''Alla breve''''' {{IPA-it|alla ˈbrɛːve|}} is a [[Meter (music)|musical meter]] notated by the [[time signature]] symbol {{music|cut-time}} (a C with a vertical line through it), which is the equivalent of {{music|time|2|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Randel (2003), pp.33, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "on the breve",  originally meaning that the beat was counted on the [[double whole note|breve]].&lt;ref&gt;LilyPond — Music Glossary v2.18.2 (http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/alla-breve)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alla breve'' is a "[[Meter (music)#Simple meter|simple]]-[[duple meter]] with a half-note [[pulse (music)|pulse]]".&lt;ref name="Duckworth"&gt;Duckworth, William (2009). ''A Creative Approach to Music Fundamentals'', p.38. {{ISBN|0-495-57220-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The note denomination which represents one beat in is the [[minim (music)|minim]] or half-note.  There are two of these per bar, so that the time signature {{music|time|2|2}} may be interpreted as "two minim beats per bar."

''Alla breve'' is also known as '''cut time''' or '''cut common time'''.  (Common time, notated with the time signature symbol {{music|common-time}}, is the equivalent of {{music|time|4|4}}.&lt;ref name=Randel33/&gt;  It uses a [[quarter note]] (or crotchet) beat and there are four per bar.)

==Modern usage==
In contemporary usage ''alla breve'' suggests a fairly quick [[tempo]]. Thus, it is used frequently for military [[march (music)|marches]]. From about 1600 to 1900 its usage with regard to tempo varied, so it cannot always be taken to mean a quick tempo.&lt;ref name=Randel33&gt;Randel (2003), p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for the usage of "alla breve" is to allow the musician to read notes of short duration more cleanly with fewer beats.

==Historical usage==
Prior to 1600 the term ''alla breve'' derives from the system of [[mensural notation|mensural or proportional notation]] (also called ''proportio dupla'') in which note values (and their graphical shapes) were related by the ratio 2:1. In this context it means that the ''tactus'' or metrical pulse (now commonly referred to as the "[[Beat (music)|beat]]") is switched from its normal place on the [[whole note]] (''semibreve'') to the [[double whole note]] (''breve'').&lt;ref name=Randel33/&gt;

Early music notation was developed by religious orders, which has resulted in some religious associations in notation. The most obvious is that music in triple time was called ''tempus perfectum'', deriving its name from the [[Holy Trinity]] and represented by the "perfect" circle, which has no beginning or end.

Music in duple time was similarly called ''tempus imperfectum''. Its symbol was the broken circle, " {{music|common-time}}", which is still used — although it has evolved to mean {{music|time|4|4}}, or "common time", today. When cut through by a vertical line "{{music|cut-time}}" , it means {{music|time|2|2}} — "cut common", or alla breve.&lt;ref&gt;Novello, John (1986). ''The Contemporary Keyboardist'', p.37. {{ISBN|0-634-01091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the vertical line or stroke in a musical graphical symbol, as practiced in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and now referred to by the modern term of "cut time", did not always have the same meaning as ''alla breve''. It sometimes had other functions, including non-mensural ones.&lt;ref&gt;"Cut time" in Sadie (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The following is an example with the same rhythm notated in {{music|time|2|2}} and in {{music|time|4|4}}:

|[[File:Cut time as 4-4.png|thumb|400px|center|Rhythm in {{music|time|2|2}} followed by the same rhythm notated in {{music|time|4|4}}. Note there are more eighth and sixteenth notes in the {{music|time|4|4}} version versus eighth and quarter notes in the {{music|time|2|2}} version, one of the reasons {{music|time|2|2}} is typically easier to read at faster tempos.&lt;ref&gt;Schonbrun , Marc (2005). ''The Everything Reading Music Book'', p.56. {{ISBN|1-59337-324-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Andrews curve for Iris data set.png|thumb|360px|Andrews curve for Iris data set]]

In [[data visualization]], an '''Andrews plot''' or '''Andrews curve''' is a way to visualize structure in high-dimensional data. It is basically a rolled-down, non-integer version of the Kent–Kiviat [[radar chart|radar m chart]], or a smoothened version of a [[parallel coordinates|parallel coordinate plot]].

A value &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Real coordinate space|high-dimensional datapoint]] if it is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R ^d &lt;/math&gt;. We can represent high-dimensional data with a number for each of their dimensions,  &lt;math&gt;x = \left \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  To visualize them, the Andrews plot  defines a finite [[Fourier series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;f_x(t) = \frac{x_1}{\sqrt 2} + x_2 \sin(t) + x_3 \cos(t) + x_4 \sin(2t) + x_5 \cos(2t) + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This function is then plotted for &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; t &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus each data point may be viewed as a line between &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This formula can be thought of as the projection of the data point onto the vector:

: &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}, \sin(t), \cos(t), \sin(2t), \cos(2t), \ldots \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

If there is structure in the data, it may be visible in the Andrews' curves of the data.

These curves have been utilized in fields as different as [[biology]], [[neurology]], [[sociology]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing. Some of their uses include the [[quality control]] of products, the detection of period and [[outlier]]s in [[time series]], the visualization of learning in [[artificial neural network]]s, and correspondence analysis.

Theoretically, it is possible to project them onto an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]. The projection onto the circle results in the aforementioned [[Radar chart]]. This could prove to be a powerful computer-aided multivariable visualization method if, upon projection onto the common tridimensional sphere, the layers are given some degree of transparency on their [[alpha channel]] so as to allow to see through.

'''''Annals of Philosophy''''' was a [[learned journal]] founded in 1813 by the Scottish chemist [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. It shortly became a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.{{sfn|Morrell|2004}} Contributors included &lt;!--[[Friedrich Christian Accum]], --&gt;[[John George Children]],{{sfn|Bettany|1887}} [[Edward Daniel Clarke]],{{sfn|Wroth|1887}}  &lt;!--[[William Daniel Conybeare]], --&gt;[[Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet|Philip Crampton]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p 170}}{{sfn|Bettany|1888}} [[Alexander Crichton]],{{sfn|Boase|1888}}  [[James Cumming (chemist)|James Cumming]],{{sfn|Bettany|1888a}} &lt;!--[[Michael Faraday]], --&gt;[[John Herapath]],{{sfn|Goodwin|1891}}  [[William George Horner]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp 281 – 283}} &lt;!--[[Agnes Ibbetson]], --&gt;[[Thomas Dick Lauder]],{{sfn|Henderson|1892}}  [[John Miers (botanist)|John Miers]],{{sfn|Boulger|1894}} [[Matthew Paul Moyle]],{{sfn|Boase|1894}} [[Robert Porrett]],{{sfn|Hartog|1896}}  [[James Thomson (minister)|James Thomson]],{{sfn|Carlyle|1898}} and [[Charles Wheatstone]].{{sfn|Thompson|1899}}

Thomson edited it until 1821, when he was succeeded in 1821 by [[Richard Phillips (chemist)|Richard Phillips]]. The journal was bought by [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Harden|1898}}

The ''Annals of Philosophy'' were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the [[Napoleonic Wars]] made communications with the continent difficult at first,{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp iii – iv}} etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a [[meteorological]] journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p iii}}  Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, pp v–viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol II, pp iv – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol IV, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol V, pp vi – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VII, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VIII, pp iii – vii}}

'''Applied ecology''' is a subfield within [[ecology]], which considers the [[applied science|application]] of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions.  It is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management.  It is also called ecological or environmental technology.  Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.

Aspects of applied ecology include:

* [[Biodiversity]] [[conservation biology|conservation]]
* [[Biotechnology]]
* [[Conservation biology]]
* [[Ecosystem restoration]]
* [[habitat (ecology)|Habitat]] management
* [[Invasive species]] management
* [[Protected areas]] management
* [[Rangeland]] management
* [[Restoration ecology]]

Major journals in the field include:

* ''[[Journal of Applied Ecology]]''
* ''[[Ecological Applications]]''

Ambedkar was a prolific student earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]] and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics, and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/hindi/india/zee-jankari-important-facts-of-dr-bhimrao-ambedkar/288606|title=Zee जानकारी : किसने रची थी डॉ. अंबेडकर के बारे में भ्रम फैलाने की साजिश|date=2016-04-15|work=Zee News Hindi|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, he converted to [[Buddhism]] initiating mass conversions of Dalits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

In 1990, the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".&lt;ref name = "Waiting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&amp;nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&amp;nbsp;– and two daughters&amp;nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&amp;nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was ''Sakpal'' but his father registered his name as ''Ambadawekar'' in school, meaning he comes from his native village '[[Ambadawe]]' in Ratnagiri district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta News Paper dated -14/04/2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000741/http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta Dated-14/04/2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000741/http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/   Daily Loksatta Dated 18/04/2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020002119/http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-ambedkars-teacher-family-saving-memories-of-ambedkar-5489831-NOR.html|title=आंबेडकर गुरुजींचं कुटुंब जपतंय सामाजिक वसा, कुटुंबानं सांभाळल्या 'त्या' आठवणी|author=|date=26 December 2016|website=bhaskar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ambavadekar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871 |title=Bhim, Eklavya |publisher=outlookindia.com |accessdate=17 July 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811223316/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871| archivedate= 11 August 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Devrukhe]] [[Brahmin]] teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from "Ambadawekar" to his own surname "Ambedkar" in school records.&lt;ref name="m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com"/&gt;

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].&lt;ref name="Columbia2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. In his book, ''The Buddha and his Dhamma'', that when he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.&lt;ref name="Columbia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/00_pref_unpub.html unpublished preface of "The Buddha and his Dhamma"], cite 5th para&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.&lt;ref name="Columbia3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India&amp;nbsp;– A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.&lt;ref name="Columbia3" /&gt; He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"/&gt; In 1922, he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn and In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20D'Litt|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, ''[[Waiting for a Visa]]''.&lt;ref name="Rewriting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Dr. B.R.|title=Waiting for a Visa|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624202609/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |year=1971 |origyear=1954 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8171542376 |oclc=123913369 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he became Professor of Political Economy in the [[Sydenham College|Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]] in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Ian |editor-last= Harris |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rwiLKm3LGUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ambedkar+discriminated+at+Sydenham+College+of+Comme#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20discriminated%20at%20Sydenham%20College%20of%20Comme |title=Buddhism and politics in twentieth-century Asia |publisher=Continuum International Group |isbn= 9780826451781 |date= 2001-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate [[electoral district|electorates]] and [[reservation in India|reservations]] for untouchables and other religious communities.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first=Shabnum|title=Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history, 1890-1950|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0253220448|pages=205–210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22ambedkar%22+%22+Southborough+Committee%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ambedkar%22%20%22%20Southborough%20Committee%22|accessdate=17 July 2013|chapter=From Untouchable to Hindu Gandhi, Ambedkar and Depressed class question 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly ''Mooknayak'' (''Leader of the Silent'') in Mumbai with the help of [[Shahu of Kolhapur]] i.e. Shahu IV (1874–1922).&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1995|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171542376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5u9hDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=7 Reformers who Change the World|last=Mookherji|first=Kalyani|date=101-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |accessdate=12 January 2012 |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archivedate=8 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the defence of Dalit rights, he started five periodicals - ''Mooknayak'' (the leader of the dumb, 1920), ''Bahishkrit Bharat'' (Ostracized India, 1924), ''Samta'' (Equality, 1928), ''Janata'' (The People, 1930), and ''Prabuddha Bharat'' (Enlightened India, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/07/ambedkars-journalism-and-its-significance-today/|title=Ambedkar’s journalism and its significance today|date=2017-07-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|title=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|website=velivada.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand17/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-42-45/9964-2012-06-14-09-33-10?showall=&amp;start=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prahaar.in/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC/|title=पत्रकार डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर {{!}}|website=prahaar.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahamtb.com/Encyc/2017/12/6/Article-on-journalist-babasaheb-Ambedkar-by-ravindra-gole.html|title=पत्रकार आंबेडकर|website=mahamtb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Kamble, Rajeev|date=2002-12-31|title=Dr Ambedkar as a journalist a study|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/104917|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beedlive.com/newsdetail?cat=Madhyam&amp;id=2046&amp;news=%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE.html|title=डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची आदर्श पत्रकारिता|website=beedlive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahanews.gov.in/Home/FrontMantralayDetails.aspx?str=utYf/MWKOh8=|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर एक बहुआयामी व्यक्तीमत्त्व - डॉ. गंगाधर पानतावणे|website=mahanews.gov.in|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led a ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |accessdate=26 December 2010 |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation.

In 1932, British announced the formation of a separate electorate for "Depressed Classes" in the [[Communal Award]]. [[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poona Pact – 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]].

The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]] earlier proposed by British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]].

In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the [[Government Law College, Bombay]], a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of [[Ramjas College]], University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecampusconnect.com/7-interesting-historical-facts-about-ramjas-college-university-of-delhi/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.&lt;ref name="Columbia5"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| title = In the 1930s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906055230/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| archivedate= 6 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Columbia5"/&gt; He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |p=73–76 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402094202/http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pp=124,&amp;nbsp;134,&amp;nbsp;142–144,&amp;nbsp;149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.&lt;ref name="Firstpost 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao Ramji|title=Pakistan or the Partition of India|year=1946|publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|pages=215–219|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912185829/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/&gt;

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/&gt;}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.&lt;ref name=Jamanadas&gt;{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Dr. Sharada Kabir, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. She was 39 year old and he was 57.

==Conversion to Buddhism==

Ambedkar considered converting to [[Sikhism]], which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes.

{{canon law}}
In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], a '''canon''' is a certain rule or norm of conduct or belief prescribed by the [[Catholic Church]]. The word "canon" comes from the Greek ''kanon'', which in its original usage denoted a straight rod that was later the instrument used by architects and artificers as a measuring stick for making straight lines.&lt;ref name=Berman199&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanon'' eventually came to mean a rule or norm, so that when the first ecumenical council—[[Nicaea I]]—was held in 325, ''kanon'' started to obtain the restricted juridical denotation of a law [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by a [[synod]] or [[ecumenical council]], as well as that of an individual bishop.&lt;ref name=Berman199/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary|canon law}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / {{lang-grc|κανών}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qanun / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (''cf.'' the Romance-language ancestors of the English word "cane"). A ''kanon'' was the instrument used by architects and artificers for making straight lines.

==Pre-Nicene usage==
{{main article|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
Some writers think that the Church preferred the word ''canon'' to ''[[law]]'', as the latter had a harsh meaning for the faithful in the times of persecution.

The early Fathers use canon as equivalent to the rule of faith, or for some formula expressing a binding obligation on Christians.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Irenæus, Adv. Hær., I, ix; Tertullian, De Præscr., 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bickell declares that for the first three hundred years, canon is scarcely ever found for a separate and special decree of the Church; rather does it designate the rule of faith in general. He appeals to the fact that the plural form of the word is seldom used in the earliest Christian writers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, I, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicene and Medieval usage==
With the fourth century began the use of canon for a disciplinary decree, owing to its employment in this sense by the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 A.D.).

The Cassinese editors of Ferraris (s. v. Canones) say that in the first ages of the Church many disciplinary regulations were not required, and hence it was scarcely necessary to discriminate decrees into dogmatic and disciplinary, as the faithful classed both under the obligation to observe the general rule of faith.

===''Canon'' vs. ''decretum''===
{{see also|Decree (canon law)|Decretal|Decretum Gratiani}}
From the fourth century onward, ''canon'' signified almost universally a disciplinary decree of a council or of the [[Roman Pontiff]]s.

The word ''decretum'' during the same period, though signifying in general an authoritative statute or decision, began to be limited more and more to dogmatic matters, while canon when used in opposition to it was restricted to laws of discipline. That this usage, however, was not invariable is evident from [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s use of "[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]" to signify his collection of canons and decrees.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] himself entitled his work ''Concordantia discordantium canonum'' or "Concordance of Discordant Canons". Early [[Decretists]] gave to Gratian's [[codification (law)|codification]] the title of ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tridentine usage==
From the [[First Council of Nicea]] up to the beginning of the [[Council of Trent]], the regulations concerning discipline issued by assemblies of bishops received the name of canons.

With the [[Council of Trent]] in the sixteenth century began the departure from this ancient usage. This council used the word ''canon'' for short, dogmatic definitions with an anathema attached to them. On the other hand, it gave the name of ''decrees'' to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by Trent was followed by the [[First Council of the Vatican]].

The usage of Trent seems to bring ''canon'' nearer to the signification it bore before the [[First Council of Nicea]], when it referred rather to faith than to discipline. The general idea of a decision by Church authority seems to be also the root-meaning of the expressions "[[Canon of Scripture]]", "[[Canon of the Mass]]", "[[Canonization#Catholic Church|Canon of Saints]]", although for the last term Ducange (s. v. Canonizare) suggests a somewhat different origin.

==Codifications==
As ecclesiastical regulations began to multiply, it became necessary to gather them into codices, which generally received the title of "[[Collections of ancient canons|Collection of Canons]]". In these, civil laws are often added to the Church regulations. For such collections the Greeks used the term ''[[Nomocanon]]es''. The Latins have no special name for them, though Capitularies (q. v.), e. g. of Charlemagne, is sometimes referred to as a somewhat parallel usage in the West.

==Authority==
As to the authority of ecclesiastical canons, it is evident a distinction must be made when speaking of canons of faith and canons of discipline, for the former are irreversible, the latter are not. Similarly, it is plain that canons containing a precept already binding by reason of [[Divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]], cannot be on the same footing as those that are of mere ecclesiastical origin.

In general, the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'' declares&lt;ref group=note&gt;Cf. cap. 1. de Const.&lt;/ref&gt; that canonical statutes are binding on all; likewise&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Corpus Juris Canonici'', cap. Quum scimus&lt;/ref&gt; that bishops are the guardians of the canons and must see to their observance. When there is question of canons in the ordinary ecclesiastical sense (namely, that which obtained before the [[Council of Trent]]), as they refer principally to matters of discipline, it must be borne in mind that they are neither immutable nor irreformable.

The subject-matter of such canons depends not only on circumstances of persons, places, and times, but also on considerations of expediency or temporary necessity. A change in any of the causes which brought about the framing of the canons, will make a change in their binding-force, for disciplinary regulations are almost necessarily mutable.

In like manner when there is question of the binding force of a canon, it is important to determine whether it was issued by a [[ecumenical council|general council]] or by the decree of a [[pope]], as imposing an obligation on all the faithful, or whether it was framed solely for restricted regions or persons. In the latter case its binding-force is as restricted as its scope.

==Abrogation, Obrogation, and Custom==
{{main article|Obrogation|Custom (canon law)}}
It must be borne in mind that the object which the Church has always had in view in [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgating]] her canons has been the guidance and preservation of the clergy and laity in the duties of a Christian life and in the best methods of ecclesiastical administration.

Although, therefore, such canons contain elements of positive human law, yet ultimately they are founded on the [[divine law|Divine]] or [[natural law]]. As such, they cannot be entirely abrogated by contrary custom (Ferraris, loc. cit.), though their rigour may be mitigated by certain circumstances, on the ceasing of which, the pristine rigour of the canon would be again binding.

When they are entirely of human law, they may, of course, be completely abrogated, not only by legislation on the part of the proper authorities, but also by legitimate custom.

William H. W. Fanning, in his 1913 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on ''Ecclesiastical canons'', suggests that
{{quote|The neglect of the prescriptions of the sacred canons has always been the source of corruption in morals, and perhaps the chief reason for the loss of faith by nations as well as by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;WikiSource, "Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)", [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Ecclesiastical_Canons ''Ecclesiastical Canons''], accessed 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Fanning, the study of the sacred canons is especially enjoined on the clergy. Fanning speculates that perhaps most of the regulations refer directly to ecclesiastics, and suggests that clergy will find in them the surest guidance for their own conduct and for the fruitful exercise of their ministry in directing the faithful.

[[File:CODICOLOGY.jpg|thumb|upright|Codicological signs]]
'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

[[File:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.jpg|thumbnail|Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]
'''Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory''' ('''CSHL''') is a private, non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer, [[neuroscience]], plant biology, [[genomics]], and [[quantitative biology]].&lt;ref&gt;As described here: [http://www.cshl.edu] and here: [http://www.cshl.edu/Annual-Reports/2012-annual-report]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of 68 institutions supported by the [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|Cancer Centers Program]] of the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) and has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is one of a handful of institutions that played a central role in the development of molecular genetics and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace Freedland Judson, ''The Eighth Day of Creation: The Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1979), esp. pp. 65-69; also: 44-46; 53; 57-58; 62; 70; 82; 185; 232; 239; 247; 273; 321; 368; 392; 454; 458-59; 572-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been home to eight scientists who have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. CSHL is ranked among the leading [[basic research]] institutions in molecular biology and genetics with Thomson Reuters ranking it #1 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Thompson Reuters Essential Science Indicators, [http://archive.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/08/may25-08_4/]. The ranking is based on average citation frequency of faculty research papers published between January 2002 and December 2012. (96.94 citations of each CSHL paper, average.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is led by [[Bruce Stillman]], a biochemist and cancer researcher.

Since its inception in 1890, the institution's campus on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] of [[Long Island]] has also been a center of biology education. Current CSHL educational programs serve professional scientists, doctoral students in biology, teachers of biology in the K-12 system, and students from the elementary grades through high school. In the past 10 years CSHL conferences &amp; courses have drawn over 81,000 scientists and students to the main campus.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|title=CSHL Facts &amp; Figures - About Us|author=WebServices|publisher=|access-date=2014-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322050319/https://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|archive-date=2014-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, many scientists consider CSHL a "crossroads of biological science."&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., current director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/genome-research/competition-science/competition-human-genome-project-public-vs-private/]; Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/cshl/special-aspects/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-center-science/]; Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, M.D., referring to the institutional setting of CSHL's graduate school: [http://www.cshl.edu/Archive/watson-school-of-biological-sciences-culminates-commencement-weekend-conferring-degrees-on-its-fifth-graduating-class]; See also:  R. Sanders Williams, "Sputnik, Slime Molds, and Botticelli in the Making of a Physician-Scientist," in David A. Schwartz, ed., Medicine, Science and Dreams: The Making of Physician-Scientists (Springer, 2010, p. 103.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 CSHL has partnered with the [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] in [[Suzhou]], China to create '''Cold Spring Harbor Asia''' which annually draws some 3,000 scientists to its meetings and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csh-asia.org/overview.html|title=CSH Asia Overview|website=www.csh-asia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, CSHL announced a strategic affiliation with the nearby [[Northwell Health]] to  advance cancer therapeutics research, develop a new clinical cancer research unit at Northwell Health in [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], NY, to support early-phase clinical studies of new cancer therapies, and recruit and train more clinician-scientists in oncology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/news-and-features/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-and-north-shore-lij-announce-strategic-affiliation-to-accelerate-benefits-of-cancer-research-to-patients.html|title=CSHL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and North Shore-LIJ announce strategic affiliation to accelerate benefits of cancer research to patients - News &amp; Features|author=Dagnia Zeidlickis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSHL hosts [[bioRxiv]], the preprint repository for biologists.

==Educational programs==
[[File:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory sign.jpg|thumb|Sign at the entrance at 500 Sunnyside Blvd.]]
In addition to its research mission, CSHL has a broad educational mission. The Watson School of Biological Sciences (WSBS), established in 1998, awards the Ph.D. degree and fully funds the research program of every student. Students are challenged to obtain their doctoral degree in 4–5 years.  The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for gifted college students (established in 1959), and the Partners for the Future Program for advanced high school students (established in 1990) are now hosted at the WSBS.

The CSHL Meetings &amp; Courses Program brings over 8,500 scientists from around the world to Cold Spring Harbor annually to share research results – mostly unpublished—in 60 meetings, most held biannually; and to learn new technologies in 30 to 35 professional courses, most offered annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Cold Spring Harbor Symposium series, held every year since 1933 with the exception of three years during the Second World War, has been a forum for researchers in genetics, genomics, neuroscience and plant biology. At the Banbury Center, about 25-30 discussion-style meetings are held yearly for a limited number of invited participants. As of 2016 a two-week course at CSHL costs between $3,700 and $4,700 per student and a three-day conferences cost about $1,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx|title=CSHL Courses|website=meetings.cshl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA Learning Center (DNALC), founded in 1988, was among the early pioneers&lt;ref&gt;See early DNALC annual reports: 1985: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1985.pdf]; and 1988: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1988.pdf]. For the educational milieu at the time hands-on learning caught on nationally, see: Kyle, Jr. W.C., Bonnstetter, R.J., McClosky, J. &amp; Fults, B.A. (1985). "What Research Says: Science through discovery: Students love it," ''Science and Children'', 23 (2), 39-41; Lumpe, A.T. &amp; Oliver, J.S. (1991) "Dimensions of Hands-on Science," ''The American Biology Teacher'', 53 (6), 345-348; Rutherford, F. J. &amp; Ahlgren, A. (1990), ''Science for All Americans'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 186ff.; Schmieder, A.A. &amp; Michael-Dyer, G. (1991)., "State of the scene of science education in the nation," Paper presented at the Public Health Service National Conference, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; in developing hands-on genetics lab experiences for middle and high school students.  In 2013, 31,000 students on Long Island and New York City were taught genetics labs at the DNALC and satellite facilities in New York. Over 9,000 high school biology teachers have participated in DNALC teacher-training programs.&lt;ref&gt;DNA Learning Center, 2013 Annual Report, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] has established a program consisting of seven journals, 190 books, laboratory manuals and protocols, and online services for research preprints.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"/&gt;

==Funding==
In 2015, CSHL had an operating budget of $150 million, over $100 million of which was spent on research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cshl.edu/images/stories/about_us/pdfs/2013-CSHL-factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Half of the research budget was devoted to cancer; 25% to neuroscience; 15% to genomics and quantitative biology; and 10% to plant sciences.  The sources of research funding in 2015 were: 34% Federal (primarily [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Science Foundation]]); 26% auxiliary activities; 22% private philanthropy; 10% endowment; 3% corporate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Founding and early years==
The institution took root as The Biological Laboratory in 1890, a summer program for the education of college and high school teachers studying zoology, botany, comparative anatomy and nature. The program began as an initiative of Eugene G. Blackford and [[Franklin Hooper]], director of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the founding institution of [[The Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Watson |first=Edith L. |title=Houses for Science: a Pictorial History of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |year=1991 |publisher=CSHL Press, 1991 |pages=20–23 |isbn=9780879694036 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQHhyobFZfwC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] established the '''Station for Experimental Evolution''' at Cold Spring Harbor on an adjacent parcel. In 1921, the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics.

Between 1910 and 1939, the laboratory was the base of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] of biologist [[Charles B. Davenport]] and his assistant [[Harry H. Laughlin]], two prominent [[American eugenicists]] of the period.  Davenport was director of the Carnegie Station from its inception until his retirement in 1934. In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review the ERO's work, and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all work. In 1939 the Institution withdrew funding for the ERO entirely, leading to its closure. The ERO's reports, articles, charts, and pedigrees were considered scientific facts in their day, but have since been discredited. However, its closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ([[Immigration Act of 1924]]), which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who, Harry Laughlin testified, were racially inferior to the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany. Charles Davenport was also the founder and the first director of the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] in 1925. Today, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory maintains the full historical records, communications and artifacts of the ERO for historical,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Daniel J. Kevles]], ''In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1985); [[Elof A.

Carnegie Institution scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made many contributions to genetics and medicine. In 1908 [[George H. Shull]] discovered hybrid corn and the genetic principle behind it called [[heterosis]],  or "hybrid vigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LATENT CHARACTERS | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 646| pages = 792–794 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.646.792 | pmid = 17810906 | bibcode = 1907Sci....25..792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = SOME LATENT CHARACTERS OF A WHITE BEAN | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 647| pages = 828–832 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.647.828-b | pmid = 17828973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become the foundation of modern agricultural genetics.

==History==
[[Milislav Demerec]] was named director of the Laboratory in 1941. Demerec shifted the Laboratory's research focus to the genetics of microbes, thus setting investigators on a course to study the biochemical function of the gene. During World War Two, Demerec directed efforts at Cold Spring Harbor that resulted in major increases in penicillin production.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Patent 2,445,748 (July 27, 1948). Demerec used x-ray mutagenesis to produce a high-yielding strain of ''Penicillium'' mold.  This facilitated a fivefold increase in penicillin production.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1941, and annually from 1945, three of the seminal figures of molecular genetics convened summer meetings at Cold Spring Harbor of what they called the [[Phage Group]]. [[Salvador Luria]],  of Indiana University; [[Max Delbrück]],  then of Vanderbilt University; and [[Alfred Hershey]],  then of Washington University, St. Louis, sought to discover the nature of genes through study of viruses called bacteriophages that infect bacteria.

* In 1945, Delbrück's famous Phage Course was taught for the first time, inspiring, among others, a young [[James D. Watson]]; it was repeated for many years after. CSH Symposia important in the cross-fertilization of ideas among molecular biology's pioneers were held in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming of Phage: Celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Phage Course," Pamphlet, 14 pp., 1995.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;   
* At the CSH Symposium in summer 1953, Watson made the first public presentation of DNA's double-helix structure.

'''Nobel Prize winners'''
* In 1944 [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered [[transposons]] ("jumping genes"), for which she received a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/] See the classic paper McClintock B 1951 "Chromosome Organization and Genic Expression" (''Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol'' 16: 13-47).&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1952 the "Waring blender [[Hershey–Chase experiment|experiments]]" of [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] confirmed DNA as the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Hershey and Martha Chase, "Independent Functions of Viral Protein and Nucleic Acid in Growth of Bacteriophage," ''[[J. General Physiology]]'' (September 20, 1952) 36:1, 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hershey shared a Nobel Prize with Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück in 1969, "for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In 1962, the Department of Genetics, no longer supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, formally merged with the Biological Laboratory to form the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology. In 1970, the name was simplified to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

James D. Watson served as the Laboratory's director and president for 35 years. Upon  taking charge in 1968, he focused the Laboratory on cancer research, creating a tumor virus group and successfully obtaining federal funds for an expansion of cancer research capabilities. Watson placed CSHL on a firm financial footing. Inspired by his Nobel collaborator, Francis Crick, Watson initiated a major push to scale-up CSHL research on the brain and psychiatric disorders, beginning in the late 1980s.  In 1990, work was completed on the [[Arnold and Mabel Beckman]] Laboratory, and the Marks Neuroscience Building was opened in 1999.  In 1994, Watson ceased being director of the Laboratory and assumed the title of president. In 2004 he was named chancellor, a position he held until October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cshl.edu/Non-Research-Faculty/james-d-watson.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  when he  retired at the age of 79 after views attributed to him on [[race and intelligence]] appeared in the British press.&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Africans-45]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Suspension-46]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is now chancellor emeritus.

Since 1994 biochemist and cancer biologist [[Bruce Stillman]] has led the Laboratory as director, and since 2003 as president. Stillman, a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], also continues to run a basic research lab, devoted to the study of DNA replication and chromosome maintenance. Stillman is credited with the 1991 discovery and elucidation of the mechanism of the [[Origin Recognition Complex]] (ORC), a highly conserved protein complex that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences, marking starting points for replication of the entire genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8939847 | volume=274 | title=Cell cycle control of DNA replication | date=December 1996 | journal=Science | pages=1659–64 | last1 = Stillman | first1 = B | doi=10.1126/science.274.5293.1659| bibcode=1996Sci...274.1659S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stillman has presided over a major expansion of the Laboratory, its size growing threefold since he became director. With construction completed on six linked laboratory buildings on the Hillside Campus in 2009, CSHL added much-needed new laboratory space for cancer and neuroscience research, as well as space for a new program on quantitative biology to bring experts in mathematics, computer science, statistics, and physics to problems in biology.

[[File:Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (8533-35).jpg|thumb|Cologne Institute for Economic Research
Headquarters in Cologne, Germany
]]

The '''German Economic Institute''' (German: '''Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft''' Köln e.V.) ('''IW''') is a private economic research institute in Germany, which promotes a liberal economic and social order. The German Economic Institute is based in Cologne, Germany, with additional offices in Berlin, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium. 

The IW compiles analyses on economic and social policy issues. As a think tank, it combines research, consultancy and communication services. The research is based on empirical principles and sound scientific methodology. It stands for a socially responsible free market economy in German for the benefit of society as a whole. The institute’s long term goal is to support a liberal economic and social order in Germany and beyond and to improve understanding of how business and society function and interact..

The institute was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|Federation of German Industries]] (BDI). The German Economic Institute is a registered association (e.V.). Its membership consists of some 110 German business and employers' associations as well as a number of individual companies. Membership fees finance the regular scientific research and advocacy. Additionally, the institute conducts research projects and carries out numerous studies financed by third parties, such as public institutions, foundations and businesses.

==IW Group and Governance Structures==

The German Economic Institute has four subsidiaries which together constitute the IW Group. The Group is composed of the core research department (IW Research), a commercial research consultancy (IW Consult), a publishing house (IW Medien), the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme (IW Junior) and an academy (IW Akademie).
Through the organization’s decision-making bodies members contribute to the institute’s general orientation without having any specific influence on the contents of conducts research and the subsidiaries’ daily business. The annual general meeting of the executive board of the German Economic Institute elected Arndt Günter Kirchhoff, CEO of KIRCHHOFF Holding GmbH &amp; Co. KG, as its honorary president.

===IW Research===

Prof. Dr. [[Michael Hüther]] is the Director of the German Economic Institute and head of its management board. The management board consists of the Director, his Deputy Dr. Hans-Peter Fröhlich and the Heads of Research Dr. Hubertus Bardt and Dr. Hans-Peter Klös.

The Berlin Office is led by Dr. Knut Bergmann and the  Brussels Office by Sandra Parthie.

The institute’s research department itself is subdivided into eleven research units.

====Research Units====
* '''Labour Market''' - main focus on employment and unemployment, working conditions and personnel policy.
* '''Vocational qualification and specialists''' – Vocational training, further education, securing skilled personnel and international VET/PET research
* '''Vocational Rehabilitation and Inclusion''' - information resources for maximising the potential of workers with disabilities
* '''Education, Migration and Innovation''' – examining how education and migration contribute to securing a skilled workforce.
* '''Financial and Real Estate Markets''' – monitoring and researching the economic significance of the finance and real estate markets
* '''International Economics and Economic Outlook''' – promoting open markets and sensible business regulation at the European and global levels as well as analyzing the business cycle, economic growth and globalisation and provide advice for policymakers and business associations
* '''Public Finance, Social Security Systems, Income and Wealth Distribution''' – investigating the fiscal consequences of public policy and analysing the incentive effects for companies and private households
* '''Structural Change and Competition''' – monitoring corporate activity in a constantly changing market environment 
* '''Wage Policy and Industrial Relations''' – pay and industrial relations issues including policy, corporate codetermination, the process of the wage finding and the roles of the parties involved
* '''Environment, Energy, Infrastructure''' – examining the effects of economic activity on the environment and the effects of environmental and energy policy on business
* '''Behavioral Economics and Business Ethics''' – investigating the influence of institutions such as values, standards, rules and laws on the state, society, business and individuals

====Cross Functional Research Groups====

Additionally to the eleven research units there are two cross functional research groups staffed by researchers working on the following two issues:
* Big Data Analytics 
* Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecast 
* Microdata and Method Development

===IW Consult===

The IW Consult carries out research, development and knowledge-transfer projects in cooperation with companies, employers' associations, government ministries, foundations and other institutions. IW Consult also runs the office of “ecl@ss”, a digital product standard.

===IW Medien===

Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln Medien GmbH (IW Media), the media arm of the German Economic Institute (IW), provides publicity-oriented packaging of economic information.The weekly newsletter, Informationsdienst des Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (iwd), carries articles on economics, society, and social policy, as well as analyses and economic data.

===IW Junior===

The Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln JUNIOR gGmbH is the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme. It gives school students practical insights into the world of commerce based on the concept of ”learning by doing”.

===IW Akademie===

The IW Akademie (IW Academy) conducts seminars in the field of executive education based on its research. The aim is to demonstrate how potential conflicts between the profit motive and personal conscience can be resolved. Additionally, the IW Academy offers a Master’s programme "Behavioral Ethics, Economics and Psychology (M.A.)" in collaboration with the University of Cologne, the Cologne University of Applied Sciences and Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University.

'''Common knowledge''' is [[knowledge]] that is known by everyone or nearly everyone, usually with reference to the [[community]] in which the term is used. Common knowledge need not concern one specific subject, e.g., [[science]] or [[history]]. Rather, common knowledge can be about a broad range of subjects, such as science, literature, history, and entertainment. Often, common knowledge does not need to be [[citation|cited]]. Common knowledge is distinct from [[general knowledge]]. The latter has been defined by differential psychologists as referring to "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media", and is considered an aspect of ability related to intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Richard |author2=Irwing, P. |author3=Cammock, T.|title=Sex differences in general knowledge|journal=Intelligence|year=2001|volume=30|pages=27–39|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289601000642|doi=10.1016/S0160-2896(01)00064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there are substantial individual differences in general knowledge as opposed to common knowledge.

In broader terms, common knowledge is used to refer to information that a reader would accept as valid, such as information that many users may know.  As an example, this type of information may include the temperature in which water freezes or boils. To determine if information should be considered common knowledge, you can ask yourself who your audience is, are you able to assume they already have some familiarity with the topic, or will the information’s credibility come into question.

Many techniques have been developed in response to the question of distinguishing truth from fact in matters that have become "common knowledge". The [[scientific method]] is usually applied in cases involving phenomena associated with astronomy, mathematics, physics, and the general laws of nature. In legal settings, [[rules of evidence]] generally exclude [[hearsay]] (which may draw on "facts" someone believes to be "common knowledge").

"[[Conventional wisdom]]" is a similar term also referring to ostensibly pervasive knowledge or analysis.

== Examples ==
Examples of common knowledge:

* "[[Paris]] is the capital of [[France]]." Many capital cities of countries are considered common knowledge by most people.
* "The Moon orbits the Earth." Observation of the moon shows us that this happens. In addition, [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|scientific findings give confirmation]]. At various periods in history, it was regarded as common knowledge that the Earth is flat and that the Sun orbits the Earth, although these theories were later found to be false.
* "It is dangerous to mix [[ammonia]] and [[bleach]]." Though both common household chemicals, accidents involving the mixing of ammonia and bleach are rare, because the potentially lethal danger in their chemical reaction is a widely circulated cautionary tale.
* "The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] grants American citizens the right to refuse to answer any question in a court of law that would endanger incriminating themselves." "Pleading the Fifth" is a phrase commonly used in American colloquial speak, and even in such popular media as the sketch comedy series ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. Thus it may be regarded as common knowledge in the United States.

The '''conservation and restoration of insect specimens''' is the process of caring for and preserving insects as a part of a collection. Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.

== Collection ==
[[File:Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay with Ernst Hackel 1866.jpg|left|thumb|261x261px]]
[[Insect collecting]] can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A [[kill jar]] is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.

== Preparation ==
The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible.

=== Pinning ===
[[File:Neduba morsei, female, lateral view.jpg|thumb]]
The process of '''pinning''' insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological equipment]] to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StagedandCardedInsects.jpg|left|thumb]]

=== Carding ===
'''Carding''' is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular point is cut from acid free card to ensure best conservation practice because it comes in direct contact with the specimen. A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens.

=== Wet specimen ===
A '''wet specimen''' is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slides ===
Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.

== Core aspects of conservation ==
The [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) describes in their [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice.pdf?sfvrsn=9 Code of Ethics] the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens.

=== Preventive conservation ===
Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M Agrilife Extension, (n.d.) [http://bughunter.tamu.edu/preservation/preservationconsider/ Bug hunter: Preservation considerations] Retrieved 2017-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; but much of this is avoidable when proper [[preventive conservation]] practices are followed.

==== Routine cleaning ====
In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a [[stereo microscope]] for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.&lt;ref&gt;Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). [http://extreme-macro.co.uk/cleaning-insects/ How to clean insects] Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proper storage ====
A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by [[relative humidity]] (RH)  and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. ''Collection Forum, 27(1-2),'' 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Safe handling ====
Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11080 Tribolium destructor False black flour beetle.jpg|thumb|156x156px|The flour beetle, a common pest affecting dried insect specimens.]]

==== Integrated pest management ====
'''[[Integrated Pest Management (for museums)|Integrated pest management]]''' (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). ''Museum registration methods 5th edition''. Washington, DC: The AAM Press&lt;/ref&gt; All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and  monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), [https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/ccinotesicc/3-3_e.pdf Controlling insect pests with low temperature] ''CCI Notes'' Retrieved 2017-04-08&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[inert gases]] may be used for an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] [[fumigation]] - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examination  ===
[[File:Isoparce cupressi sjh.JPG|left|thumb|322x322px|Verdigris is present near the pin and an antennae is missing.]]
Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, B. (2010). ''Conservation treatment methodology.'' San Bernardino, CA. {{ISBN|1453682112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.

==== Common agents of deterioration ====
* Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens.
* Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. 
* Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.&lt;ref&gt;Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, [http://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_zoological_specimens.pdf Care and conservation of zoological specimens] Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentation ===
The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.

==== Labeling ====
As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, J., Dec. 1992, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN8_Nov1992.pdf Insect collection conservation] ''Insect collection news No. 8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 3289 A pinned Australian sheep blowfly.jpg|left|thumb|145x145px]]

==== Photographing and digitization ====
With improvements in [[digital photography]] and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts.

[[File:Odonata aeshnidae adult.jpg|thumb|Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.]]

==== Illustrating ====
[[Scientific illustration]] of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). ''The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Description of the state of the specimen and treatments ====
This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators. 
[[File:Life cycle of ticks family ixodidae.PNG|thumb|Researching ticks helps develop health guidelines against the diseases they spread.]]

=== Research ===
Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. H., 1962, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33935348 How to collect and preserve insects] p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration. Research of the insect collections in museums can lead to new discoveries of species,&lt;ref&gt;Entomology Today, July, 2106, [https://entomologytoday.org/2016/07/12/new-assassin-bug-species-discovered-in-museum-collections-and-in-the-field/ New assassin bug species discovered in museum collections and in the field] ''Entomology Today'' Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; and provide an important historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Entomological Society of America, Jan. 2016, [http://www.entsoc.org/PDF/2016/ESA-PolicyStatement-EntomologicalCollections.pdf ESA position statement on the importance of entomological collections] Retrieved 2017-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment === 
Once a close observation reveals what issues are present in insect collections, the conservator makes a decision on actions to be taken. It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service, 2006, [https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-08.pdf Curation of insect specimens] ''Conserve O Gram 11/8'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, D., Dec. 1995, [http://entomology.si.edu/Collections/ICN1-10/ICN10-Dec1995.pdf Pest control in entomological collections] ''Insect collection news No. 10'' Retrieved 2017-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will "relax" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented.

=== Education ===
Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor artworks''' is the activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of artworks that are exhibited or permanently installed outside. These works may be made of [[Wood art|wood]], [[Stone sculpture|stone]], [[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|ceramic material]], [[Plastic arts|plastic]], [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|bronze]], [[Conservation and restoration of copper-based objects|copper]], or any other number of materials and may or may not be painted.  When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].
[[File:Applying wax to a bronze sculpture.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist [[Brose Partington]] applies wax using a torch to a bronze sculpture.]]

==Environmental issues==
Unlike many works of [[cultural heritage]], outdoor artworks are not exhibited in a controlled environment, where [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] are closely monitored.  Though works may be more easily preserved in a controlled environment, they are installed outside to preserve the [[Artist's statement|artist's intent]], and avoid decontextualization.&lt;ref name="Chiantore"&gt;Chiantore, Oscar, and A. Rava. (2005).  ''Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, outdoor works are exposed to many and various [[environmental factors]] depending upon its geographic or site location and its configuration.&lt;ref name = "Naude"&gt;Naudė, Virginia N. (1985). ''Sculptural Monuments in an Outdoor Environment''.  Philadelphia, PA: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental threats may include, but are not limited to rain, snow, [[acid rain]], and earthquakes as well as fluctuations in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]].  They may also be exposed to excessive amounts of light as well as human intervention. Excessive rain and moisture can also lead to mold growth.  Daily exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]], [[Visible light|visible]], and [[Infrared light|infrared (IR)]] radiation has a detrimental effect on painted sculptures or those with organic or inorganic coatings. Excessive light exposure may cause color alterations and loss as well as structural breakdowns in the paint and coatings.&lt;ref name="Consodine"&gt;Considine, Brian B. (2010). ''Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center''. Los Angeles, CA: The Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air pollution]] can also adversely affect outdoor artworks.  In addition to meteorological conditions, traditional outdoor pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and [[ozone]] affect the various composite materials.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"&gt;Grzywacz, Cecily M. (2006). ''Monitoring for Gaseous Pollutants in Museum Environments''.  Tools for Conservation.  Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific level and type of air pollution degradation is dependent on the material and composition of the artwork as well as the length of exposure. Organic carbonyl pollutants are also an increasing threat due increased use of ethanol based fuels.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"/&gt;

==Contemporary conservation methods==
Though specific conservation methods are dependent on the material, condition, and environment for each artwork, there are some standard practices for outdoor works. These include condition assessment, treatment, [[preventive conservation]], and maintenance.

===Assessment of condition===
Before any conservation treatment, a thorough condition assessment with written and photographic documentation is completed.  This initial assessment may include research into the artist's working techniques or a discussion with the living artist, review of the conservation history of the object, and non-destructive analysis.

According to Virginia Naudé and Glenn Wharton, there are four steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture:&lt;ref&gt;Naudé, Virginia N. (1993). ''Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture''. Washington, D.C.: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Technical descriptions and condition assessments of each sculpture''': Identification and exploration of materials, fabrication, past maintenance practices, surface condition, and structural integrity. This also includes an assessment of previous repairs, treatment and/or maintenance.
# '''Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture''': Recommendations based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection. The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment.
# '''Assignment of priorities to recommended activities''': [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]]-assigned priorities based on the previously attained technical information. These priorities will later be assessed by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities.
# '''Estimate of resources required''': Includes labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed for conservators, technicians, and other specialists. An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately. Supplies and equipment costs are also included.
 
===Treatment of outdoor artworks===
The treatment of outdoor artworks is multifaceted and dependent on the material type, condition, structural integrity, and exhibition conditions. A brief overview of conservation treatments by material is outlined below, and more thorough discussions are available on the individual conservation pages.

* [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|Bronze sculptures]]: For many bronze sculptures and other metal sculptures, treatment includes a reduction buildup from previous protective coatings, removal of corrosion and incrustation, or cleaning.  This may be done by hand, water blasting, air abrasion, or other methods.  Then, a wax or wax composite is applied to the sculpture in sweeping motions.  Finally, the wax is buffed with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Kipper, Patrick V. (1996). ''The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the Collector''. Loveland, CO: Path Publications. {{ISBN|0964726912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|Ceramic sculptures]]: Ceramic sculptures are much less common than bronze sculptures, and require a different conservation and maintenance procedures.  Mechanical and chemical cleaning methods may be used, and previous conservation treatments and adhesives may be removed.  Next, consolidation of fragments and flaking glaze may be completed.  For sculptures comprised with multiple ceramic parts joined with mortar, the grout may also require conservation intervention.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;
*[[Plastic arts|Plastic sculptures]]:  Plastic elements are prevalent in contemporary sculptures.  Outdoor sculptures may be made entire or in part of [[polyester]], [[epoxy]], [[phenol]], or [[Acrylic resin|acrylic materials]].&lt;ref name="Chiantore"/&gt; Unfortunately, treatment for plastic sculptures may be limited as some changes from degradation in plastics are not reversible.
*Painted sculptures:  As Brian Consodine writes, painted sculptures are actually a multi-layered composition that can contain [[primer (paint)|primer]]s, [[paints]], and [[protective coatings]] as well as the structural substrate.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;  Problems that may occur with painted sculptures include degradation or alteration of color, cracking and flaking of paint, and failure of the primer layer which exposes the underlying primary support to the elements.  Treatments for painted sculptures may include reduction of previous coatings and repairs, cleaning, consolidation, and inpainting of losses.

===Preventive conservation===
[[File:Tool used to maintain a bronze sculpture.JPG|thumb|Wax and a brush used to maintain a bronze sculpture.]]
[[Preventive conservation]] involves actions taken to delay deterioration of [[cultural heritage]].  For outdoor artworks, this usually involves the application of a protective coating and regular maintenance.  The particular protective coating is chosen based on its durability, adhesion to the surface, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance on the work.&lt;ref name="Naude"/&gt; The coating provides some protection from [[environmental factors]], but must be occasionally be reduced and reapplied for best results.  A long-term conservation schedule should be created and implemented to ensure the longevity of the artwork.  A maintenance walk-through schedule should also be established to routinely check the condition of the objects.  This may be a weekly procedure; it is useful as conservators can assess and document any damage caused by visitors or environmental conditions, and may rinse and wipe down sculptures.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2012">A '''corpus language''' is a language without living speakers, while a number of the actual productions of the native speakers have been preserved in some way (usually in written records).&lt;ref&gt;Langslow, D.R. 2002 "Approaching bilingualism in corpus languages" in James Noel Adams, Mark Janse, Simon Swain (edd.) ''Bilingualism in Ancient Society: Language Contact and the Written Text'' Oxford: OUP&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of corpus languages are [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]], the [[Egyptian Language]], [[Old English]] and [[Elamite language|Elamite]]. 

Some corpus language left a very large corpus, like [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]], and therefore can be totally reconstucted, even though some details of the pronunciation may be unclear. Such languages can be used even today, as is the case with [[Sanskrit]] and Latin. Others have such a limited corpus that some important words, e.g. some pronouns, are not found in the corpus. Examples for this are [[Ugaritic]] and [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. Languages that are only attested by a few words, often names, and a few phrases (called ''Trümmersprachen'' in German linguistics, literally "rubble languages") can only be reconstructed in a very limited way and often their [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] to other languages remains unclear. Examples are the [[Lombardic language]] and [[Dadanitic]], a [[Semitic language]] that is may be close to [[classical Arabic]].

Corpus languages are studied using the methods of [[corpus linguistics]], but corpus linguistics can be used (and is commonly used) for the study of the recorded productions of living languages.

Not all [[extinct language]]s are "corpus languages," since many languages have disappeared leaving no, or very inadequate, recorded production of their speakers.

The '''Department of Mathematics and Statistics''' is an [[academic department]] at [[McGill University]]. It is located in [[Burnside Hall]] at McGill's downtown campus in [[Montreal]].

==History==
Mathematics was taught at McGill as early as 1848 when it was a discipline of [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Arts and Science|chapter-url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol1/rg32.htm|title=Guide to Archives Resources at McGill University|volume=1|year=1985|isbn=0-7717-0117-9|editor-first=Marcel|editor-last=Caya|publisher=McGill University Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics at McGill was initially divided into two largely independent departments, one under the [[McGill University Faculty of Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]] and another under the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]]; the two departments merged in 1924 under the chairmanship of [[Daniel Murray (mathematician)|Daniel Murray]].{{r|genest|p=406}} Still, mathematics remained subsidiary to other programs, owing to McGill's emphasis on [[engineering]] and British-style [[applied mathematics]].{{r|mathcan|page=105}} Until 1945, Mathematics was almost wholly a service department with only seven faculty members. Though a small graduate program was shared with the Physics Department, most of the students in the program were headed for further graduate work in physics.{{r|learning|p=342}}

In 1945, Department members Lloyd Williams and Gordon Pall founded the [[Canadian Mathematical Society|Canadian Mathematical Congress]], which took the lead in persuading the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] to make funds available for the support of [[pure mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1523|encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|volume=2|editor-first=Ivor|editor-last=Grattan-Guiness|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1994|isbn=0-415-09239-6|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZptYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1523|title=Mathematics in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as chairman of the Department, A. H. S. Gillon initiated in 1945 an Applied Mathematics program and in 1948 recommended for appointment to a professorship [[Hans Zassenhaus]], a pure mathematician who began to attract a number of strong graduate students into his program. Zassenhaus, along with Professors Wacław Kozakiewicz, [[Charles Fox (mathematician)|Charles Fox]], Edward Rosenthall, and [[P. R. Wallace|Phil Wallace]], was instrumental in developing the Department's Graduate School.{{r|genest|p=409}} McGill's first mathematics [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] was awarded to [[Joachim Lambek]], who obtained his doctorate in 1950 under Zassenhaus's supervision.&lt;ref name=scimeeting&gt;{{cite conference|date=2 December 2014|conference=Faculty of Science: Meeting of Faculty|location=Montreal|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/science/files/science/facultyagendadocuments-december_2_2014-_one_file_combined_0.pdf|title=Resolution on the Death of Emeritus Professor Joachim (Jim) Lambek, Department of Mathematics and Statistics|first=Henri|last=Darmon|author-link=Henri Darmon|publisher=[[McGill University]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, as public funds came to the university and a larger budget became available, the newly appointment chairman, Edward Rosenthall, concentrated on building a balanced and well-qualified academic team, which could sustain a vigorous graduate program along with the demands made upon the Department in a service capacity. [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] and [[algebra]] became strong elements in the Department's program in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and there was also a lively interest in [[statistics]] and in [[applied mathematics]].{{r|learning|page=343}} Research in [[category theory]] began in 1966, when Lambek decided to promote the subject at McGill.&lt;ref name=bunge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Category Theory at McGill, 1966-2006 (A Personal View)|first=Marta|last=Bunge|authorlink=Marta Bunge|location=Montreal|date=January 2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274635769_Category_Theory_at_McGill_1966-2006_A_personal_view}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of full-time staff in the Department had grown to 36 by 1960, and to 56 by 1970.{{r|learning|page=362}} 

The Departmental library was established in 1971, and dedicated in 1987 in honour of Edward Rosenthall.&lt;ref name=rosenthal&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Rosenthall Mathematics and Statistics Library|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/historicalcollections/library-archival/edward-rosenthall|website=Historical Collections|publisher=McGill University|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its closure in 2015, the Rosenthall Library held over 14,000 [[Scientific journal|mathematics journals]] dating from the nineteenth century, more than 10,000 [[monograph]]s, as well as a collection of rare mathematics books.{{r|rosenthal}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rosenthall Library|date=24 January 2016|first=Jason|last=Polak|website=Aleph Zero Categorical|url=http://blog.jpolak.org/?p=1647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music theory]], the '''descending tetrachord''' is a series of four notes from a [[scale (music)|scale]], or [[tetrachord]], arranged in order from highest to lowest, or descending order. For example, &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|8}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|7}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|6}}&lt;/sub&gt;- &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|5}}&lt;/sub&gt;, as created by the [[Andalusian cadence]]. The descending tetrachord may fill a [[perfect fourth]] or a [[chromatic fourth]].

'''Digital Media Academy''' (commonly referred to as "DMA") is a [[digital art]] and technology education company, located in [[Los Gatos]], CA, primarily offering art and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] [[summer camp]] programs for kids, age 6-18, at several universities in the US and Canada, including [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[New York University|NYU]], [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], [[University of Toronto|UoT]], among other prestigious ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/#locations Digital Media Academy Website - Locations]&lt;/ref&gt; DMA now also licenses curriculum and other STEM resources to schools internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/tools-for-educators/|title=Tools for Educators - Digital Media Academy|work=Digital Media Academy|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMA was officially incorporated in 2002,  but was incubated at [[Stanford University]] in the late 1990s as the Academy for New Media, a program of Stanford's Academic Computing department. The Academy for New Media was created at Stanford by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-gibson-247a966/ Phil Gibson] in 1999 as an outreach to K-12 educators and high-school students interested in learning the latest digital media software tools from award-winning creative professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/june20/newmedia-620.html Stanford Report], June 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In Fall 2001, the Academy for New Media fell victim to University budget cuts and the program was transitioned away from Stanford to a private entity – and Digital Media Academy was born. The [[Stanford University]] Continuing Studies department offered CEU credit through Digital Media Academy from 2002-2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/adults/courses/certification-dma-credits.html Digital Media Academy Website - Certifications and Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;
Students may attend Digital Media Academy summer camps with the [[day camp]] or residential camp option.  These camps offer sports and recreation, while being known as a [[tech camp]] primarily.

==Program offerings==

DMA designs, develops, and delivers STEM curriculum for students of all ages. Digital Media Academy summer tech camps offer kids 6-17 and adults the opportunity to learn a variety of tech and new media skills in topics including Programming &amp; Coding, 3D Printing &amp; Product Design, Filmmaking, Photography, Game Design &amp; Development, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Graphic Design, 3D Modeling, Animation, Robotics, and Wearable Tech. For schools and educators, DMA offers curriculum licensing, professional development, mentoring and support. DMA has been an [[Apple Inc.]] Authorized Training Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.apple.com/locations?q=Stanford&amp;c=all&amp;country=all Apple Website - Apple Authorized Training Center Listings]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adobe Systems]] Training Partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/education/community/partners.html Adobe Systems Website - Adobe Education Partners]&lt;/ref&gt; For youth, DMA offers summer computer camps, including sleep away camps at top universities throughout the United States and Canada, including its flagship location at Stanford University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/locations/ Digital Media Academy Website - Locations and Dates].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flash fiction''' is a fictional work of extreme brevity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://shortstories.about.com/od/Flash/a/What-Is-Flash-Fiction.htm|title=What Is Flash Fiction?|author=Catherine Sustana|date=|work=About Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; that still offers character and plot development.  Identified varieties, many of them defined by [[word count]], include the [[For sale: baby shoes, never worn|six-word story]],&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bridportprize.org.uk/blog/flash-fiction-all-you-ever-wanted-know-were-afraid-ask|author=Graham|date=  March 8, 2013|work=The Bridport Prize|title=Flash fiction - all you ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask...}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 280-character story (also known as "[[twitterature]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/twitter-fiction_n_7205686|author=Maddie Crum|date=  May 7, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|title=Twitter Fiction Reveals The Power Of Very, Very Short Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the "dribble" (also known as the "[[minisaga]]"; 50 words),&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; the "[[drabble]]" (also known as "microfiction"; 100 words),&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; "sudden fiction" (750 words),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/publishing-tips/flash-fiction-whats-it-all-about|author=Becky Tuch |date=|work=The Review Review|title=Flash Fiction: What's It All About?}}&lt;/ref&gt; flash fiction (1,000 words), nanotale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theanonymouswriter.com/nanotales/|title=Nanotales|last=Chakraborty|first=Abhijit|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "micro-story".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Two Micro-Stories by [[Bolesław Prus]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, pp. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some commentators have suggested that flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality, in its ability to hint at or imply a larger story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smokelong.com/why-flash-fiction-because-of-a-parrot-and-a-porn-star-of-course/#_edn3|title=Why Flash Fiction? Because of a Parrot and a Porn Star, Of Course|author=Ashley Chantler|date=|work=Smokelong Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swartwood, Robert, "Hint Fiction", (New York: W.W. Norton, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Flash fiction has roots going back to prehistory, recorded at origin of writing, including [[fable]]s and [[parable]]s, notably ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' in the west, and [[Panchatantra]] and [[Jataka tales]] in India. Later examples include the tales of [[Nasreddin]], and [[Zen]] [[koan]]s such as ''[[The Gateless Gate]]''.

In the United States, early forms of flash fiction can be found in the 19th century, notably in the figures of [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], and [[Kate Chopin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Specimen Fiction: The 19th Century Tradition of the American Short-Short Story Critical Essay with Creative Work |last=Roth |first=Forrest Stephen
|type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Louisiana at Lafayette |year=2013 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/90/3590051.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s flash fiction was referred to as the "short short story" and was associated with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine; and in the 1930s, collected in anthologies such as ''The American Short Short Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofw2AQAAIAAJ |title=The American Short Short Story - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Somerset Maugham]] was a notable proponent, with his ''Cosmopolitans: Very Short Stories'' (1936) being an early collection. 

In Japan, flash fiction was popularized in the post-war period particularly by {{Nihongo|Michio Tsuzuki|[[:ja:都筑道夫|都筑道夫]]}}.

==Authors==
Practitioners have included [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]] of Shiraz ("[[Gulistan of Sa'di]]"), [[Bolesław Prus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Two Micro-Stories by [[Bolesław Prus]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, pp. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Chekhov]], [[O. Henry]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[H.P. Lovecraft]], [[Yasunari Kawabata]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Daniil Kharms]]&lt;ref&gt;Branislav Jakovljevic, ''Daniil Kharms: Writing and the Event'' (Northwestern UP, 2009), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Richard Brautigan]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[Robert Sheckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2011/1026/1224306493734.html |title=Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive' |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hemingway also wrote 18 pieces of flash fiction that were included in his first short-story collection, ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]''. It is disputed whether (to win a bet), as alleged, he also wrote the flash fiction "[[For sale: baby shoes, never worn|For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/babyshoes.asp |title=Ernest Hemingway - Baby Shoes |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also notable are the 62 "short-shorts" which comprise ''Severance,'' the thematic collection by [[Robert Olen Butler]] in which each story describes the remaining 90 seconds of conscious awareness within human heads which have been decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/books/review/Barbash.t.html?_r=0|title=Dead Heads|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English speaking writers well known for their published flash fiction include [[Lydia Davis]], [[David Gaffney]] and [[Robert Scotellaro]] and online include [[Sherrie Flick]], [[Bruce Holland Rogers]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Barbara Henning]], [[Grant Faulkner]], and [[Nancy Stohlman]].

Spanish-speaking literature has many authors of microstories, including [[Augusto Monterroso]] ("El dinosaurio") and [[Luis Felipe Lomelí]] ("[[El emigrante (short story)|El Emigrante]]"). Their microstories are some of the shortest ever written in that language. In Spain, authors of ''microrrelatos'' (very short fictions) have included [[Andrés Neuman]], [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]], [[José Jiménez Lozano]], [[Javier Tomeo]], [[José María Merino]], [[Juan José Millás]], and [[Óscar Esquivias]].&lt;ref name="Vall2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Valls|first=Fernando|title=Mar de pirañas|url=http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/filandon/las-voces-del-microrrelato_735678.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2012|publisher=Menoscuarto|isbn=8496675890|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his collection ''La mitad del diablo'' (Páginas de Espuma, 2006), [[:es:Juan Pedro Aparicio|Juan Pedro Aparicio]] included the one-word story [[:es:Luis XIV|Luis XIV]], which in its entirety reads: "Yo" ("I"). In Argentina, notable contemporary contributors to the genre have included [[Marco Denevi]], [[Luisa Valenzuela]], and [[Ana María Shua]].

The Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]] consciously searched for a short narrative form, drawing inspiration from Argentine writers [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and finding that Monterroso's was "the most perfect he could find"; "El dinosaurio", in turn, possibly inspired his "The Dinosaurs".&lt;ref name="Weiss1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Beno|title=Italo Calvino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRewK6x7HQUC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=9 November 2012|year=1993|publisher=U of South Carolina P|isbn=9780872498587|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and [[Francophone]] countries, ''micronouvelles'' have been popularized by authors such as [[Jacques Fuentealba]] and [[Vincent Bastin]].&lt;ref&gt;Irène Langlet, "Les Echelles de bâti de la science-fiction," in ''Revue française de Fixxion contemporaine - Critical Review of Contemporary Franch Fixxion'', n° 1, ''Micro/Macro,'' 2011 and Cristina Alvarez, "Nouveaux genres littéraires urbains - les nouvelles en trois lignes contemporaines au sein des micronouvelles," in ''Atas do Simpósio Internacional : Microcontos e outras microformas,'' Minho (Portugal), {{ISBN|978-972-8063-65-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German-language authors of ''Kürzestgeschichten,'' influenced by brief narratives penned by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Franz Kafka]], have included [[Peter Bichsel]], [[Heimito von Doderer]], [[Günter Kunert]], and [[Helmut Heißenbüttel]].

The [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking world has produced a number of micro-story authors, including the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Egyptian author [[Naguib Mahfouz]], whose book ''Echoes of an Autobiography'' is composed mainly of such stories. Other flash fiction writers in Arabic include [[Zakaria Tamer]], [[Haidar Haidar]], and [[Laila al-Othman]].

In the Russian-speaking world the best known flash fiction author is [[Linor Goralik]].

In the southwestern [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Kerala]] [[:ml:പി.കെ._പാറക്കടവ്|PK Parakkadavu]] is known for his many micro-stories in the [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through the Mini-Looking Glass|last=Parakkadavu|first=PK|publisher=Lead Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kozhikode|pages=|translator-last=VK Sreelesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
A number of print journals dedicate themselves to flash fiction. These include ''Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hassacc.com/archive/?vid=1&amp;aid=3&amp;kid=150201-19&amp;q=f1.|title=Flash Fiction: Literary fast food or a metamodern (sub)genre with potential?|author=Bente Lucht|date=November 17, 2014|work=Human And Social Sciences at the Common Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vestal Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/publishing-tips/flash-fiction-list-resources|title=Flash Fiction: A List of Resources|author=Becky Tuch|date=|work=The Review Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Access to the Internet has enhanced an awareness of flash fiction, with online journals being devoted entirely to the style. ''SmokeLong Quarterly'', founded by Dave Clapper in 2003, is "dedicated to bringing the best flash fiction to the web ... whether written by widely published authors or those new to the craft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Smoke Break: Guest Editors Choose Flash Fiction for Online Mag|last = Hart|first = Melissa|date = March 2016|journal = The Writer (Retrieved 2016-02-11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other online flash fiction journals include ''wigleaf'', ''Flash Fiction Online'' and ''Flash Fiction Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt |first=Mary K. |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/164355/how_technology_is_changing_what_we_read.html |title=How Technology Is Changing What We Read |publisher=PCWorld |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A comprehensive list of online magazines accepting flash fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dlshirey.com/the-short-list/|title=The Short List|author=DL Shirey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Paulo Coelho]] remarked that the "democratization of communication offered by the Internet has made positive in-roads" and directly influenced the style's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/15/short.stories/index.html |title=Six of the best: CNN readers tell us their stories | date=2008-08-18 |publisher=Cnn.com| accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form is popular, with most online literary journals now publishing flash fiction.

Social media has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Anonymous Writer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9rKkPPIbs|title=The Anonymous Writer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Third Word Press]] using flash-fiction to create stories on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/LIF-satirical-lines-showing-indian-hypocrisy-5088229-PHO.html|title=6 nanotales by anonymous writers show reality of Indian hypocrisy!|date=2015-08-19|work=DailyBhaskar|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/featured-blog/micro-fiction-the-new-age-writing-fad/1075708|title=Micro fiction: The new-age writing fad {{!}} Free Press Journal|website=www.freepressjournal.in|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ran a series of flash fiction [http://www.newyorker.com/books/flash-fiction stories] online.

On the proposal of [[Jules Vuillemin]], a chair in the department of Philosophy and History was created at [[Collège de France]] to replace the late [[Jean Hyppolite]]. The title of the new chair was ''The history of systems of thought'' and it was created on 30 November 1969. Vuillemin put forward the then-little known outside the shores of France-philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] - to the general assembly of professors and Foucault was duly elected on 12 April 1970. He was 44 years old. As required by this appointment he held a series of public lectures from 1970 until his death in 1984. These lectures in which he further advanced his work, were summarised from audio recordings and edited by Michel Senellart. They were subsequently translated into English and further edited by Graham Burchell and published posthumously by St Martin's Press.

==''Lectures On The Will To Know'' (1970–1971)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This was an important time for Foucault and marks an important switch of methodology from ‘archaeology’ to ‘genealogy’ (according to Foucault he never abandoned the archaeology method). This was also a period of transition of thought for Foucault; the Dutch TV-televised Foucault [[Noam Chomsky]] ''Human nature Justice versus Power debate'' of November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology appears at this exact time period as his first inaugural lecture were delivered at the [[Collège de France]] entitled "the Order Of Discourse" delivered on 2 December 1970 (translated and published into English as "The Discourse On Language") then a week later (9 December 1970) his first ever full inaugural lecture course was delivered at the Collège de France "The Will to Knowledge" course Foucault promised to explore; "fragment by fragment," the "morphology of the will to knowledge," through alternating historical periods, inquiries and theoretical questioning. The lectures produced were called "Lectures On The Will To Know"; all of this within a space of a year.

The first phase of Foucault’s thought is characterized by knowledge construction of various types and how each thread of knowledge systems combine together to produce a series of networks (Foucault uses the term ‘Grille’) to produce a successful fully functional ‘subject’ and a workable fully functional human society. Foucault uses the terms ''[[epistemological]] indicators'' and ''epistemological breaks'' to show, contrary to popular opinion, that these "indicators" and "breaks" require skilled trained technical group of ‘specialists’ in the various knowledge fields and a trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body of which know-how on behalf of those who use the terms (discourse formations or "speech/discourse") with a professional body that can make the terms used stand up to further rational scrutiny. Scientific knowledge for Foucault isn’t an advancement for human progress as is so often portrayed by the human sciences (such as the humanities and the social sciences) but is much more of a subtle method of organizing and producing firstly an individual subject, and secondly, a fully functional society functioning as a self-replicated control apparatus not as a group of ‘free’ atomized individuals but as a collective societal, organised (or drilled) unit both in terms of industrial [[Economics|Production]], [[labour power]] and a militarily organized unit (in the guise of armies) which is beneficial for the production of "epistemological indicators" or "breaks" enabling society to "control itself" rather than have external factors (such as the state for example) to do the job.

In the inaugural lecture course "The Will To Know" Foucault goes into detail on how the ‘natural order of things’ from the 16th century transpired into a fully organised human society which includes a "[[Governmentality]]" apparatus and a complex machine (by "governmentaility", Foucault means a state apparatus which is conceived as a scientific machine) as a rational organizing principle. This was the first time (contrary to popular opinion that this was a rather late invention in Foucault’s thought) that Foucault started to go into the Greek dimensions of his thought of which he would return to in later lectures towards the end of his life. First of all a few pointers should be made explicit on certain points. Foucault mentions the western notion of by [[money]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] (Greek society) starting about 800 BCE to 700 BCE. However, other ‘non-western’ societies also had these very same problems and is automatically assumed by some historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} that these were entirely western inventions. This isn’t entirely true; [[China]] and [[India]] for example had the most sophisticated trading and monetary institutions by the 6th century B.C.E., indeed the concept of a ''[[corporation]]'' existed in India&lt;ref&gt;[[Chanakya]] [[Arthashastra]] Translated by R Shamasastry pp. 541–547&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 800 BCE and lasted until at least 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;"The examination reveals that business people on the Indian subcontinent utilized the corporate form from a very early period. The corporate form (e.g., the [[Shreni]]) was being used in India from at least 800 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, and was in more or less continuous
use since then until the advent of the Islamic invasions around 1000 A.D.
This provides evidence for the use of the corporate form centuries before the earliest Roman proto-corporations.
In fact, the use of the sreni in Ancient India was widespread including virtually
every kind of business, political and municipal activity. Moreover, when we examine how
these entities were structured, governed and regulated we find that they bear many
similarities to corporations and, indeed, to modern US corporations. The familiar concerns
of agency costs and incentive effects are both present and addressed in quite similar ways as
are many other aspects of the law regulating business entities. Further, examining the
historical development of the sreni indicates that the factors leading to the growth of this
corporate form are consistent with those put forward for the growth of organizational
entities in Europe. These factors include increasing trade, methods to contain agency costs,
and methods to patrol the boundaries between the assets of the sreni and those of its
members (i.e., to facilitate asset partitioning and reduce creditor information costs)." Vikramaditya S. Khanna ''The Economic History Of The Corporate Form In Ancient India 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly there was a [[social security]] system in India at this time. Foucault begins his notions from these lectures on the very notion of truth and the ‘Will to knowledge’ and the challenge is on when Foucault asks the very question of the entire western philosophical and political tradition: Namely knowledge (at least scientific knowledge) and its close association with truth is entirely desirable and is politically and philosophically natural and neutral. First of all Foucault puts these notions (at least its political notions) to a thorough test, firstly, Foucault asks the politically ‘neutral’ question on the very first appearance of money which became not only an important economic symbol but above all else became a measure of value and a unit of account.

Money once established as a social process and social reality had (if one could say the word) an extremely rocky and precarious history. First of all while it had a social reality but the actual social authority to use money didn’t develop a standard practice or knowledge on how to use it; it was rather undisciplined. Kings and emperors could squander large taxation revenues with impunity regardless of the consequences.They could default on repayments on loans as witnessed during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] (1627-1629).&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Kaeuper ''Bankers to the Crown: The Riccardi of Lucca and Edward I''  1973&lt;/ref&gt; Above all else kings and monarchs could take out forced loans and get others(their subjects) to pay for these forced loans and to add insult to injury get them to pay interest on the loans at extortionate rates of interest charged on the loans because they and their advisers regarded it as their own ‘income’. However, whole societies were dependent on money particularly when the whole of society had to use and be ready for its function.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls February 1255 pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls July 1255 pp. 439–440&lt;/ref&gt; Money took at least 3,000 years of history to get a more disciplined approach and became the sole prerogative of the fiscal responsibility of the state after the medieval ‘order of things’ was entirely dismantled ‘to get it right’ namely; the ruthlessness and rigorous efficiency needed for its proper function and it wasn’t until the 16th century with the advent of modern [[political economy]] with its analysis of production, [[Labour economics|labour]] and trade you then get a sense of why money, particularly its relationship with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and its complex relationship with the rest of society conversion, from labour power into money via the essential route of [[surplus value]] became a much maligned and misunderstood category and hot potato. This is where Foucault is at his most profound. Foucault now is asking how is it that modern western political economy, together with [[political philosophy]] and [[political science]] came to ask the question concerning money but was utterly perplexed by it (this is a question that particularly irritated and irked [[Karl Marx]] throughout his life)? That money and its various association with production, labour, government and trade was beyond doubt but its exact relationship with the rest of society was entirely missed by economists but yet still its version of events was entirely accepted as true? Foucault begins to try to go into the whole production of truth (both philosophical and political) its whole “breaks” “discontinuity” 'epistemological unconscious' and theoretical splitting “[[Episteme]]”. From this Greek period starting from 800 BCE Foucault pursues the path of scientific and political knowledge the emergence and conditions of possibility for philosophical knowledge and ends up with “the problem of political knowledge (i.e. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] notions of the political animal) of what is necessary in order to govern the city and put it right.” He then divided his work on the history of systems of thought into three interrelated parts, the “re-examination of knowledge, the conditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.”

==''The Punitive Society'' (1972–1973)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In these lectures, published in English in 2015, Foucault uses the first precursor of [[Discipline and Punish]] to study the foundations of what he calls “disciplinary institutions”(punitive power) and the productive dimensions of penalty. Foucault spent a lot of time during this period trying to make intelligible the internal and external dynamics of what we call the prison. He questioned, "What are the relations of power which made possible the historical emergence of something like the prison?". This was correlated to three terms; firstly ‘measure’ "a means of establishing or restoring order, the right order, in the combat of men or the elements; but also a matrix of mathematical and physical knowledge."(treated in more detail in ''The Will To Knowledge'' lectures of 1971); Secondly the ‘inquiry’ "a means of establishing or restoring facts, events, actions, properties, rights; but also a matrix of empirical knowledge and natural sciences"(from the 1972 lectures ''Theories On Punishment and Penal Theories and Institutions'') and thirdly ‘the examination’ treated as "the permanent control of the individual, like a permanent test with no endpoint". Foucault links the examination with 18th century [[Political economy]] and the productive labourers with the wealth they produce and the forces of production.

==''"Society Must Be Defended"'' (1975–1976)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This series of lectures forms a trilogy with [[Security, Territory, Population]] and [[The Birth of Biopolitics]], and it contains Foucault's first discussion of [[biopower]]. It also contains an explanation of the term "Civil war" in the form of rigorous treatment of a working definition. Foucault goes into great detail how power (as Foucault saw it) becomes a battleground drifting from civil war to generalized pacification of the individual and particularly the systems he (the individual) relies upon and to which he gives loyalty: "According to this hypothesis, the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to re-inscribe that relationship of force, and to re-inscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals." Foucault begins to explain that this generalized form of power is not only rooted in [[Disciplinary institutions]] but is also concentrated in "political sovereignty, the military, and war," so it is in turn spread evenly throughout modern society as a network of domination.

Foucault then discusses what lies behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement of history and power (bio-power). What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign is presented in the text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power ([[Disciplinary institutions]]) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘[[paradigms]],’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians Foucault argues, was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power "It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a "genealogical" mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of [[Mercantilism]], [[Statistics]] ([[mathematical statistics]]) and [[political economy]] this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called [[Nation states]] where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a "[[thanatopolitics]]"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.

This is where Foucault discusses a "counterhistory" of "race struggle or race war."According to Foucault Marx and Engels used or borrowed the term "Race" and transversed the term race into a new term called "[[Class struggle]]" which later [[Marxist]] accepted and began to use. This is more partly to do with Marx's antagonistic relationship with [[Karl Vogt]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''  Karl Marx ''Herr Vogt'' 1860&lt;/ref&gt; who for his time was a convinced [[Polygenist]] which Marx and Engels had inherited Vogt's belief. Foucault quotes letters written by Marx to Engels in 1854 and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] in 1852 {{cquote|Finally, in your place I should in general remark to the democratic gentlemen that they would do better first to acquaint themselves with bourgeois literature before they presume to yap at the opponents of it. For instance, these gentlemen should study the historical works of [[Augustin Thierry]], [[François Guizot]], [[John Wade (author)|John Wade]], and others in order to enlighten themselves as to the past 'history of classes.'Where the history of the revolutionary project and of revolutionary practice is indissoluble from this counterhistory of races&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be defended'' pp.79-80, p.85 1975-1976&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

Foucault challenges the traditional notions of racism in explaining the operation of the modern state. When Foucault talks of racism he is not talking about what we might traditionally understand it to be–an ideology, a mutual hatred. In Foucault’s reckoning modern racism is tied to power, making it something far more profound than traditionally assumed.&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;Foucault, M. (2003). Society must be defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–76, trans. David Macey. New York: Picador&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing the genealogy of racism, Foucault proposes that ‘race’, previously used to describe the division between two opposing societal groups distinguished from one another for example by religion or language, came to be conceived in the late 18th century in biological terms. The concept of "race war" that referred to conflict over the legitimacy of the power of the established sovereign, was "reformulated" into a struggle for existence driven by concern about the biopolitical purity of the population as a single race that could be threatened from within its own body. For Foucault "racism is born at the point when the theme of racial purity replaces that of race struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

For Foucault, racism "is an expression of a schism within society…provoked by the idea of an ongoing and always incomplete cleaning of the social body…it structures social fields of action, guides political practice, and is realized through state apparatuses…it is concerned with biological purity and conformity with the norm" (pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).&lt;ref name="Lemke"&gt;Lemke, T. (2011). Biopolitics. An Advanced Introduction. (Trans. E.F. Trump). New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern states, racism is not defined by the action of individuals, rather it is vested in the State and finds form in its structures and operation–it is State racism.

State racism serves two functions. Firstly, it makes it possible to divide the population into biological groups, "good and bad" or "superior or inferior" ‘races’. Fragmented into subspecies, the population can be brought under State control. Secondly, it facilitates a dynamic relationship between the life of one person and the death of another. Foucault is clear that this relationship is not one of warlike confrontation but rather a biological one, that is not based on the individual but rather on life in general "the more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I – as species rather than individual – can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be, I will be able to proliferate" (p.&amp;nbsp;255)&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

In effect race, defined in biological terms, "furnished the ideological foundation for identifying, excluding, combating, and even murdering others, all in the name of improving life not of an individual but of life in general" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="Lemke" /&gt; What is important here is that racism, inscribed as one of the modern state’s basic techniques of power, allows enemies to be treated as threats, not political adversaries. But through what mechanism are these threats treated? Here the technologies of power described by Foucault become important.

Foucault argues that new technologies of power emerged in the second half of the 18th century, which Foucault termed biopolitics and biopower(Foucault uses both terms synonymously), these technologies focused on man-as-species and were concerned with optimising the state of life, with taking control of life and intervening to "make live and let die".&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Importantly, Foucault argues, the technologies did not replace the technologies of sovereign power with their exclusive focus on disciplining the individual body to be more productive by punishing or killing individuals, but embedded themselves into them. It was in exploring how this new power, with life as its object, could come to include the power to kill that Foucault theorizes the emergence of state racism.

Foucault argues that the modern state must at some point become involved with racism in order to function since once a State functions in a biopolitical mode it is racism alone that can justify killing.&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;  Determined as a threat to the population, the State can take action to kill in the name of keeping the population safe and thriving, healthy and pure. It is racism that allows the right to kill to be squared off with a power that seeks to improve life. State racism delivers actions that while appearing to derive from altruistic intentions, veil the murder of the "Other"&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, M. (2004). Racism, Nationalism and Biopolitics: Foucault’s Society Must Be Defended, 2003. Contretemps 4, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument to its logical end, it is only when there is never a need for the State to claim the right to kill or to let die that State racism will disappear.

Since killing is predicated on racism it follows that the "most murderous states are also the most racist" (p.&amp;nbsp;258).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Foucault refers to the way in which Nazism and the state socialism of the Soviet Union dealt with ethnic or social groups and their political adversaries as examples of this.

Threats, however, can change over time and here the utility of ‘race’ a concept comes into its own. While never defining ‘race’, Foucault suggests that the word ‘race’ is "not pinned to a stable biological meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; with the implication that it is a concept that is socially and historically constructed where a discourse of truth is enabled. This makes ‘race’ something that is easy for the State to adopt and exploit for its own purpose. ‘Race’ becomes a technology that is used by the state to structure threats and to make decisions over the life and death of sub-populations. In this way it helps to explain how the idea of ‘race’ or cultural difference are used to wage wars such as the "war on terror" or the "humanitarian war" in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, E. (2015).  State Racism and the Paradox of Biopower. Foucault Studies, 0(19), 151-171. Retrieved from http://rauli.cbs.dk/index.php/foucault-studies/article/view/4828&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Security, Territory, Population'' (1977–1978)&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault  ''Lectures At The College de France Security, Territory, Population'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ==
{{Main article|Security, Territory, Population}}

The course deals with the genesis of a political knowledge that was to place at the centre of its concerns the notion of population and the mechanisms capable of ensuring its regulation but even of its procedures and means employed to ensure, in a given society, "the government of men". A transition from a "territorial state" to a "population state"([[Nation state]])?
Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] and [[biopower]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work at which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

Foucault's challenge to himself in these series of lectures is to try and decipher the genealogical split between power in ancient and [[Medieval]] society and late modern society, such as our own. By split Foucault means power as a force for manipulation of the human body. Previous notions of power failed to account for the historical subject and general shifts in techniques of power-according to Foucault's genealogy or genesis of power – it was totally denied that manipulation of the human body by unforeseen, outside forces ever existed. According to this theory, it was human ingenuity and man's ability to increase his own rationalisation was the primary motion behind social phenomena and the human subject and change was a result of increasing human reason and human conscience ingenuity. Foucault denies that any such notion had ever existed in the historical record and insists that this kind of thought is a misleading abstraction. Foucault cites the main driving force behind this set of accelerated change was the modern human sciences and the technologies both available to skilled professionals from the 16th century and a whole set of clever techniques used to shift the whole old social order into the new order of things. However, what was significant was the notion of [[Population]] practised upon the entire human species on a global mass scale, not in separately locally defined areas. By population, Foucault means its fluidness and malleability, Foucault refers to ‘a multiplicity of men, not to the extent that they are nothing more than individual bodies, but to the extent that they form, on the contrary, a global mass that is affected by overall processes of birth, death, production, taxation, illness and so forth, one should also take note that Foucault does not just mean population as singular event but a means of circulation tied to factors of security. What again was also significant was the idea of "freedom" the population's "freedom" which was the new modern [[Nation state]] and the 'neo-discourse' erected around such notions as freedom, work and [[Liberalism]], the ideological stance of the state (mass popular democracy and the voting franchise) and the state was only too willing to recognize and give freedom for example as the object of security. Population, in Foucault's understanding, is understood as a self-regulating mass;an agglomeration or circulation of people and things which co-operate and co-produce order free from heavy state regulation the state governs less allowing the population to "govern itself". For Foucault, the freedom of population is grasped at the level of how elements of population circulate. Techniques of security enact themselves through, and upon, the circulation which occurs at the level of population.In Foucault's opinion the modern concept of population, as opposed to the ancient [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and medieval version of "populousness" which has in its roots going as far back as the time period of the [[Book of Numbers]] in the [[Old testament]] [[Bible]] and the work that it sustained both in political theory and practice certainly does so; or, at least, the construction of the concept population is central to the creation of new orders of knowledge, new objects of intervention, new forms of subjectivity.

However, in order to fully understand what Foucault is trying to convey a few things should be said about the alteration techniques used that Foucault talks about in this series of lectures. The ancient and medieval version of [[Political power]] was centered around a central figure who was called a King, [[Emperor]], [[Prince]] or ruler (and in some cases the pope)of his principle territory whose rule was considered absolute ([[Absolute monarchy]]) by both [[Political philosophy]] and political theory of the day even in our time such notions still exist. Foucault uses the term population state to designate a new founded technology founded on the principal of security and territory which would mean a "population" to govern on a global mass with each population having its own territorial integrity(a separate nation) mapped out by experts in treaty negotiations&lt;ref&gt;''Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators'' Stuff 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating International Trade Treaties Before Exit'' Francis Hoar '' UK's Right to Negotiate Free Trade Agreements before leaving the European Union'' 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the new emerging field of 15th century [[Cartography|Advances in map-making technologies]] and the profession of [[Cartography]] eventually producing in the 18th century what we now know as [[nation states]]. These technologies take place at the level of "population" Foucault argues, and with the shifting aside of the body of the King or territorial ruler. By the time of the ending of the medieval period the body(or the persona of the king)of the territorial ruler became under increasingly under financial pressure and a cursory look at the medieval financial records tends to show that the monarch could not pay back all debts due to his creditors; the monarch would easily and readily default on loans due to any creditors causing financial ruin to creditors.Foucault notices that by the time of the 18th century several changes began to take place like the re-organization of armies, an emerging industrial working population begins to appear, (both military and industrial), the emergence of the [[Mathematical sciences]], [[Biological sciences]] and [[Physical sciences]] which, coincidently gave birth to a-what Foucault calls-Biopower and a political apparatus(machine) to take care of biological (in the form of medicine and health) and political life(mass democracy and the voting franchise for the population). An apparatus (both economic and political) was required much more sophisticated than previous social organisations of previous societies had at their disposal. For example, [[Bank]]s, which function as financial intermediaries and tied to the apparatus of the new 'state' machine which can easily pay back any large scale debts(large debts) which the King cannot, due to the king's own financial resources are limited;the king cannot pay back for example, the national debt, nor pay for a modern army out of his own personal resources, which can amount to trillions of US Dollars out of his own personal finances, that would be both impracticable and impossible.

== ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' (1978–1979) ==
{{Main article|The Birth of Biopolitics}}

''The Birth of Biopolitics'' develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] that Foucault introduced in his lectures on "Society must be defended". It traces how eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental rationality and raises questions of political philosophy and social policy about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics.

Over the course of many centuries the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour has received a great deal of attention. Recently(the last 60 years or so) in the academic field and journals there has been some development within the field of political and biological behaviour.In his College de France lecture course of January 1978 Foucault use the term Biopolitics(not for the first time) to denote politic power over every aspect of human life.Why did Foucault use the term Biopolitics in the first place?First of all the term Biopolitics has many different meanings to many different people and to fully understand the term as Foucault saw and used and understood it, we have to look at the very different meanings of the concept.For Foucault the term means to him the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour maximizing and increasing the human abilities machine(as we know the term).Over the course of evolutionary time this abilities machine of man becomes species specific, such as language capabilities, neuronal and cognitive capabilities so on and so forth.This then becomes over the course of the history of discursive technologies of scientific knowledge Foucault argues;became a field of knowledge established by groups of experts in the field of [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary Biology]], Physical sciences and Genetics for example.

The study of a new and rigorous discipline allied together with a new language(discourse technologies) in which a grasp of the new language is needed developing into a powerful force in the political realm as well as biological evolution the two become powerful allies (both biology and politics).Genetics and the change that develops(over time) over the course of the human organism existence.However, the two become co-joined unwittingly but one of them both political philosophy and political science have specific problems, both cannot have or lay claim to independent knowledge which is problematic for both lines of thought.Not in the case of ideology(as in Marxism) but in the case of discursive technologies.Foucault insists that the scientific knowledge being presented by historians is not an endeavour by the whole of humankind, particularly when written about by historians who claim that 'man' invented the sciences anymore than the Nazi represented the whole of humankind and the whole of humankind were to blame for the Nazi atrocities the ultimate embodiment of evil.But is, for all attempts and purposes a collaborative enterprise by groups of specially trained specialists producing a scientific community who have unfettered access to the whole of society through their scientific knowledge and expertise.

Change does indeed happen both within the organism and the organisms properties, the specific species is unable to correct them directly and biological change moves beyond any individual or single member of the species.However, these changes are aimed at the species as a whole and characteristics and traits are retained both at the biological, ecological and environmental level.In the human sciences (biology and genetics)these changes happen at a genetic and biological level which are unalterable and transpire from one generation to the next not at the individual level of the species.This is at the heart of the core theory of [[Charles Darwin]] and his proponents and the theory of [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]].Foucault's analysis try's to show that contrary to previous thought that the modern human sciences were somehow an obscure universal objective source which somehow had an absence of any linage, took over the role of the Christian church in disciplining the body by replacing the soul and confession of the Catholic church plus also the specific director of the process which in this case would be the deity(God), with indefinite supervision and discipline. However, these new techniques required a new 'director(s)' or 'editor(s)' who replaced the priestly and [[Pharaonic]] versions of much similar past vintages.These new governmental mechanism based upon the right of sovereignty and law both supported the fixed hierarchical organisation of the previous mode of feudal governmental mechanism, but stripping the modern human subject of any kind of self autonomy; not only fully fit for indoctrination, work, and education a fully fit conversant subject but left them vulnerable as well to face a permanent exam which he(the ordinary individual) had no chance in passing and was supposed to fail with no end point.Foucault maintains that these techniques were deliberate, cold, calculating and ruthless;the human sciences, far from being "a way at looking at the world" the knowledge/power dynamic/relationship [[Paradigm]] was a 'cheap' efficient and 'cost' effective method into a way of producing a subjugated and docile human subject(not only a citizen, but a political and productive citizen) as an instrument for administrative control and concern(through the state) for the well being of the population(and a constant help to the spread of Biopower)with the help of scientific classifications and new disciplinary technologies including the polity readily available to the human body and mind. Here are a few examples on what Foucault means by this type of "biopower" and bio-history of man

|[[Elizabeth Loftus]] is well known for her research in the area of memory.In this book she examines the way memories are encoded and the varies ways they can be altered.Forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the veracity of an eyewitness testimony.Loftus makes a strong argument against the eyewitness with a multitude of studies that have demonstrated the unreliability of their reports.New memories can be implanted and old memories altered with ease and this renders memories susceptible to tampering.The manner in which a question is posed can alter or implant a memory.The multiple choice style versus the open-ended style of questions are examples of this.The latter allows the witness to respond with "I don't know"whereas the former demands a response Loftus has found that people unknowingly convince themselves of an answer when forced to give an answer.With numerous real-life examples that address how we retain and retrieve memories to the differences in eyewitness ability, this book is vital to the understanding of [[Forensic psychology]].

"Yochelson and Samenow in this three volume series examine the criminal personality. The series starts at the first encounter with the offender and continues through to the process of change.It includes the issue of drug use in this population.The authors have detailed their research with what they termed "the criminal mind."Their definition of the criminal strongly resembles the description of antisocial-personality disorder and psychopathy.During the early stages of their research, Yochelson and Samenow limited their work to observation without the attempt of treatment.They detailed 52 features of criminal thinking that needed to be changed for rehabilitation to be a possibility.Patterns of deception are established early in this population and others rights are characteristically disregarded, and when arrested, this population tends to see themselves as victims and believe that they were good people despite their lengthy criminal records.Over time a treatment plan, or "process of change" was defined that change was most likely to occur in this population when the individual was vulnerable and desirous of change.The desire for change must be accompanied by an in depth knowledge of what needs to be changed.Finally, change is only possible when the long term benefits of change outweigh the benefits of maintaining a criminal lifestyle.Overall, change is considered a possibility, although not a common one.These three volumes comprise the most detailed, long-term examination of the criminal mind documented."

"Linguists have testified in legal cases implicating a wide range of linguistic levels, e.g.[[phonetics]], phonology, morphology,[[syntax]], semantics, pragmatics, and variations.Legal issues have included the following:statuary and contract language ambiguity;comprehensibility of jury instructions problems with verbatim transcripts;spoken language as evidence of intent;adequacy of warning labels on consumer products;verbal offences (libel, slander);compliance with plain language requirements;trademark and copyright infrigement;informed consent;and the regulation of advertising language by the Federal Trade Commission in the US.The best known and most experienced forensic linguist in North America is [[Roger Shuy]] whose name was for a number of years synonymous with [[Forensic linguistics]] in the case of trial consultant/expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reader's Guide To The Social  Sciences Volume 1 Edited By Jonathan Michie |last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=603–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with the most recent discovery of [[Mirror neurons]] has demonstrated Foucault has(while these techniques used in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Psychology]] are not mentioned alongside Foucault's name) hit on something that rigorous research methods may prove beyond a reasonable doubt that manipulation of social phenomena(which includes the human body and the mind) is most certainly possible.Techniques developed from the First and Second World war which started out as field experiments, among military personal, were then extended into ordinary civilian life; techniques borrowed from the Human cognitive sciences and found its way into [[Psychoanalysis|Psycho-analysis]], [[Psychiatry]], [[Psychology]], [[Clinical psychology]], [[Lightner Witmer]] and [[Clinical psychiatry]] (see this encyclopedia's article on [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]):"Mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer".He([[Ernest Dichter]]) "was the first to coin the term focus group and to stress the importance of image and persuasion in advertising".In [[Vance Packard]]'s book, [[The Hidden Persuaders]] Dichter's name is mentioned extensively.Subjectivation, a term Foucault coined for this purpose in which Biological life itself is given over to constant testing and research(an examination) without ever ending.One could argue;who are these new experts answerable too?Foucault argues that these new experts are answerable to absolutely no one.Just like previous notions of the past, absolute monarchy and divine rights of kings were answerable to nobody, their predecessors are just replacements of the past these new experts have now been democratised.Where mans body (and his soul)his mind can be manipulated and altered and is liable to be vulnerable. Every single aspect of the human subject is ripe for '[[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]]' and the technology-as it stands today-is unknown to us.This Biological ''allegory of man carries with it endless possibilities from the perspective of the [[Biological Sciences|Biological sciences]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]].The above extractions clearly show this “Biopower” of man requires man himself to administer these sophisticated technologies, where one group of experts or professionals(the enquiry) can completely subjugate another producing new human subjects(and new experts) through their expertise at manipulating social phenomena.In these few examples and according to this view:”the criminal is treated like a cancer” whereas human nature does not change which is the only society that ever gets produced, past,present or future.''

== ''On The Government Of The Living '' (1979–1980) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In the ''On The Government Of The Living'' lectures delivered in the early months of 1980, Foucault begins to ask questions of Western man obedience to power structures unreservedly and the pressing question of Government: "Government of children, government of souls and consciences, government of a household, of a state, or of oneself." Or [[governmentality]], as Foucault prefers to call it, although he fleshes out the development of that concept in his earlier lectures titled "Security, Territory, Population." Foucault tries to trace the kernel of "the genealogy of obedience" in western society. The 1980 lectures attempt to relate the historical foundations of "our obedience"—which must be understood as the obedience of the Western subject. Foucault argues confessional techniques are an innovation of the Christian West intended to guarantee men’s obedience to structures of power in return, so the belief goes, for Christian salvation.In his summary of the course Foucault asks the question: "How is it that within Western Christian culture, the government of men requires, on the part of those who are led, in addition to acts of obedience and submission, ‘acts of truth,’ which have this particular character that not only is the subject required to speak truthfully but to speak truthfully about himself?" The reader should take note here that much of this kind of work has been done before, albeit in what is best described as brilliant, lost and forgotten scholarship by such scholars as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] (his work on the [[body politic]] and the king's two bodies), [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], [[Carl Erdmann]], [[Hermann Kantorowicz]], [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederick Maitland]]. However, Foucault was after the genealogical dynamics and his main thrust was "regimes of truth" and the emergence and gradual development of "reflexive acts of truth". Foucault locates the very beginning of this act of obedience to power structures and the truth that they bring to the first Christian institutions between the 2nd century and the 5th century C.E. This is where Foucault starts to use his main tool—that is [[Genealogy (philosophy)|Genealogy]] as his main focus and it is with this genealogical tool that you finally get to understand fully what genealogy actually means. Foucault goes into great painstaking detail into the Christian [[baptism]] and its contingency and discontinuity in order to find "the genealogy of confession". This is an attempt-argues Foucault-to write a "political history of the truth".

== ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'' (1980–1981) ==
In these lectures, Foucault develops notions on the ability of the concept of truth to shift through time as described by the modern human sciences (for example [[Ethology]]) in contrast to ancient society (Aristotelian notions). It discusses how these notions are accepted as truth and produce the self as true. This is followed by a discussion on the existence of this truth and the discourse of truth for the experience of the self.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Quintscher''' (October 3, 1883 – May 8, 1945), better known under his self-assumed name '''Rah Omir''' Quintscher, was a notable [[German people|German]] member of the [[Neopagan]] religion of [[Adonism]], as well as being a noted occultist and [[ceremonial magic]]ian. In 1922 he founded a group known as the Orden Mentalistischer Bauherren (Order of the Mental Architects), which he closed down in 1928, leading its members to join another occult group, the [[Fraternitas Saturni]]. He went on join the Adonistic Society of Franz Sättler, but fell out with him, possibly over a woman, Sättler's lover and secretary, Justine Schnattinger. Leaving the Adonistic Society, Quintscher went on to further propagate Adonism through his own esoteric group, the '''Atescha-Taganosyn'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ha10|Hakl 2010]]. p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4586">'''Geolinguistics''' has been identified by some as being a branch of [[linguistics]] and by others as being an offshoot of [[language geography]] which is further defined in terms of being a branch of [[human geography]]. When seen as a branch of linguistics, geolinguistics may be viewed from more than one linguistic perspective, something with research implications.

==Conservative geolinguistic perspectives==
One academic tradition with regard to geolinguistics as a branch of linguististics gives open recognition to the role map-making can play in linguistic research by seeing the terms dialect geography,&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colfa.utsa.edu/nwav39/workshops/geolx.pdf|format=PDF|title=Workshop Proposal: Geolinguistics |website=Colfa.utsa.edu|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[language geography]]&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; and linguistic geography&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; as being synonymous with geolinguistics. This identification of geolinguistics with linguistic map-making appears across a range of languages, including Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aconf.org/conf_44779.The_Third_International_Conference_on_Chinese_Geolinguistics.html|title=The Third International Conference on Chinese Geolinguistics |website=Aconf.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French, Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.doshisha.ac.jp/~cjtl210/data1/34_oonishi.pdf|format=PDF|language={{jp icon}}|title=国立国語研究所 時空間変異研究系|website=Doshisha.ac.jp|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genhis.philol.msu.ru/article_197.shtml|title=Геолингвистика |trans-title=Geolinguistics |author=S.N. Kuznetsov |website=Genhis.philol.msu.ru|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish. In German, in addition to an identification of geolinguistics with the terms Sprachgeographie (language geography) and Dialektgeographie (dialect geography), the term Areallinguistik (area linguistics) appears as also being synonymous.

==Academic societies exhibiting conservative use of the term geolinguistics==
Two important [[geolinguistic organizations]] exist whose naming and/or translation practices imply a certain recognition of the traditional importance that dialectologists have attached to the role of language map-making as a tool for linguistic analysis. They are the ''Asian Geolinguistic Society of Japan'' and, in Europe, ''The International Society for Dialectology and Geolinguistics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geo-linguistics.org|title=SIDG|website=Geo-linguistics.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An expansive geolinguistic perspective==
A second linguistic tradition is that of [[The American Society of Geolinguistics]] which interprets geolinguistics to be "An academic discipline involving the analysis and implications of the geographical location, distribution and structure of language varieties within a temporal framework, either in isolation or in contact and/or conflict with one another, being originally conceived of by Mario Pei as being a branch of linguistics which would be used to do objective-oriented research on real life language issues and where interdisciplinary approaches would be acceptable."&lt;ref name="ASG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/geolinguistics-information/mission-statement|title=Geolinguistics Information - Mission Statement|website=American Society of Geolinguistics|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Society's mission statement mentions the gathering and disseminating of "up-to-date knowledge concerning the world`s present-day languages, dialects, and other language varieties in the context of their distribution and use, their relative practical importance, their perceived usefulness and actual availability from economic, political and cultural standpoints, their genetic, historical and geographical affiliations and relationships, and their identification and use in spoken and written form".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt; It also states the Society's interest in "linguistic geography, languages in contact and conflict, language planning and policy, language education and the broader aspects of sociolinguistics".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">The '''German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research''' (German: ''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sozialwissenschaftliche Sexualforschung'', '''DGSS''') is a [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] research and counselling organization (cf. [[sexology]]) based in [[Düsseldorf]]. It is primarily devoted to sociological, behavioral, and cultural sexuality research. It was founded in 1971 by German sexologist [[Rolf Gindorf]] and colleagues. 

The DGSS is the oldest non-medical sexological society existing in German-language [[Europe]] (i. e., [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], and parts of [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]). Its governing and international advisory boards have included many noted scholars, among them Rüdiger Lautmann, [[John Money]], [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], John Gagnon, [[Igor Kon|Igor S. Kon]] [http://www.neuro.net.ru/sexology/english/], [[Liu Dalin]], and Martin S. Weinberg [http://www.indiana.edu/~soc/zbio_Weinberg.shtml]. Presidents were [[Rolf Gindorf]] (1971-1979, Vice Pres. -2004, now Hon. Pres.), Helmut Kentler (1979-1982), [[Ernest Borneman]] (1982-1986, now Hon. Pres.), [[Erwin J. Haeberle]] (1986-2002), Gunter Runkel (2002-2006) [http://www.sexologie.org/runkel.htm], and [[Jakob Pastoetter]] [http://www.sexologie.org/topf/jmp.htm] (2006-).
 
From the very beginning, the DGSS has emphasized the importance of the social, behavioral, and cultural sciences for an adequate understanding of the human sexualities in their many forms, facets, and variations. In addition to traditional sexological fields like [[biology]], [[physiology]], and [[medicine]], the DGSS focus has centered on the [[social sciences]], [[psychology]], and [[ethnology]], embracing also educational, legal, and historical aspects. In 1978, the DGSS added a pioneering [[psychotherapy|counselling]] institute ("DGSS-Institut") to its scientific and research activities. Since then, more than 33,000 clients received sexual counselling or [[psychotherapy]]. [[Gay]], [[lesbian]] and [[bisexual]] people form a considerable group. [[AIDS]] counseling and [[HIV]] antibody testing has been provided since 1983.
 
Under difficult circumstances, with habitually low financial resources and extremely modest outside support, the DGSS has nevertheless managed to hold increasingly successful national and international sexological congresses, establishing a close cooperation with most German and many foreign sexological societies. An impressive number of scientific publications, including many books and a book series ("Schriftenreihe Sozialwissenschaftliche Sexualforschung", Berlin/New York: W. de Gruyter, since 1986; Münster/Hamburg/London: LIT Verlag, since 2003) give a fairly adequate impression of sexological research by the DGSS and its members. 

Since 1990, the DGSS has been awarding its [[Magnus Hirschfeld Medal]]s for [[Sexual Science]] and for [[Sexual Reform]]. Recipients so far were [[Ernest Borneman]] (Austria), [[John P. DeCecco]] (U.S.A.), [[Liu Dalin]] (China), [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] (U.S.A), [[Milton Diamond]] (U.S.A), [[John Money]] (U.S.A), [[Martin S. Weinberg]] (U.S.A.), [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Richard Green]] (U.S.A/UK) and [[Hu Peicheng]] (China) for Sexual Science ([[Sexology]]); [[Herman Musaph]] (The Netherlands), [[Imre Aszódi]] (Hungary), [[Ruth Westheimer]] (U.S.A.), [[Maj-Briht Bergström-Walan]] (Sweden), [[Oswalt Kolle]] (The Netherlands), [[Manfred Bruns]] (Germany), [[William Granzig]] (U.S.A), [[Rolf Gindorf]], [[Rita Süssmuth]] (Germany) and [[Robert T. Francoeur]] (U.S.A.) for [[Sexual Reform]].
 
Once the Berlin wall had fallen, the DGSS was able to move its congresses to the original birthplace of sexology, and to resume the tradition of the Berlin sexological conferences started in 1921 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. From July 25–27, 1997, the XIII. DGSS Congress of Social Scientific Sex Research, being at the same time the VI. International Berlin Conference for Sexology), took place at Berlin's old [[Humboldt University]]. Its theme: "100 Years of [[Gay Liberation]]". Scientists (most of them gay) came from many countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. From June 29 through July 2, 2000, the XIV. DGSS Congress was held in conjunction with the V. Conference of the [[European Federation of Sexology]] (EFS) in Berlin's "House of World Cultures", hosting some 270 delegates from 34 countries. Its theme: "For A Millennium of Sexual Health". In 2002, the XVth DGSS Conference from June 21–23 was moved, following the DGSS  president-elect Gunter Runkel, to the romantic, historic town of [[Lüneburg]] (near [[Hamburg]]) and its modern university. Its general theme: "Sexualities in the Third Millennium - Recent Developments in Sexuality Research". Again, sexologists from many nations attended, colleagues from the United States forming the largest contingent. In 2004, the XVI. DGSS Conference on "Sexualities and Social Change" was likewise held in Lüneburg, where the XVII. Conference ("Sexuality and Love") also took place on Sept. 22-24, 2006. The XVIIIth DGSS Conference ("Sexuality and the Media") will take place in Munich from Nov. 7-9, 2008, again with many Americans scheduled to attend.

==History==
Graceland University was established as Graceland College in 1895 by the RLDS Church in Lamoni, Iowa. Land for the college was donated by church members, with the first 20 acres given by [[Marietta Walker]]. The name "Graceland" was selected by Col. George Barrett, land surveyor for the college, for the graceful slope of the hill upon which the college was built. Until the administration building was completed, classes were conducted in a building in downtown Lamoni. The first day of classes was September 17, 1895. 

In 1917, Graceland received accreditation from the states of Iowa and Missouri and from the North Central Association of Colleges, making it the first fully accredited junior college in Iowa. Graceland became a four-year college in 1960. Graceland's nursing program began in 1910 as a cooperative program with the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital, Independence, MO. The Graceland campus was extended to Independence with the establishment of the college's bachelor's degree program in 1968-69.

The Graceland Partnership Program, offering degree-completion programs on community college campuses, was established in 1989. In 1995, Graceland acquired SkillPath, a business training company that offers seminars and classes. Graceland College became Graceland University on June 1, 2000.

==Chapel==
[[File:Cheville Chapel300.jpg|right|framed|Roy A. Cheville Chapel at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, dedicated 1978]]The Cheville Chapel was dedicated in 1978 in honor of [[Roy Cheville]], theologian, educator and former [[Presiding Patriarch (Mormonism)|Presiding Patriarch]] of the [[Community of Christ]]. The structure was built for $325,000 and was funded by a restricted private bequest. In keeping with the desire for the [[chapel]] to be an accessible place of solitude, Graceland's president Frank Hough determined that the facility should remain unstaffed and open at all times.

The Chapel's relatively small [[seating capacity]] makes it an intimate setting for worship, theological education and the performance of [[sacred music]]. Known for its excellent [[acoustics]], it has been used for small ensemble performances. It is used several times a week by campus groups for [[worship]] services, and as a place of individual [[prayer]] and reflection. 

Architecturally, the [[postmodern]] brick structure is [[minimalist]] in its design. It is reminiscent of the exterior simplicity of the [[Rothko Chapel]] in Houston built only a few years earlier, while its twin [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] foreshadows the [[deconstructivism]] style in architecture that began a decade later. The chapel houses Aaron Sherer's "The Process of Becoming," a canvas wall hanging employing a mix of colorfully painted ribbons.

==Student life==
=== Residence life ===
Instead of having fraternities and sororities like many universities, Graceland has residential social organizations called "Houses." These Houses are present on Graceland’s main campus; however, the Independence campus does have its own House, McKevit Manor. Students are assigned to a House regardless whether they live on or off campus. Graceland has six men’s Houses: Agape, Cheville, Closson, Faunce, Orion, and Stewart Manor. Graceland has nine female Houses: Amici, Aponivi, Dimora, Hanthorne, Khiyah, Paloma, Sariah, Shalom, and Solah.&lt;ref name=Lead&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20&amp;%20Service/index Campus Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126010217/http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Leadership%20%26%20Service/index |date=2012-11-26 }} "Leadership &amp; Service." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House has officers who serve on Graceland’s Student Government. The officers form a “House Council,” including a House President (who leads the House Council), a Campus Organization of Social Activities (COSA) representative, an Academic Student Council (ASC) representative, a senator, an intramural sports representative and a chaplain. Members of the House Council are elected to their positions by members of their House. In addition to their Student Government duties, House Council members plan social activities called “functions.” These functions vary by House and range from formal dinners to campouts.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

Houses hold meetings every Tuesday at 10 p.m. Meetings are led by the House President and House Council and vary widely from House to House.&lt;ref name=Lead/&gt;

=== Activities and organizations ===
Graceland has over 50 clubs and organizations for students. Between Graceland Student Government and the campus clubs and organizations, over 250 official leadership positions are available.&lt;ref name=Orgs&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index Activities and Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115174941/http://graceland.edu/Campus-Life/Get-Involved/index |date=2013-01-15 }} "Get Involved." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graceland Student Government is a popular student activity, particularly for sophomore and junior students on campus.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Intramurals is perhaps the campus’ most popular activity, with over 98 percent student participation. Intramural teams are divided by House and level of competition.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

Other popular student clubs include the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Club, Outreach International club, Enactus, Art Student Society and Sustainability Club.&lt;ref name=Orgs/&gt;

=== Performing arts ===
With the completion of the Shaw Center expansion in fall 2012, Graceland has placed a renewed emphasis on the performing arts. Graceland performance groups include Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Oratorio Chorus, Jazz Band, Pep Band, Symphonic Band, Orchestra and Theatre. For the 2012-2013 academic year, Graceland doubled its number of annual theatre productions. Over 1/3 of Graceland student participate in the arts (both visual and performing).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index Performing Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065614/http://www.graceland.edu/Academics/College-and-Schools/College-of-Liberal-Arts-and-Sciences/Division-of-Visual--Performing-Arts/index |date=2012-01-07 }} "Come express yourself at Graceland University." Graceland University. N.p., n.d. Web. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graceland brings a variety of talent acts to campus. In 2012, Graceland has brought in Canadian trumpeter Jens Lindemann, trombone player Wycliffe Gordon, the Fountain City Brass Band, vocalist Shannon Gaye, and actor Arliss Howard who directed Graceland’s Homecoming play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graceland.edu/pdf/alumni/horizons/2012FallHorizons.pdf 2012 Fall Homecoming Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315060220/http://www.graceland.edu/pdf/alumni/horizons/2012FallHorizons.pdf |date=2013-03-15 }} Meline, Randy.

=== School traditions ===
'''House Meeting'''

Every Tuesday at 10:00 p.m. student gather with their fellow House members in a weekly meeting. Meetings are led by the House President and involve House Council members. Meetings vary from House to House, but generally include recreational activities and announcements from House Council members. Meetings are generally held in House lounges.&lt;ref name=David&gt;Goehner, David. The Graceland College Book of Knowledge. Independence: Herald Publishing House, 1997. 168-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airband'''

Every year at Graceland’s annual Homecoming weekend, COSA puts on an annual Airband competition. Male Houses are paired with female Houses (brother/sister Houses) and the teams compete against each other in a choreographed dance competition. Houses spend weeks preparing props, themes, and storylines for the competition; then perform their routine before a panel of judges. The winner of Airband is awarded points, and the team with the most Homecoming points wins money for their House.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''New Years in November'''

Every year in mid-November, COSA sponsors a campuswide dance and celebration, called New Year’s in November. The event is essentially a celebration of the coming new year, because students are not on campus for New Year’s Eve. The event has a specific theme every year and includes dancing and other activities. The event traditionally ends with a pancake breakfast in the Commons.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Final Fling'''

The final weekend of the semester, COSA sponsors a campuswide celebration for students. Events vary year to year, but often include inflatables, sports tournaments, and various entertainment acts. Students collect wristbands for each event they attend, and at the weekend’s conclusion enter their wristbands in a drawing for prizes.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

'''Thursday Night Movie'''

Once a week, COSA plays a free movie in the local theatre, The Coliseum. Before 2012, the movie played on Wednesdays; however the day was changed in fall 2012 to accommodate Graceland Student Government meetings.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;

==Athletics==

[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Hjulström curve]]The '''Hjulström curve''', named after [[Filip Hjulström]] (1902–1982), is a [[graph of a function|graph]] used by [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] and geologists to determine whether a [[river]] will [[erosion|erode]], [[sediment transport|transport]], or [[deposition (geology)|deposit]] sediment. It was originally published in his doctoral thesis "Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River [[Fyris]].&lt;ref&gt;Hjulstrom, F. (1935). Studies of the morphological activity of rivers as illustrated by the River Fyris, Bulletin. Geological Institute Upsalsa, 25, 221-527.&lt;/ref&gt;" in 1935. The graph takes sediment particle size and water velocity into account.&lt;ref name=geography&gt;[http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html Sediment transportation]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211142423/http://www.geographylwc.org.uk/A/AS/ASriver/seddep.html |date=2011-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The upper curve shows the critical erosion velocity in cm/s as a function of particle size in mm, while the lower curve shows the deposition velocity as a function of particle size. Note that the axes are [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. 

The plot shows several key concepts about the relationships between erosion, transportation, and deposition. For particle sizes where friction is the dominating force preventing erosion, the curves follow each other closely and the required velocity increases with particle size. However, for [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] sediment, mostly [[clay]] but also [[silt]], the ''erosion'' velocity increases with decreasing [[grain size]], as the cohesive forces are relatively more important when the particles get smaller. The critical velocity for deposition, on the other hand, depends on the [[settling velocity]], and that decreases with decreasing grainsize. The Hjulström curve shows that sand particles of a size around 0.1 mm require the lowest stream velocity to erode.

The curve was expanded by [[Åke Sundborg]] in 1956. He significantly improved the level of detail in the cohesive part of the diagram, and added lines for different modes of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/hydr/concepts/gwater/hjulstrm.htm Hjulström's Diagram]. [[Idaho State University]]. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is called the ''Sundborg diagram'', or the ''Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram'', in the academic literature.

This curve dates back to early 20th century research on river geomorphology and has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless [[Shields Diagram]] is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers. Much work was done on river sediment transport formulae in the second half of the 20th century and that work should be used preferably to Hjulström's curve.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are [[food security|food insecure]], India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the [[Global Hunger Index]] 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an “serious“ (31.4) [[food security]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of [[underweight]] children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. 

While there has been attention to hunger and [[undernourishment]] at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the  federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts.

==Indicators and underlying data==

The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and [[malnutrition]]. It combines three equally weighted indicators:

# the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake);
# the prevalence of [[underweight]] children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and 
# the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments).

The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005–2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child [[underweight]] and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.

== Key findings ==

*ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (“serious”) for [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to 30.9 (“extremely alarming”) for [[Madhya Pradesh]], indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished.
*All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the “low” and “moderate” hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the “alarming” category, and one into the “extremely alarming” category.
*ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective.
*Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

The '''Program in Creative Writing''', more commonly known as the '''Iowa Writers' Workshop''', at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], is a celebrated&lt;ref name="Where Great Writers are Made"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200708/edward-delaney-mfa| title=Where Great Writers are Made |author=Edward J. Delaney | date=August 2007| work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduate-level [[creative writing]] program in the [[United States]]. Writer [[Lan Samantha Chang]] is its director. Graduates earn a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree in Creative Writing. It has been cited as the best graduate writing program in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebestschools.org/features/top-creative-writing-programs/|title=The 10 Best Creative Writing Programs {{!}} The Best Schools|work=The Best Schools|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
The program began in 1936 with the gathering of poets and fiction writers under the direction of [[Wilbur Schramm]].

The workshop's second director from 1941–1965 was [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], native [[Paul Engle]]. Under his tenure, the Writers' Workshop became a national landmark. He successfully secured donations for the workshop from the business community for about 20 years, including locals such as [[Maytag]] and [[Quaker Oats]], as well as [[U.S. Steel]] and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name= Bennett&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Eric|title=How Iowa Flattened Literature|url=http://chronicle.com/article/How-Iowa-Flattened-Literature/144531/|work=MFA vs. NYC: The Two Cultures of American Fiction|publisher=Faber  and Faber and n+1|accessdate=2 April 2014|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1953 and 1956, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] donated $40,000. [[Henry Luce]], the publisher of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazines, and [[Gardner Cowles, Jr.]] (1903–1985), who published ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, provided publicity for the workshop's events.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

From 1965–1969, the workshop had several different directors.{{who|date=January 2015}}
[[John Leggett]] was the director from 1969–86 and attracted writers such as [[T.C. Boyle]], [[Ethan Canin]], [[Michael Cunningham]], [[Gail Godwin]], [[Denis Johnson]], and [[Jane Smiley]].&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite news|author1=John McMurtrie|title=John Leggett, former director of Iowa Writers' Workshop, dies at 97|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/bookmarks/2015/01/26/john-leggett-former-director-of-iowa-writers-workshop-dies-at-97/|accessdate=31 January 2015|work=SF Chronicle|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 until his death in 2005, [[Frank Conroy]] directed the workshop and was Engle's longest-lasting successor. [[Lan Samantha Chang]] became the director in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/about/about-workshop/history|title=Iowa Writer's Workshop History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The '''Program in Creative Writing''', at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], is more commonly known as the '''Iowa Writers' Workshop'''&lt;ref name="Where Great Writers are Made" /&gt; graduate-level [[creative writing]] program in the [[United States]].

Graduates earn a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree in English. Iowa has the oldest creative writing program in the country offering an MFA credential.&lt;ref name=nyt86&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/magazine/can-writing-be-taught-in-iowa.html | title=Can Writing Be Taught in Iowa? |author=Maureen Howard | date=May 25, 1986| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty and alumni ===
{{Main|List of Iowa Writers' Workshop people}}
The workshop is staffed by three permanent{{Who|date=February 2016}} and several visiting faculty.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Curriculum and courses ===
The program's curriculum requires students to take a small number of classes each semester, including the Graduate Fiction Workshop or Graduate Poetry Workshop itself, and one or two additional literature seminars. The modest requirements are intended to prepare the student for the realities of professional writing, where self-discipline is paramount. The graduate workshop courses meet weekly.  Before each three-hour class, a small number of students submit material for critical reading by their peers.  The class itself consists of a round-table discussion during which the students and the instructor discuss each piece. The specifics of how the class is conducted vary somewhat from teacher to teacher, and between poetry and fiction workshops. The ideal result is not only that authors come away with insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their own work, but that the class as a whole derives some insight, whether general or specific, about the process of writing.&lt;ref name=nyt86 /&gt;

=== Podcast ===
"Conversations from the Iowa Writer's Workshop" is an event put on by the program that is recorded and put online in podcast form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.writinguniversity.org/podcast|title=Writing University Podcast - The Writing University|author=|date=|website=www.writinguniversity.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulitzer Prizes won by graduates and faculty ==
{{as of|2018}}, Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni won 17 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, as well as numerous [[National Book Award]]s and other literary honors. Six [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|U.S. Poets Laureate]] have been graduates of the workshop.{{when|date=May 2015}}
Faculty and graduates affiliated with the Iowa Writers' Workshop have won 29 [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, including 16 won by graduates since 1947, and graduates and faculty of the [[The University of Iowa|University of Iowa]] have won over 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/admissions/undergrad/after-grad/pulitzers.html |title=Pulitzer Prizes Awarded to UI Faculty Members or Alumni |website=University of Iowa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727081143/http://www.uiowa.edu/admissions/undergrad/after-grad/pulitzers.html |archivedate=2005-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jus commune''''' or '''''ius commune''''' is [[Latin]] for "common law" in certain jurisdictions. It is often used by [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurist]]s to refer to those aspects of the civil law system's invariant legal principles, sometimes called "the law of the land" in [[English law]]. While the ''ius commune'' was a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'', p. 20 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ius commune'' is distinct from the term "[[common law]]" meaning the Anglo-American family of law as opposed to the civil law family.)

The phrase "the common law of the civil law systems" means those underlying laws that create a distinct legal system and are common to all its elements.

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'', in its historical meaning, is commonly thought of as a combination of [[canon law]] and [[Roman law]] which formed the basis of a common system of legal thought in Western Europe from the rediscovery and reception of [[Justinian's Digest]] in the 12th and 13th centuries.  In addition to this definition, the term also possibly had a narrower meaning depending upon the context in which it was used.  Some scholars believe that the term, when used in the context of the ecclesiastical courts of England in the fourteenth and fifteenth century, also "meant the law that is common to the universal church, as opposed to the constitutions or special customs or privileges of any provincial church."&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Maitland, ''Canon Law in England'', The English Historical Review, Vol. 11, No. 43 (Jul. 1896) pp. 446-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was an actual part of the law in most areas, although in any one jurisdiction local laws (statutes and customs) could take precedence over the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}''. This was the case up until the [[Codification (law)|codification]] movement in the late 18th and 19th centuries, which explicitly removed the direct applicability of Roman and canon law in most countries, although there continued to be argument about whether the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' was banished completely or survived where the national codes were silent.

The latter view prevailed, so it can still be said that there is, in theory at least, a common basis in substantive law throughout Western Europe (except England, which never had a reception as such) although it has of course fragmented greatly from its heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries. More important, however, is the civilian tradition of ways of thinking that the ''{{lang|la|ius commune}}'' encouraged and the procedures it used, which have been more persistent than the actual substance.

In England, the law developed its own tradition separate from the rest of Europe based on its own common law. [[Scotland]] has a mixed civil and common law system. Scotland had a reception of Roman law and partial codification through the works of the Institutional Writers, such as [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|Viscount Stair]] and [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Baron Hume]], among others. Influence from England has meant that Scotland's current system is more common law than civilian, but there are areas which are still heavily based on Roman law, such as Scots property law.
 &lt;!-- adding more information about the history of the development of a common law in civil law systems. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23583">'''Latin American studies''' ('''LAS''') is an academic and [[research]] field associated with the study of [[Latin America]]. The [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study is a subfield of [[area studies]], and can be composed of numerous disciplines such as [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[History|history,]] [[International relations|international relations,]] [[political science]], [[geography]], [[gender studies]], and [[Literature|literature.]] 

==Definition==
Latin American studies critically examines the [[history]], [[culture]], [[international relations]], and [[politics]], of [[Latin America]]. It is not to be confused with [[Latino studies|Latino Studies]], an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic ancestry]] in the United States.

Latin Americanists consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse research tools in their work. The interdisciplinary disciplines of study varies, depending on the school, association, and academic program. For example, the Latin American Centre of the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS) at the [[University of Oxford]] heavily focuses on the social sciences, such as the economics, politics, and development of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lac.ox.ac.uk/msc-latin-american-studies-msc-las|title=MSc Latin American Studies (MSc LAS) {{!}} Latin American Centre|website=www.lac.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, schools like Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS) at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]], focus on the humanities; with the language, culture, and history of Latin America as a central component&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/llilas/student-programs/graduate-program/overview.php|title=UT College of Liberal Arts:|website=liberalarts.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others include the study of [[Environmental studies|environment]] and [[ecology]] of the region.

Latin American studies is usually quite open and often includes or is closely associated with, for instance, [[Development studies]], [[Geography]], [[Anthropology]], [[Caribbean]] studies, and [[Transatlantic studies]].

==History==
Latin America has been studied in one way or another ever since Columbus's voyage of 1492.  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientist explorers such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] published extensively about the region.  Towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the turn of the twentieth, within the region itself writers such as [[José Martí]] and [[José Enrique Rodó]] encouraged a consciousness of regional identity.

In 1875, the [[International Congress of Americanists]] held its first meeting in Nancy, France, and has met regularly ever since, alternating between venues in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. However, unlike the scholarly organizations of the twentieth century, the ICA does not have an ongoing organization, nor is there a journal of the ICA. The creation of formal and ongoing scholarly organizations focusing on Latin America is a product of the twentieth century.

In the US, historians with an interest in [[Latin American history]] within the [[American Historical Association]] created a group focusing on Latin America. In 1918, they founded ''[[The Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', which has published quarterly since that time and has built a reputation as one of the premier scholarly journals.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://hahr.dukejournals.org/ homepage ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin Americanists within the AHA created the [[Conference on Latin American History]] in 1926, which is now separately incorporated (since 1964), but continues to coordinate its annual meetings with the American Historical Association.  In 1936, US Latin Americanists also founded the ''[[Handbook of Latin American Studies]],'' with editorial offices in the Hispanic Division of the [[Library of Congress]]. In a pre-digital era, the compilation of annotated bibliographic references in the humanities and social science organized by subject and country was a vital tool for scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix," ''[[Latin American Research Review]]'', Vol 2 No. 1, (Autumn, 1966) pp. 57-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division-and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic-collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, the US government began seriously focusing on Latin America as [[Cuba]] and the hemisphere was seen to be an integral element of [[Cold War]] politics.  The Latin American historian who wrote the early history of the founding of the [[Latin American Studies Association]] wryly suggested in 1966 that at some future date Latin Americanists should erect a statue to [[Fidel Castro]], the "remote godfather" of the field, who instigated a renewed US interest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix," ''Latin American Research Review'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn 1966), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in Latin American studies increased starting in the 1950s. In the US, Latin American studies (like other [[area studies]]) was boosted by the passing of Title VI of the [[National Defense Education Act]] (NDEA) of 1958, which provided resources for Centers of Area and International Studies.[http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/iegps/history.html]  In the UK, the 1965 "Parry Report"{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} provided similar impetus for the establishment of Institutes and Centres of Latin American Studies at Oxford, London, Cambridge, and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya,ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, [[York University]] in Toronto established the first Latin American center, "in part thanks to the inflow of exiled intellectuals from South America."&lt;ref&gt;Moya, ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut]] in Berlin had been founded in 1930, but not until the 1970s did it experience expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfRA)''' (German: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie'') is located in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (German: Max-Planck-Gesellschaft). {{coord|50|43|47.6|N|7|4|9.2|E|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Argelander-Institute for Astronomy}}

== History ==
By combining the already existing [[radio astronomy]] faculty of the [[University of Bonn]] led by [[Otto Hachenberg]] with the new Max Planck institute the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy was formed. In 1972 the 100-m [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope|radio telescope in Effelsberg]] was opened. The institute building was enlarged in 1983 and 2002.

[[File:The Stars Streak Overhead.jpg|thumb|The [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] is a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, the Onsala Space Observatory and [[ESO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Stars Streak Overhead|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1250a/|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The southern wing of the whole complex is occupied by the Argelander Institute of Astronomy of the University of Bonn.

== Structure ==
The Institute has three main research groups, each with its own Director - Fundamental Physics (director Michael Kramer), VLBI (director Anton Zensus) and Millimetre Astronomy (director Karl Menten).

== Graduate Program ==
The International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Astronomy and Astrophysics is a highly competitive-entry graduate program offering a Ph.D. The school is run in cooperation with the [[University of Bonn]] and [[University of Cologne]].

The initiative for the establishment of the Military Physics Institute was taken in 1939 when the leaders of the country's physical institutions joined forces to make more effective use of the physical research results for military purposes.&lt;ref name="National Archives of Sweden"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/nad?postid=ArkisRef+SE%2FKrA%2F0520 |publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]] |title=Försvarsmedicinska forskningsdelegationen / Militärfysiska institutet &gt; Förteckning |trans-title=Defense Medical Research Delegation / Military Physics Institute &gt; List |access-date=30 January 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Physics Institute was established in 1940 by the Swedish National Committee for Physics (''Svenska nationalkommitten för fysik'') and the year after state funding for the operation was applied. Research within the Military Physics Institute focused on the development of new weapons of defense. These include surveys of the military use of [[Infrared|infrared radiation]] as well as the problems of [[shaped charge]].&lt;ref name="National Archives of Sweden"/&gt; An area in [[Södertörn]] near [[Grindsjön]] was donated by Olof Arrhenius, at which the institute built a test station for the operations. The Military Physics Institute was amalgamated into department 2 in connection with the formation of the [[Swedish National Defence Research Institute]] on 1 July 1945.&lt;ref name="National Archives of Sweden"/&gt;

The '''National Ignition Facility''' ('''NIF'''), is a large [[laser]]-based [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research device, located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]]. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ "About NIF &amp; Photon Science"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/world-most-powerful-laser-120322.htm|title=RebelMouse vs. WordPress VIP|author=|date=10 May 2017|website=discovery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted. Construction was certified complete on 31 March 2009 by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]],&lt;ref name="Certified complete"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Energy Announces Completion of World's Largest Laser |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401194726/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a dedication ceremony took place on 29 May 2009.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dedication of world's largest laser marks the dawn of a new era | url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] | date=2009-05-29 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527184853/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | archivedate=2010-05-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009&lt;ref name="firstshots"&gt;{{cite web | title=First NIF Shots Fired to Hohlraum Targets | url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | publisher=National Ignition Facility | date=June 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528000229/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | archivedate=2010-05-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first "integrated ignition experiments" (which tested the laser's power) were declared completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Oct8_10"&gt;{{cite web | title = First successful integrated experiment at National Ignition Facility announced | work = General Physics | publisher = PhysOrg.com | date = October 8, 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news205740709.html | accessdate = 2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing the system to its full potential was a lengthy process that was carried out from 2009 to 2012. During this period a number of experiments were worked into the process under the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition just after the laser reached full power, some time in the second half of 2012. The Campaign officially ended in September 2012, at about {{frac|10}} the conditions needed for ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Crandall |first=David |title=Final Review of the National Ignition Campaign |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_rev6_Koonin_2012.pdf |date=27 December 2010 |publisher=Department of Energy |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments since then have pushed this closer to {{frac|3}}, but considerable theoretical and practical work is required if the system is ever to reach ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Assessment of the Prospects for Inertial Fusion Energy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBKfAwAAQBAJ |publisher= National Academies Press |date=July 2013 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, NIF has been used primarily for materials science and weapons research.

==Description==

===ICF basics===
{{Main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use ''drivers'' to rapidly heat the outer layers of a ''target'' in order to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.&lt;ref name=how&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ "How NIF works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on October 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which, primarily [[alpha particle]]s, collide with the surrounding high density fuel and heat it further. If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.&lt;ref name=hurricane&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as ''ignition'', which will lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and releasing large amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|title=Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221233137/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|archivedate=2008-12-21 |last=Peterson|first=Per F.|date=1998-09-23|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the target. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F.

===Driver laser===
NIF aims to create a single 500&amp;nbsp;[[watt|terawatt]] (TW) peak flash of light that reaches the target from numerous directions at the same time, within a few [[1 E-12 s|picoseconds]]. The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: NNSA and LLNL announce first successful integrated experiment at NIF|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-and-llnl-announce-first-successful-integrated-experiment-nif|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=6 October 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical fiber laser known as the Master Oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146–155&lt;/ref&gt;  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&amp;nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

[[Image:NIF beamline diagram.png|thumb|left|400px|Simplified diagram of the beampath of a NIF laser beam, one of 192 similar beamlines. On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]

The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&amp;nbsp;MJ (117&amp;nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&amp;nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&amp;nbsp;TW.

Near the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.

The total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Doug W. (2004).

Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''. The target chamber is a {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-diameter}} multi-piece steel sphere weighing {{convert|130000|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792/ |title=Could This Lump Power the Planet? |author=Lyons, Daniel |date=2009-11-14 |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |page=3 |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117020847/http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792 |archivedate=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the ''switchyard'' and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Arnie Heller, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug05/VanArsdall.html Orchestrating the World's Most Powerful Laser]'', Science &amp; Technology Review, July/August 2005. Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and switchyard system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber.

[[Image:NIF building layout.png|thumb|right|400px|NIF's basic layout. The laser pulse is generated in the room just right of center, and is sent into the beamlines (blue) on either side. After several passes through the beamlines the light is sent into the "switchyard" (red) where it is aimed into the target chamber (silver).]]

One of the last steps in the process before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053&amp;nbsp;nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351&amp;nbsp;nm in a device known as a [[optical frequency multiplier|frequency converter]].&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180–189.&lt;/ref&gt; These are made of thin sheets (about 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&amp;nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&amp;nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&amp;nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&amp;nbsp;nm light into 351&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Bibeau, Camille; Paul J. Wegner, Ruth Hawley-Fedder (June 1, 2006).

One important aspect of any ICF research project is ensuring that experiments can actually be carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day. One of the goals for NIF is to reduce this time to less than four hours, in order to allow 700 firings a year.&lt;ref name=performance&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html NIF Project Sets Record for Laser Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528023239/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html |date=2010-05-28 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, June 5, 2003.

===NIF and ICF===
[[Image:Laser hohlraum target energy coupling.svg|thumb|left|300px|[[Sankey diagram]] of the laser energy to [[hohlraum]] [[x-ray]] to target capsule energy coupling efficiency. Note the "laser energy" is after conversion to [[UV]], which loses about 50% of the original [[infrared|IR]] power.]]

The name National Ignition Facility refers to the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought threshold in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

NIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Lindl et al., ''[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000011000002000339000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes The physics basis for ignition using indirect-drive targets on the National Ignition Facility]'', Physics of Plasmas, Vol. 11, February 2004, page 339. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the NIF, the large delivered power allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (−255&amp;nbsp;°C) and lined with a layer of frozen DT fuel. The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas.

In a typical experiment, the laser will generate 3&amp;nbsp;MJ of infrared laser energy of a possible 4. About 1.5&amp;nbsp;MJ of this is left after conversion to UV, and about 15 percent of this is lost in the x-ray conversion in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150&amp;nbsp;kJ, will be absorbed by the outer layers of the target.&lt;ref name=gain&gt;Suter, L.; J. Rothenberg, D.

The pressure is the equivalent of 300 billion atmospheres.&lt;ref name=hurricane/&gt;

It is expected this will cause about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion energy to be released, resulting in a net fusion energy gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV laser energy).&lt;ref name=gain/&gt; Improvements in both the laser system and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420&amp;nbsp;kJ, which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion energy.&lt;ref name=density/&gt; However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion energy release, due to the design of the target chamber.&lt;ref name=target&gt;M.

These output energies are still less than the 422&amp;nbsp;MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least an order of magnitude more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient [[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|diode-pumped solid state lasers]], where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephen |last1=Paine |first2=Christopher |last2=Marshall |url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Payne.html |title=Taking Lasers Beyond the NIF |journal=Science and Technology Review |date=September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other concepts===
NIF is also exploring new types of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic [[laser ablation|ablators]], typically [[polystyrene]] (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form with a layer of sputtered [[beryllium]] or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Wilson et all, ''[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000005000005001953000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes The development and advantages of beryllium capsules for the National Ignition Facility]'', Phys.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the incoming energy is in the form of x-rays.

Although NIF was primarily designed as an indirect drive device, the energy in the laser is high enough to be used as a ''direct drive'' system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in [[Fusion energy gain factor|fusion energy gains]] of about 40 times,&lt;ref&gt;S.

A more uniform beam layout suitable for direct drive experiments can be arranged through changes in the switchyard that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber.

It has been shown, using scaled implosions on the OMEGA laser and computer simulations, that NIF should also be capable of igniting a capsule using the so-called ''polar direct drive'' (PDD) configuration where the target is irradiated directly by the laser, but only from the top and bottom, with no changes to the NIF beamline layout.&lt;ref name=pdd&gt;Yaakobi, B.; R.

Other targets, called ''saturn targets'', are specifically designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion.&lt;ref&gt;True, M. A.; J. R. Albritton, and E. A.

==History==

===Impetus===
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]'s (LLNL) history with the ICF program starts with physicist [[John Nuckolls]], who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear weapons arranged by [[Edward Teller]] at LLNL. During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large underground caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt;

There are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based atomic bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a D-T "spark plug" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, essentially making the spark plug the entire secondary. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls&gt;John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf "Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)"], LLNL, 12 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&amp;nbsp;MJ beam.&lt;ref name="EarlyNuckolls"/&gt; To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&amp;nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html "Convert kilotons, to megajoules"], Unit Juggler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994.

===ICF program begins===
While Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt; LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).

Throughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.

Further upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&amp;nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&amp;nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.&lt;ref name=peer&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&amp;nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.

===Halite and Centurion===
With each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.

Each test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.&lt;ref name=secretadvance&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, "A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the tests suggested that about 10&amp;nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 "Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path"], Free Online Library, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf "Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt "Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995&lt;/ref&gt; If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;

A great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result. One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&amp;nbsp;MJ limit. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations based on these experiments that suggested that careful shaping of the laser pulse and using more beams spread more evenly showed that ignition and net energy gains could be achieved with a laser between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6686429-47queD/6686429.pdf|title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=osti.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Development of the Indirect-Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain, Physics of Plasmas Vol. 2, No. 11, November 1995; pp. 3933–4024&lt;/ref&gt;

These results prompted the DOE to request a custom military ICF facility they called the "Laboratory Microfusion Facility" (LMF). LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&amp;nbsp;MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted "Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Department of Energy's Inertial Confinement Fusion Program, Final Report, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

===LMF and Nova Upgrade===
Building the LMF was estimated to cost about $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;''Nova Upgrade - A Proposed ICF Facility to Demonstrate Ignition and Gain'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ICF Program, July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5&amp;nbsp;MJ 350&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) driver laser that would be able to reach about 200&amp;nbsp;MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals. The program was estimated to cost about $600&amp;nbsp;million FY 1989 dollars, and an additional $250&amp;nbsp;million to upgrade it to a full 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ if needed, and would grow to well over $1&amp;nbsp;billion if LMF was to meet all of the goals requested by the DOE.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; Other labs also proposed their own LMF designs using other technologies.

The National Academy of Sciences review led to a reevaluation of these plans, and in July 1990, LLNL responded with the Nova Upgrade, which would reuse the majority of the existing Nova facility, along with the adjacent Shiva facility. The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&amp;isnumber=&amp;arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650–655. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section, including the multi-pass design in the main amplifiers, and 18 beamlines (up from 10) that were split into 288 "beamlets" as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination. The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&amp;nbsp;TW in a 4&amp;nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&amp;nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.

===NIF emerges===
Throughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.&lt;ref&gt;William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]], which would ban all [[critical mass|criticality]] testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.

[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber. In 2012 NIF achieved a 500 terawatt shot—1,000 times more power than the [[electric energy consumption#World electricity consumption (2012)|United States uses at any instant in time]].]]
Out of these changes came the [[Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)&lt;/ref&gt; with completion in 2002.

In spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had "virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues" and that "Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves".&lt;ref&gt;"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: "NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period".&lt;ref&gt;L. Spohn, "NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was "designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )&lt;/ref&gt; Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Federico Peña, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 |df= }} )&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructing NIF===

Work on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet. Beamlet operated between 1994 and 1997 and was entirely successful. It was then sent to [[Sandia National Laboratories]] as a light source in their [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]]. A full-sized demonstrator then followed, in AMPLAB, which started operations in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;J. A.

At the time, the DOE was estimating that the NIF would cost approximately $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion and another $1&amp;nbsp;billion for related research, and would be complete as early as 2002.&lt;ref name=GAO1&gt;''[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/rc00141.pdf NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY, Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays]'', GAO, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1997 the DOE approved an additional $100&amp;nbsp;million in funding and pushed the operational date back to 2004. As late as 1998 LLNL's public documents stated the overall price was $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion, with the first eight lasers coming online in 2001 and full completion in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Howard T. Powell and Richard H. Sawicki, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the National Ignition Facility]'', S&amp;TR, March 1998. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical scale of the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the "conventional facility" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.

There were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726024319/https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |title=Education: Fusion Fun: NIFFY, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125052443/https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF's 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were needed to withstand NIF's high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osolin |first=Charles |url=http://www.innovation-america.org/harnessing-power-light |title=Harnessing the Power of Light |publisher=Innovation America |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |title=National Ignition Facility: The Seven Wonders of NIF, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017204200/https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandia, with extensive experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.&lt;ref name=peer/&gt; Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&amp;nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt;

===Re-baseline and GAO report===
[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]

Throughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain. In 1999 then [[Secretary of Energy]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] reported to Congress that the NIF project was on time and budget, following the information that had been passed onto him by NIF's management. In August that year it was revealed that NIF management had misled Richardson, and in fact neither claim was close to the truth.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;James Glanz, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/081900sci-laser-missiles.html Laser Project Is Delayed and Over Budget]'', New York Times, August 19, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As the GAO would later note, "Furthermore, the Laboratory's former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and the Congress that the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems".&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt; Richardson later commented "I have been very concerned about the management of this facility... bad management has overtaken good science. I don't want this to ever happen again". A DOE Task Force reporting to Richardson late in January 2000 summarized that "organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project... [and that] ...no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE's office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.seab.energy.gov/publications/nif_rpt.pdf Interim Report of the National Ignition Facility Laser System Task Force]'', Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, January 10, 2000.

Given the budget problems, the [[US Congress]] requested an independent review by the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO). They returned a highly critical report in August 2000 stating that the budget was likely $3.9 billion, including R&amp;D, and that the facility was unlikely to be completed anywhere near on time.&lt;ref name="GAO1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fas101&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.101.htm GAO Report Cites New NIF Cost Estimate]'', FYI, American Institute of Physics, Number 101: August 30, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report, "''Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays''," identified management problems for the overruns, and also criticized the program for failing to include a considerable amount of money dedicated to target fabrication in the budget, including it in operational costs instead of development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Early technical delays and project management issues caused the DOE to begin a comprehensive "Rebaseline Validation Review of the National Ignition Facility Project" in 2000, which took a critical look at the project, identifying areas of concern and adjusting the schedule and budget to ensure completion. [[John A. Gordon|John Gordon]], National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated "We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project... The independent review supports our position that the NIF management team has made significant progress and resolved earlier problems".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hoffman, ''[http://lanl-the-rest-of-the-story.blogspot.com/2007/06/nuclear-testing-gear-in-doubt-livermore.html Nuclear testing gear in doubt]'', MediaNews Group,&lt;/ref&gt; The report revised their budget estimate to $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion, not including related R&amp;D which pushed it to $3.3&amp;nbsp;billion total, and pushed back the completion date to 2006 with the first lines coming online in 2004.&lt;ref name=fas65&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.065.htm New Cost and Schedule Estimates for National Ignition Facility]'', FYI: The API Bulletin of Science Policy News, American Institute of Physics.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up report the next year included all of these items, pushing the budget to $4.2 billion, and the completion date to around 2008.

===Progress after rebaselining===

Miller (physicist)|George Miller]] (who later became LLNL director 2006-2011), who was named acting associate director for lasers. [[Ed Moses (physicist)|Ed Moses]], former head of the [[Atomic vapor laser isotope separation|Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation]] (AVLIS) program at LLNL, became NIF project manager. Since the rebaselining, NIF's management has received many positive reviews and the project has met the budgets and schedules approved by Congress. In October 2010, the project was named "Project of the Year" by the [[Project Management Institute]], which cited NIF as a "stellar example of how properly applied project management excellence can bring together global teams to deliver a project of this scale and importance efficiently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2010/Oct/NR-10-10-03.html |title=National Ignition Facility wins prestigious 2010 project of the year award |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 11, 2010 |website=llnl.gov |publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reviews of the project have been positive, generally in keeping with the post-GAO Rebaseline schedules and budgets. However, there were lingering concerns about the NIF's ability to reach ignition, at least in the short term. An independent review by the [[JASON Defense Advisory Group]] was generally positive about NIF's prospects over the long term, but concluded that "The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely".&lt;ref name=jason&gt;''[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/nif.pdf NIF Ignition]'', JASON Program, June 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The group suggested a number of changes to the completion timeline to bring NIF to its full design power as soon as possible, skipping over a testing period at lower powers that they felt had little value.

===Early tests and construction completion ===
In May 2003, the NIF achieved "first light" on a bundle of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ pulse of IR light in a single beamline.&lt;ref name=performance/&gt; In 2005 the first eight beams (a full bundle) were fired producing 153 kJ of infrared light, thus eclipsing OMEGA as the highest energy laser (per pulse) on the planet. By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the Master Oscillator Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed. By August 2007 96 laser lines were completed and commissioned, and "A total infrared energy of more than 2.5 megajoules has now been fired. This is more than 40 times what the Nova laser typically operated at the time it was the world's largest laser".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html World's largest laser picks up the pace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234734/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html |date=2010-05-27 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, November 21, 2007.

===Buildup to main experiments===
On January 28, 2010, the facility published a paper reporting the delivery of a 669 kJ pulse to a gold [[hohlraum]], setting new records for power delivery by a laser, and leading to analysis suggesting that suspected interference by generated plasma would not be a problem in igniting a fusion reaction.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting like tiny prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt;

After gradually altering the wavelength of the laser, they were able to compress a spherical capsule evenly, and were able to heat it up to 3.3 million [[kelvin]]s (285 eV).&lt;ref name="Bullis"/&gt; The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuel capsules that will be used later on.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt; Plasma Physics Group Leader Dr. Siegfried Glenzer said they've shown they can maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the laser system.&lt;ref name="Bullis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/energy/24720/ |title=Scientists Overcome Obstacle to Fusion |author=Bullis, Kevin |date=January 28, 2010 |publisher=''[[Technology Review]]'' |accessdate=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2010, the NIF could run as high as 1.8 megajoules. Glenzer said that experiments with slightly larger hohlraums containing fusion-ready fuel pellets would begin before May 2010, slowly ramping up to 1.2 megajoules &amp;mdash; enough for ignition according to calculations. But first the target chamber needed to be equipped with shields to block [[neutrons]] that a fusion reaction would produce.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; On June 5, 2010 the NIF team fired lasers at the target chamber for the first time in six months; realignment of the beams took place later in June in preparation for further high-energy operation.&lt;ref name="Status2010June"&gt;

===National Ignition Campaign===
[[File:Technician inside NIF target chamber.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Technician works on target positioner inside National Ignition Facility (NIF) target chamber.]]
With the main construction complete, NIF started working on the "National Ignition Campaign" (NIC), the quest to reach ignition. By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. [[Scientific American]] started a 2010 review article with the statement "Ignition is close now. Within a year or two..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |pages=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1&amp;nbsp;MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.

Progress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |publisher=''[[Scientific American]]'' |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.&lt;ref name=kramerreview&gt;David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html "NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.&lt;ref name="kramerreview"/&gt; Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as "a goal of overriding importance for the DOE" and expressed that progress to date "was not as rapid as I had hoped".&lt;ref name=kramerreview/&gt;

NIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.

ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility &amp; Photon Science News - Archive - Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision. The shots tested the symmetry of the X-ray drive during the first three [[nanosecond]]s. Full-system shots fired in the second half of May achieved unprecedented peak pressures of 50&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|megabar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = NIC Team Launches Precision Tuning Campaign | title = Stockpile Stewardship and Diamond EOS Experiments | work = Project Status – 2011 (May) | publisher = Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date = May 2011 | url = https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | accessdate = 2011-06-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003170516/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | archivedate = 2011-10-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Mike Dunne, director of NIF's laser fusion energy program, predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SPIE Europe Ltd |url=http://optics.org/news/3/1/37 |title=PW 2012: fusion laser on track for 2012 burn |publisher=Optics.org |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the NIF fired a record high of 57 shots, more than in any month up to that point.&lt;ref name=nature201203&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-nears-crucial-milestone-1.10175 |accessdate=21 Mar 2012 |date=7 March 2012 |title=Laser fusion nears crucial milestone |author=Eric Hand |work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2012, NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 trillion watts of peak power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/23/nif_laser_pulse/|title=Record-breaking laser pulse raises fusion-power hopes|accessdate=2012-03-22 | date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2012, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/07/12/worlds-most-powerful-laser-fires-most-powerful-laser-blast-ever/|title=World's most powerful laser fires most powerful laser blast ever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DOE Report, July 19, 2012===
The NIC campaign has been periodically reviewed by a team led by [[Steven E. Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="Crandall"&gt;
{{cite web
| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf
| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign
| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt; The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:
:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&amp;nbsp;Memo&amp;nbsp;2012,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;2)

Further, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

The report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===
The NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition. According to numerous articles in the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William J. Broad |author-link=William Broad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/science/fusion-project-faces-a-frugal-congress.html |title=So Far Unfruitful, Fusion Project Faces a Frugal Congress |date=September 30, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=New York Times Dot-Earth Blog |title=With Tight Research Budgets, Is There Room for the Eternal Promise of Fusion? |date=18 October 2012|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/with-tight-research-budgets-is-there-room-for-the-eternal-promise-of-fusion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress was concerned about the project's progress and funding arguments may begin anew.&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Hatcher |url=http://optics.org/indepth/3/10/2 |title=NIF responds to fusion 'deadline' expiry |website=optics.org |date=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Perlman |url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Livermore-Lab-Ignition-Facility-s-woes-3797461.php |title=Livermore Lab Ignition Facility's woes |publisher=SFGate |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/forschak/1845698/ |title=Superlaser zündet nicht - Experimente am NIF lauren nicht so glatt die &amp;#124; Forschung Aktuell &amp;#124; Deutschlandfunk |publisher=Dradio.de |date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports also suggested that NIF will shift its focus away from ignition back toward materials research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Geoff |last=Brumfiel |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=worlds-most-powerful-laser-facility-shifts-focus-to-warheads |title=World's Most Powerful Laser Facility Shifts Focus to Warheads |journal=Scientific American |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |title=Editorial: Ignition switch |url=http://www.nature.com/news/ignition-switch-1.11748 |date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, as NIF was reaching completion, LLNL began the [[Laser Inertial Fusion Energy]] program, or LIFE, to explore ways to use the NIF technologies as the basis for a commercial power plant design. Early studies considered the [[fission-fusion hybrid]] concept, but from 2009 the focus was on pure fusion devices, incorporating a number of technologies that were being developed in parallel with NIF that would greatly improve the performance of the design. All of these, however, were based on the idea that NIF would achieve ignition, and that only minor changes to the basic design would be required to improve performance. In April 2014, Livermore decided to end the LIFE efforts. Bret Knapp, Livermore acting director was quoted as saying that "The focus of our inertial confinement fusion efforts is on understanding ignition on NIF rather than on the LIFE concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livermore Ends LIFE |website=Physics Today |date=April 2014 |first=David |last=Kramer |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/67/4/10.1063/PT.3.2344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memo sent on 29 September 2013 by Ed Moses describes a fusion shot that took place at 5:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 28 September. It produced 5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons, 75% more than any previous shot. Alpha heating, a key component of ignition, was clearly seen. It also noted that the reaction released more energy than the "energy being absorbed by the fuel", a condition the memo referred to as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/laser-fusion-experiment-yields-record-energy-llnls-national-ignition-facility
| title=Laser fusion experiment yields record energy at Lawrence Livermore's National Ignition Facility
| publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]
| date=2013-08-26
| accessdate=2017-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This received significant press coverage as it appeared to suggest a key threshold had been achieved, which was referred to as a "milestone".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24429621 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of researchers pointed out that the experiment was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Clery |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really-%E2%80%A6 |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF? Uh, Not Really |website=ScienceInsider |date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that the definition of breakeven as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed to refer to the energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale |last=Meade |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy |date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used to reach these levels, known as the "high foot", is not suitable for general ignition, and as a result, it is still unclear whether NIF will ever reach this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2013/10/progress-at-nif-but-no-breakthrough.html |title=Progress at NIF, but no 'breakthrough' |website=LaserFocusWorld |date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockpile experiments ===

Since that time, NIF has returned to materials studies. Experiments beginning in 2015 FY have used plutonium targets, with a schedule containing 10 to 12 shots for 2015, and as many as 120 over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/my-town/ci_27426991/despite-objections-lawrence-livermore-lab-go-forward-plutonium |title=Despite objections, Livermore lab to fire world's largest laser at plutonium |newspaper=Contra Cost Times |date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by [[high explosive]]s, which has not seen direct testing since the Comprehensive Test Ban. Tiny amounts of plutonium are used in these tests, ranging from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams.&lt;ref name=pumercury/&gt; Similar experiments are also carried out on Sandia's [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independentnews.com/news/plutonium-experiments-expected-on-national-ignition-facility/article_eafe840c-86ff-11e4-b122-13c4c0a58c69.html |title=Plutonium Experiments Expected On National Ignition Facility |first=Jeff |last=Garberson |date=19 December 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Livermore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of LLNL's Primary Nuclear Design Program, Mike Dunning, noted that "This is an opportunity for us to get high-quality data using a regime that was previously unavailable to us".&lt;ref name=pumercury&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |title=Lawrence Livermore National Lab to test plutonium using NIF laser |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_27119177/lawrence-livermore-lab-test-plutonium-using-nif-laser |date=12 December 2014 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key development on NIF since the Ignition Campaign has been an increase in the shot rate. Although designed to allow shots as often as every 4 hours,{{efn|One source suggested the ultimate aim was one shot per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stolz, "The National Ignition Facility" The world's largest optical system", Optical Design and Testing III, edited by Yongtian Wang, Theo T. Tschudi, Jannick P. Rolland, Kimio Tatsuno Proc. SPIE Vol. 6834, 683402, (2007) · {{DOI|10.1117/12.773365}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 2014 FY NIF performed 191 shots, slightly more than one every two days. This has been continuously improved, and in April 2015 NIF was on track to meet its goal of 300 laser shots in 2015 FY, almost one a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/efficiency-improvements |title=NIF Lasers Continue to Fire at a Record Rate |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MagLIF experiments===

On 28 January 2016, NIF successfully executed its first gas pipe experiment intended to study the absorption of large amounts of laser light within {{convert|1|cm}} long targets relevant to high-gain [[Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion]] (MagLIF).  In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was very favorable and analysis is ongoing by scientific staff at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories.

[[File:Yarnton Manor east.JPG|thumb|[[Yarnton Manor]], the former location of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]]
The '''Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies''' ('''OCHJS''') is a [[Recognised Independent Centre]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. Its [[research fellows]] teach on a variety of undergraduate and master's degrees in [[Oriental studies]], and it publishes the ''[[Journal of Jewish Studies]]''.

==History and case statement==
The Centre was founded in 1972 by Dr David Patterson to help restore Jewish Studies in Europe in the aftermath of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/home/about/our-vision/ |title=Our vision and mission statement |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is based in the [[Clarendon Institute]], [[Walton Street]], [[Oxford]], OX1 2HG, having relocated from [[Yarnton Manor]] in 2014. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] and a company limited by guarantee incorporated in [[England]], under [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|309720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is the leading academic Jewish studies centre in [[Europe]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} Its Fellows and Lecturers provide courses in Hebrew and Jewish studies for undergraduates and postgraduates up to doctoral level in many faculties within the [[University of Oxford]]. The Centre also promotes Jewish studies based on the [[Bodleian Library]]’s Hebrew and Jewish collections by supporting research, by development projects, and by shared staffing with the Centre’s Leopold Muller Memorial Library.

==Leopold Muller Memorial Library==
[[File:Milenamanor6.jpg|thumb|upright|Muller Library collections]]
The Centre's library is named the '''Leopold Muller Memorial Library'''. It is housed in the basement of the Clarendon Institute.

[[File:Oxford Internet Institute Front Door.jpg|thumb|Front door of the Oxford Internet Institute on St Giles, Oxford.]]
The '''Oxford Internet Institute''' ('''OII''') is a multi-disciplinary department of social and computer science dedicated to the study of information, communication, and technology, and is part of the [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]] of the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is housed over three sites on [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles]] in [[Oxford]], including a primary site at 1 St Giles, owned by [[Balliol College]]. The department undertakes research and teaching devoted to understanding life online, with the aim of shaping [[Internet]] research, policy, and practice.

Founded in 2001, the OII has tracked the Internet's development and use, aiming to shed light on individual, collective and institutional behaviour online. The department brings together academics from a wide range of disciplines including political science, sociology, geography, economics, philosophy, physics and psychology.

Professor [[William H. Dutton]] served as Director of the OII from 2001 to 2011. Professor [[Helen Margetts]] occupied the Directorship between 2011 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/?id=580|title=Professor Helen Margetts Appointed Director of the Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=7 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is Professor [[Philip N. Howard]].

== Research ==
Research at the OII covers a huge variety of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including [[privacy]] and [[Computer security|security]], [[e-government]] and [[e-democracy]], [[Virtual economy|virtual economies]], [[Smart city|smart cities]], digital exclusion, [[digital humanities]], online gaming, [[big data]] and [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]. The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: 
* Digital Politics and Government 
* Information Governance and Security 
* Social Data Science 
* [http://cii.oii.ox.ac.uk Connectivity, Inclusion and Inequality] 
* Internet Economies 
* [http://dkc.oii.ox.ac.uk Digital Knowledge and Culture] 
* Education, Digital Life and Wellbeing 
* [http://epic.oii.ox.ac.uk Ethics and Philosophy of Information]

The faculty and students of the OII have made many advances to the study of technology and society. Director [[Helen Margetts]]' book Political Turbulence was the first book-length manuscript on the impact of social media on public life.  [[Viktor Mayer-Schönberger]]'s book Big Data was the first to define and explain the importance of big data in contemporary economics, culture, and politics.  Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] was the first political scientist to define and study [[astroturfing]] and has been responsible for significant research on fake news, bots and trolls in international affairs.  [[Luciano Floridi]] is the world's leading ethicist on AI and big data.

===Studies of Wikipedia===
OII has published several studies in Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, the Guardian Data Blog published maps of [[geotagged]] Wikipedia articles written in English, [[Arabic]], [[Egyptian Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/11/wikipedia-map-world-languages | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Rogers | title=The world of Wikipedia's languages mapped | date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OII Senior Research Fellow Mark Graham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=165|title=Dr. Mark Graham|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the study and published the results on his blog, ''Zero Geography''.&lt;ref name="zerogeography"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Graham|title=Mapping Wikipedia's augmentations of our planet|url=http://www.zerogeography.net/2011/11/mapping-wikipedias-augmentations-of-our.html|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia's Networks and Geographies: Representation and Power in Peer-Produced Content|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=66|publisher=Oxford Internet Institute|accessdate=2014-09-04|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, OII researchers published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to "edit wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1305.5566v2|last1=Yasseri|first1=Taha|title=The most controversial topics in Wikipedia: A multilingual and geographical analysis|last2=Spoerri|first2=Anselm|last3=Graham|first3=Mark|last4=Kertész|first4=János|class=physics.soc-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of late, the OII has, amongst other things, been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the [[Big data ethics|ethics of big data]] in different contexts and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It closely collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the department for computer science and the Oxford Martin School.

== Teaching ==
Since 2006, the OII has offered a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] (doctoral) degree in "Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/teaching/dphil/|title=Oxford Internet Institute's D.

==History==
The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the [[Shirley Foundation]] of over £10m, with public funding totalling over £5m from the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].

The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP, was quickly espoused by Colin Lucas, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol.  Two Balliol Fellows, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, approached Dame Stephanie for support.

The Oxford Internet Institute is part of a small network of research centres that includes the centres like the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and [[Information Society Project]] at Yale Law School.  But it is the only one that functions as a fully functioning, degree-granting department.

'''Pseudophysics''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice using the language of [[physics]] or discussing issues related to or pertinent to physics to promote ideas which are either incoherent or contradictory to known physics (experimental phenomenology). According to physicists, skeptics, and science writers, pseudophysics tends to be promoted by so-called "[[crank (person)|cranks]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.about.com/b/2012/02/17/physicscranks.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whose ideas lack [[peer review]], lack [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]], and/or blatantly contradict scientific facts and experimental results. [[Mathematical physicist]] [[John C. Baez]] famously invented a [[crackpot index]] to give an idea of what sort of claims and rhetoric were commonplace among pseudophysics proposals he had come across.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">'''Pub Philosophy''' is a term sometimes used to describe organised gatherings in [[public house]]s for [[philosophical]] discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Billington, R: ''Living Philosophy An Introduction to Moral Thought, 3rd Edition''. Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several series of events in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere offer pub philosophy in a variety of formats, typically involving an invited speaker and some degree of open discussion. Among the more long-standing of these are:

*Big Ideas (based in London, UK) https://web.archive.org/web/20100912055756/http://bigi.org.uk/
*Kant's Cave (held in London, UK, by [[Philosophy For All]])

*The [[Stoa]] (based in [[Faversham]], Kent, UK)
*[[Skeptics in the Pub]]
*Thinking While Drinking (based in [[San Diego]], [[California]]) http://thinkingwhiledrinking.org

Pub Philosophy groups, while often run by amateurs, have sometimes been recruited by more mainstream institutions to provide a distinctively participatory public forum. Such alliances have included [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[University of Chester]] working with Philosophy in Pubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/eventseducation/talksdiscussions/22109.htm Tate Liverpool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108093210/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/eventseducation/talksdiscussions/22109.htm |date=2010-11-08 }} Retrieved 02-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Brighton Science Festival]] 2010 working with PIPS Brighton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brightonscience.com/2010/programme/pips.html Brighton Science Festival 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721203722/http://www.brightonscience.com/2010/programme/pips.html |date=2012-07-21 }} Retrieved 02-09-10&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[London School of Economics]] producing an event in collaboration with Big Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/forumForEuropeanPhilosophy/events/PanelDiscussion.htm London School of Economics] Retrieved 02-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spy Booth''''' was an artwork by [[Banksy]] in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBCJun14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28032154|title=Fears Banksy Cheltenham 'spies' artwork will be removed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece has been seen as a critique of the [[global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Morris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/10/banksy-creator-spy-booth-wall-art-gchq|title=Banksy confirms he is creator of Spy Booth wall art near GCHQ |publisher=The Guardian|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Robin Barton and [[Bankrobber London]] helped with the preservation of the artwork,&lt;ref name=BBCJun29_6_14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-28078938 |title=Cheltenham Banksy: Deal to save it 'close to agreement'|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=29 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempted to broker the removal and sale of the piece. However the artwork was painted onto a Grade II [[listed building]] - [[153-159 Fairview Road]] - and the council prevented it from being removed, giving it retrospective listed building consent in 2015 and affording it some protection from removal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48356">The theory of '''structuration''' is a [[social theory]] of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based in the analysis of both ''[[Social structure|structure]]'' and ''[[Agency (sociology)|agents]]'' (see [[structure and agency]]), without giving primacy to either. Further, in structuration theory, neither [[Microsociology|micro]]- nor [[Macrosociology|macro-focused]] analysis alone is sufficient. The theory was proposed by [[sociologist]] [[Anthony Giddens]], most significantly in ''The Constitution of Society'',&lt;ref name="The constitution of society"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giddens|first=A.|year=1984|title=The constitution of society: Outline of the theory of structuration|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=978-0-520-05728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents. Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory"&gt;Stones, R. (2005). ''Structuration theory.'' New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the theory has received much criticism, it remains a pillar of contemporary [[sociological theory]].&lt;ref name="Critical appreciation"&gt;Bryant, C.G.A., &amp;amp; Jary, D. (1991). Coming to terms with Anthony Giddens. In C.G.A. Bryant &amp;amp; D. Jary (Eds.), ''Giddens' theory of structuration: A critical appreciation'' (pp. 1-32). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

==Premises and origins==
Sociologist Anthony Giddens adopted a [[post-empiricism|post-empiricist]] frame for his theory, as he was concerned with the abstract characteristics of social relations.{{according to whom|date=May 2012}} This leaves each level more accessible to analysis via the [[Ontology|ontologies]] which constitute the human social experience: space and time ("and thus, in one sense, 'history'.")&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|3}} His aim was to build a broad social theory which viewed "[t]he basic domain of study of the social sciences... [as] neither the experience of the individual actor, nor the existence of any form of societal totality, but social practices ordered across space and time."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|189}} His focus on abstract [[ontology]] accompanied a general and purposeful neglect of [[epistemology]] or detailed [[research methodology]].

Giddens used concepts from [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivist]] and [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] social theories, discarding objectivism's focus on detached structures, which lacked regard for humanist elements and subjectivism's exclusive attention to individual or group agency without consideration for socio-structural context. He critically engaged classical nineteenth and early twentieth century social theorists such as [[Positivism#Comte's positivism|Auguste Comte]], [[Materialism#Materialist conception of history and Marx|Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Erving Goffman]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Thus, in many ways, structuration was "an exercise in clarification of logical issues."&lt;ref name="New rules of sociological method"&gt;Giddens, A. (1993). ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii}} Structuration drew on other fields, as well: "He also wanted to bring in from other disciplines novel aspects of ontology that he felt had been neglected by social theorists working in the domains that most interested him. Thus, for example, he enlisted the aid of geographers, historians and philosophers in bringing notions of time and space into the central heartlands of social theory."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Giddens hoped that a subject-wide "coming together" might occur which would involve greater cross-disciplinary dialogue and cooperation, especially between [[anthropologists]], social scientists and sociologists of all types, historians, geographers, and even novelists. Believing that "literary style matters", he held that social scientists are communicators who share frames of meaning across cultural contexts through their work by utilising "the same sources of description (mutual knowledge) as novelists or others who write fictional accounts of social life."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|285}}

Structuration differs from its historical sources. Unlike structuralism it sees the reproduction of social systems not "as a mechanical outcome, [but] rather ... as an active constituting process, accomplished by, and consisting in, the doings of active subjects."&lt;ref name="New rules of sociological method" /&gt;{{rp|121}} Unlike [[Althusser]]'s concept of agents as "bearers" of structures, structuration theory sees them as active participants. Unlike the [[philosophy of action]] and other forms of [[interpretative sociology]], structuration focuses on structure rather than production exclusively. Unlike [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] production of an utterance, structuration sees language as a tool from which to view society, not as the constitution of society—parting with [[Structural linguistics|structural linguists]] such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[generative grammar]] theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]]. Unlike [[post-structuralist]] theory, which put similar focus on the effects of time and space, structuration does not recognise {{em|only}} movement, change and transition. Unlike [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], in which structures and their virtual synonyms, "systems", comprise organisations, structuration sees structures and systems as separate concepts. Unlike [[Marxism]], structuration avoids an overly restrictive concept of "society" and Marxism's reliance on a universal "motor of history" (i.e. [[class conflict]]), its theories of societal "adaptation", and its insistence on the working class as universal class and socialism as the ultimate form of modern society. Finally, "structuration theory cannot be expected to furnish the moral guarantees that [[critical theorists]] sometimes purport to offer."&lt;ref name="Critical appreciation" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

== Duality of structure ==
Giddens observed that in social analysis, the term ''structure'' referred generally to "rules and resources" and more specifically to "the structuring properties allowing the 'binding' of time-space in social systems". These properties make it possible for similar social practices to exist across time and space and that lend them "systemic" form.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Agents—groups or individuals—draw upon these structures to perform social actions through embedded memory, called ''memory traces''. Memory traces are thus the vehicle&lt;!-- need a word here that is not metaphorical. I thought maybe "means" but later "modality" gets that definition. --&gt; through which social actions are carried out. Structure is also, however, the result of these social practices. Thus, Giddens conceives of the ''duality of structure'' as being:
{{Quote|...the essential recursiveness of social life, as constituted in social practices: structure is both medium and outcome of reproduction of practices. Structure enters simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and 'exists' in the generating moments of this constitution.&lt;ref name="Central problems"&gt;Giddens, A. (1979). ''Central problems in social theory: Action, structure, and contradiction in social analysis.'' Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

Giddens uses "the duality of structure" (i.e. material/ideational, micro/macro) to emphasize structure's nature as both medium and outcome. Structures exist both internally within agents as memory traces that are the product of phenomenological and hermeneutic inheritance&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|27}} and externally as the manifestation of social actions. Similarly, social structures contain agents and/or are the product of past actions of agents. Giddens holds this duality, alongside "structure" and "system," in addition to the concept of recursiveness, as the core of structuration theory.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|17}} His theory has been adopted by those with [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] inclinations, but who wish to situate such structures in human practice rather than to [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reify]] them as an [[ideal type]] or material property. (This is different, for example, from [[actor–network theory]] which appears to grant a certain autonomy to technical artifacts.)

Social systems have patterns of social relation that change over time; the changing nature of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure.&lt;!-- huh? changing nature of s&amp;t? --&gt; Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be beyond the realm of human control—the [[positivistic]] approach—or posit that action creates them—the [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivist]] approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different sides to the same central question of how social order is created.

[[Gregor McLennan]] suggested renaming this process "the duality of structure {{em|and agency}}", since both aspects are involved in using and producing social actions.&lt;ref name="Critical assessments"&gt;McLennan, G. (1997/2000/2001). Critical or positive theory? A comment on the status of Anthony Giddens' social theory. In C.G.A. Bryant &amp; D. Jary (Eds.), ''Anthony Giddens: Critical assessments'' (pp. 318-327). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322}}

=== Cycle of structuration ===
The duality of structure is essentially a [[feedback]]–[[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]]{{clarify|date=May 2012}} process whereby agents and structures mutually enact social systems, and social systems in turn become part of that duality.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Structuration thus recognizes a social cycle. In examining social systems, structuration theory examines ''structure'', ''[[Modalities (sociology)|modality]]'', and ''interaction''. The "modality" (discussed below) of a structural system is the means by which structures are translated into actions.

==== Interaction ====
Interaction is the agent's activity within the social system, space and time. "It can be understood as the fitful yet routinized occurrence of encounters, fading away in time and space, yet constantly reconstituted within different areas of time-space."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|86}} [[Unspoken rule|Rule]]s can affect interaction, as originally suggested by [[Goffman]]. "Frames" are "clusters of rules which help to constitute and regulate activities, defining them as activities of a certain sort and as subject to a given range of sanctions."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|87}} Frames are necessary for agents to feel "ontological security, the trust that everyday actions have some degree of predictability. Whenever individuals interact in a specific context they address—without any difficulty and in many cases without conscious acknowledgement—the question: "What is going on here?" Framing is the practice by which agents make sense of what they are doing.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

==== Routinization ====
Structuration theory is centrally concerned with ''order'' as "the transcending of time and space in human social relationships".&lt;ref name="The constitution of society"/&gt; ''[[Institutionalization#Institutionalization|Institutionalized]] action'' and ''routinization'' are foundational in the establishment of social order and the reproduction of social systems. Routine persists in society, even during social and political revolutions, where daily life is greatly deformed, "as Bettelheim demonstrates so well, routines, including those of an obnoxious sort, are re-established."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|87}} Routine interactions become institutionalized features of social systems via tradition, custom and/or habit, but this is no easy societal task and it "is a major error to suppose that these phenomena need no explanation. On the contrary, as [[Goffman]] (together with [[ethnomethodology]]) has helped to demonstrate, the routinized character of most social activity is something that has to be 'worked at' continually by those who sustain it in their day-to-day conduct."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Therefore, routinized social practices do not stem from coincidence, "but the skilled accomplishments of knowledgeable agents."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;!--this reads as though Bettelheim (routines are durable) contradicts Goffman (routines have to be "worked at"--&gt;

''Trust'' and ''tact'' are essential for the existence of a "basic security system, the sustaining (in ''praxis'') of a sense of ontological security, and [thus] the routine nature of social reproduction which agents skilfully organize. The monitoring of the body, the control and use of face in '[[facework|face work]]'—these are fundamental to social integration in time and space."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

==== Explanation ====
{{Quote|When I utter a sentence I draw upon various syntactical rules (sedimented in my practical consciousness of the language) in order to do so. These structural features of the language are the medium whereby I generate the utterance. But in producing a syntactically correct utterance I simultaneously contribute to the reproduction of the language as a whole. ...The relation between moment and totality for social theory... [involves] a dialectic of presence and absence which ties the most minor or trivial forms of social action to structural properties of the overall society, and to the coalescence of institutions over long stretches of historical time.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|24}}}}
Thus, even the smallest social actions contribute to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a ''[[dialectic]] of control'' (discussed below) which allows them to break away from normative actions. Depending on the social factors present, agents may cause shifts in social structure.

The cycle of structuration is not a defined sequence; it is rarely a direct succession of causal events. Structures and agents are both internal and external to each other, mingling, interrupting, and continually changing each other as feedbacks and feedforwards occur. Giddens stated, "The degree of "[[systemness]]" is very variable. ...I take it to be one of the main features of structuration theory that the extension and 'closure' of societies across space and time is regarded as problematic."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

The use of "patriot" in political speech reflects this mingling, borrowing from and contributing to nationalistic norms and supports structures such as a [[police state]], from which it in turn gains impact.

==Structure and society==
Structures are the "rules and resources" embedded in agents' memory traces. Agents call upon their memory traces of which they are "knowledgeable" to perform social actions. "Knowledgeability" refers to "what agents know about what they do, and why they do it."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Giddens divides memory traces (''structures-within-knowledgeability''&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;) into three types:
* Domination (power): Giddens also uses "resources" to refer to this type. "Authoritative resources" allow agents to control persons, whereas "allocative resources" allow agents to control material objects.
* Signification (meaning)
* Legitimation (norms): Giddens sometimes uses "rules" to refer to either signification or legitimation. An agent draws upon these ''stocks of knowledge'' via memory to inform him or herself about the external context, conditions, and potential results of an action.

When an agent uses these structures for social interactions, they are called ''modalities'' and present themselves in the forms of facility (domination), interpretive scheme/communication (signification) and norms/sanctions (legitimation).

Thus, he distinguishes between overall "structures-within-knowledgeability" and the more limited and task-specific "modalities" on which these agents subsequently draw when they interact.

The duality of structures means that structures enter "simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and 'exists' in the generating moments of this constitution."&lt;ref name="Central problems" /&gt;{{rp|5}} "Structures exist paradigmatically, as an absent set of differences, temporally "present" only in their instantiation, in the constituting moments of social systems."&lt;ref name="Central problems" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Giddens draws upon [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]] in theorizing that structures and their meaning are understood by their differences.

==Agents and society==
Giddens' agents follow previous [[psychoanalysis]] work done by [[Sigmund Freud]] and others.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Agency, as Giddens calls it, is human action. To be human is to be an agent (not all agents are human). Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens calls the "reflexive monitoring of actions."&lt;ref name="Modernity and self-identity"&gt;Giddens, A. (1991). ''Modernity and self-identity: Self and society in the late modern age.'' Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reflexive monitoring" refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently "rationalize," or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and expect the same from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization, they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, must be knowledgeable must be able to rationalize the action; and must reflexively monitor the action.

Agents, while bounded in structure, draw upon their knowledge of that structural context when they act. However, actions are constrained by agents' inherent capabilities and their understandings of available actions and external limitations. ''Practical consciousness'' and ''discursive consciousness'' inform these abilities. Practical consciousness is the knowledgeability that an agent brings to the tasks required by everyday life, which is so integrated as to be hardly noticed. Reflexive monitoring occurs at the level of practical consciousness.&lt;ref name="Ordinary consumption"&gt;Ilmonen, K. (2001). Sociology, consumption, and routine. In J. Gronow &amp; A. Warde (Eds.), ''Ordinary Consumption'' (pp. 9-25). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive consciousness is the ability to verbally express knowledge. Alongside practical and discursive consciousness, Giddens recognizes actors as having reflexive, contextual knowledge, and that habitual, widespread use of knowledgeability makes structures become institutionalized.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

Agents rationalize, and in doing so, link the agent and the agent's knowledgeability. Agents must coordinate ongoing projects, goals, and contexts while performing actions. This coordination is called reflexive monitoring and is connected to ethnomethodology's emphasis on agents' intrinsic sense of accountability.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

The factors that can enable or constrain an agent, as well as how an agent uses structures, are known as ''capability constraints'' include age, cognitive/physical limits on performing multiple tasks at once and the physical impossibility of being in multiple places at once, available time and the relationship between movement in space and movement in time.

Location offers are a particular type of capability constraint. Examples include:
* Locale
* Regionalization: political or geographical zones, or rooms in a building
* Presence: Do other actors participate in the action? (see [[Dynamic awareness theory#Presence|co-presence]]); and more specifically
* Physical presence: Are other actors physically nearby?

Agents are always able to engage in a ''dialectic of control'', able to "intervene in the world or to refrain from such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|14}} In essence, agents experience inherent and contrasting amounts of autonomy and dependence; agents can always either act or not.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

==Methodology==
Structuration theory is relevant to research, but does not prescribe a methodology and its use in research has been problematic. Giddens intended his theory to be abstract and theoretical, informing the hermeneutic aspects of research rather than guiding practice. Giddens wrote that structuration theory "establishes the internal logical coherence of concepts within a theoretical network."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Giddens criticized many researchers who used structuration theory for empirical research, critiquing their "en bloc" use of the theory's abstract concepts in a burdensome way. "The works applying concepts from the logical framework of structuration theory that Giddens approved of were those that used them more selectively, 'in a spare and critical fashion.'"&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Giddens and followers used structuration theory more as "a sensitizing device".&lt;ref name="Turner 1986"&gt;Turner, J.H. (1986). Review essay: The theory of structuration. ''American Journal of Sociology'', ''91''(4), 969-977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuration theory allows researchers to focus on any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes [[ontology]] over [[epistemology]]. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, [[Expectation (epistemic)|agent expectations]], relative degrees of routine, [[tradition]], behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, [[Unintended consequences|intended and unintended consequences]], skilled and knowledgeable agents, [[explicit knowledge|discursive]] and [[tacit knowledge]], dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]].&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

Giddens preferred ''strategic conduct analysis'', which focuses on contextually situated actions. It employs detailed accounts of agents' knowledgeability, motivation, and the dialectic of control.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

==Criticisms and additions==
Though structuration theory has received critical expansion since its origination,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Giddens' concepts remained pivotal for later extension of the theory, especially the duality of structure.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Strong structuration===
Rob Stones argued that many aspects of Gidden's original theory had little place in its modern manifestation. Stones focused on clarifying its scope, reconfiguring some concepts and inserting new ones, and refining methodology and research orientations. Strong structuration:
#Places its ontology more [[in situ]] than abstractly.&lt;!--what does that mean?--&gt;
#Introduces the ''quadripartite cycle'', which details the elements in the duality of structure. These are:
#* ''external structures'' as conditions of action;
#* ''internal structures'' within the agent;
#* ''active agency'', "including a range of aspects involved when agents draw upon internal structures in producing practical action";&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|9}} and
#* ''outcomes'' (as both structures and events).
#Increases attention to epistemology and methodology. Ontology supports epistemology and methodology by prioritising:
#* the question-at-hand;
#* appropriate forms of methodological bracketing;
#* distinct methodological steps in research; and
#* "[t]he specific combinations of all the above in composite forms of research."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|189}}
#Discovers the "meso-level of ontology between the abstract, philosophical level of ontology and the ''in-situ'', [[ontic]] level."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Strong structuration allows varied abstract ontological concepts in experiential conditions.
#Focuses on the meso-level at the temporal and spatial scale.
#Conceptualises ''independent causal forces'' and ''irresistible causal forces'', which take into account how external structures, internal structures, and active agency affect agent choices (or lack of them). "Irresistible forces" are the connected concepts of a horizon of action with a set of "actions-in-hand" and a hierarchical ordering of purposes and concerns. An agent is affected by external influences. This aspect of strong structuration helps reconcile an agent's dialectic of control and his/her more constrained set of "real choices."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

===Post-structuration and dualism===
[[Margaret Archer]] objected to the inseparability of [[structure and agency]] in structuration theory.&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;Archer, M. (1995). ''Realist social theory: The morphogenetic approach.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a notion of ''dualism'' rather than "duality of structure". She primarily examined structural frameworks and the action within the limits allowed by those conditions. She combined realist ontology and called her methodology ''analytical dualism''. Archer maintained that structure precedes agency in social structure reproduction and analytical importance, and that they should be analysed separately. She emphasised the importance of temporality in social analysis, dividing it into four stages: structural conditioning, social interaction, its immediate outcome and structural elaboration. Thus her analysis considered embedded "structural conditions, emergent causal powers and properties, social interactions between agents, and subsequent structural changes or reproductions arising from the latter."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Archer criticised structuration theory for denying time and place because of the inseparability between structure and agency.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

Nicos Mouzelis reconstructed Giddens' original theories.&lt;ref name="Conceptualising constraint"&gt;Healy, K. (1998). "Conceptualising constraint: Mouzelis, Archer, and the concept of social structure." ''Sociology, 613''(4), pp.613-635.&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis kept Giddens' original formulation of structure as "rules and resources." However, he was considered a dualist, because he argued for dualism to be as important in social analysis as the duality of structure.&lt;ref name="Restructuring structuration theory"&gt;Mouzelis, N. (1989). "Restructuring structuration theory." ''The Sociological Review, 32''(3), pp.509-522.&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis reexamined human social action at the "[[Syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]]" (syntactic) level. He claimed that the duality of structure does not account for all types of social relationships. Duality of structure works when agents do not question or disrupt rules, and interaction resembles "natural/performative" actions with a practical orientation. However, in other contexts, the relationship between structure and agency can resemble dualism more than duality, such as systems that are the result of powerful agents. In these situations, rules are not viewed as resources, but are in states of transition or redefinition, where actions are seen from a "strategic/monitoring orientation."&lt;ref name="Back to sociological theory" /&gt;{{rp|28}} In this orientation, dualism shows the distance between agents and structures. He called these situations "syntagmatic duality". For example, a professor can change the class he or she teaches, but has little capability to change the larger university structure. "In that case, syntagmatic duality gives way to syntagmatic dualism."&lt;ref name="Back to sociological theory"&gt;Mouzelis, N. (1991). ''Back to sociological theory: The construction of social orders.'' New York, NY: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} This implies that systems are the outcome, but not the medium, of social actions. Mouzelis also criticised Giddens' lack of consideration for social hierarchies.

John Parker built on Archer and Mouzelis's support for dualism to propose a theoretical reclamation of historical sociology and macro-structures using concrete historical cases, claiming that dualism better explained the dynamics of social structures.&lt;ref name="Parker structuration theory"&gt;Parker, J. (2000). ''Structuration'' Buckingham: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Robert Archer developed and applied analytical dualism in his critical analysis of the impact of New Managerialism on education policy in England in Wales during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Archer |first1=Robert |title=Education policy and realist social theory : primary teachers, child-centred philosophy and new managerialism. |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415464338 |url=https://www.routledge.com/Education-Policy-and-Realist-Social-Theory-Primary-Teachers-Child-Centred/Archer/p/book/9780415464338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John B. Thompson===
{{Main|John Thompson (sociologist)}}
Though he agreed with the soundness and overall purposes of Giddens' most expansive structuration concepts (i.e., against dualism and for the study of structure in concert with agency), John B. Thompson ("a close friend and colleague of Giddens at Cambridge University")&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|46}} wrote one of the most widely cited critiques of structuration theory.&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology"&gt;Thompson, J.B. (1984). ''Studies in the theory of ideology''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His central argument was that it needed to be more specific and more consistent both internally and with conventional social structure theory. Thompson focused on problematic aspects of Giddens' concept of structure as "rules and resources," focusing on "rules". He argued that Giddens' concept of rule was too broad.

Thompson claimed that Giddens presupposed a ''criterion of importance'' in contending that rules are a generalizable enough tool to apply to every aspect of human action and interaction; "on the other hand, Giddens is well aware that {{em|some}} rules, or some kinds or aspects of rules, are much more important than others for the analysis of, for example, the social structure of capitalist societies."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} He found the term to be imprecise and to not designate which rules are more relevant for which social structures.

Thompson used the example of [[linguistic analysis]] to point out that the need for a prior framework which to enable analysis of, for example, the social structure of an entire nation. While [[semantic rule]]s may be relevant to social structure, to study them "presupposes some structural points of reference which are not themselves {{em|rules}}, with regard to which [of] these semantic rules are differentiated"&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} according to class, sex, region and so on. He called this ''structural differentiation.''

Rules differently affect variously situated individuals. Thompson gave the example of a private school which restricts enrollment and thus participation. Thus rules—in this case, restrictions—"operate {{em|differentially}}, affecting unevenly various groups of individuals whose categorization depends on certain assumptions about social structures."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} The isolated analysis of rules does not incorporate differences among agents.

Thompson claimed that Giddens offered no way of formulating ''structural identity''. Some "rules" are better conceived of as broad inherent elements that define a structure's identity (e.g., [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] are "capitalistic"). These agents may differ, but have important traits in common due to their "capitalistic" identity. Thompson theorized that these traits were not rules in the sense that a manager could draw upon a "rule" to fire a tardy employee; rather, they were {{em|elements}} which "{{em|limit}} the kinds of rules which are possible and which thereby {{em|delimit}} the scope for institutional variation."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|160}} It is necessary to outline the broader social system to be able to analyze agents, actors, and rules within that system.

Thus Thompson concluded that Giddens' use of the term "rules" is problematic. "Structure" is similarly objectionable: "But to adhere to this conception of structure, while at the same time acknowledging the need for the study of 'structural principles,' 'structural sets' and 'axes of structuration,' is simply a recipe for conceptual confusion."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|163}}

Thompson proposed several amendments. He requested sharper differentiation between the reproduction of institutions and the reproduction of social structure. He proposed an altered version of the structuration cycle. He defined "[[social institutions|institutions]]" as "characterized by rules, regulations and conventions of various sorts, by differing kinds and quantities of resources and by hierarchical power relations between the occupants of institutional positions."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|165}} Agents acting within institutions and conforming to institutional rules and regulations or using institutionally endowed power reproduce the institution. "If, in so doing, the institutions continue to satisfy certain structural conditions, both in the sense of conditions which delimit the scope for ''institutional variation'' and the conditions which underlie the operation of ''structural differentiation'', then the agents may be said to reproduce social structure."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

Thompson also proposed adding a ''range of alternatives'' to Giddens' conception of constraints on human action. He pointed out the paradoxical relationship between Giddens' "dialectic of control" and his acknowledgement that constraints may leave an agent with no choice. He demanded that Giddens better show how wants and desires relate to choice.

Giddens replied that a structural principle is not equivalent with rules, and pointed to his definition from ''A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism'': "Structural principles are principles of organisation implicated in those practices most "deeply" (in time) and "pervasively" (in space) sedimented in society",&lt;ref name="Contemporary critique"&gt;Giddens, A. (1981). ''A contemporary critique of historical materialism: vol 1: Power, property, and the state.'' London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} and described structuration as a "mode of institutional articulation"&lt;ref name="A reply to my critics"&gt;Giddens, A. (1989). A reply to my critics. In D. Held &amp; J. B. Thompson (Eds.), ''Social theory of modern societies: Anthony Giddens and his critics'' (pp.249-301). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|257}} with emphasis on the relationship between time and space and a host of institutional orderings including, but not limited to, rules.

Ultimately, Thompson concluded that the concept of structure as "rules and resources" in an elemental and ontological way resulted in conceptual confusion. Many theorists supported Thompson's argument that an analysis "based on structuration's ontology of structures as norms, interpretative schemes and power resources radically limits itself if it does not frame and locate itself within a more broadly conceived notion of social structures."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;

===Change===
Sewell provided a useful summary that included one of the theory's less specified aspects: the question "Why are structural transformations possible?" He claimed that Giddens' overrelied on rules and modified Giddens' argument by re-defining "resources" as the embodiment of cultural [[Schema (Kant)|schemas]]. He argued that change arises from the multiplicity of structures, the ''transposable'' nature of schemas, the unpredictability of resource accumulation, the [[polysemy]] of resources and the intersection of structures.&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

The existence of multiple structures implies that the knowledgeable agents whose actions produce systems are capable of applying different schemas to contexts with differing resources, contrary to the conception of a universal [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (learned dispositions, skills and ways of acting). He wrote that "Societies are based on practices that derived from many distinct structures, which exist at different levels, operate in different modalities, and are themselves based on widely varying types and quantities of resources. ...It is never true that all of them are homologous."&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;Sewell, Jr., W. H. (1992). A theory of structure: duality, agency, and transformation. ''The American Journal of Sociology, 98''(1):1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

Originally from [[Bourdieu]], ''transposable'' schemas can be "applied to a wide and not fully predictable range of cases outside the context in which they were initially learned." That capacity "is inherent in the knowledge of cultural schemas that characterizes all minimally competent members of society."&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

Agents may modify schemas even though their use does not predictably accumulate resources. For example, the effect of a joke is never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it based on the amount of laughter it garners regardless of this variability.

Agents may interpret a particular resource according to different schemas. E.g., a commander could attribute his wealth to military prowess, while others could see it as a blessing from the gods or a coincidental initial advantage.

Structures often overlap, confusing interpretation (e.g., the structure of capitalist society includes production from both private property and worker [[social solidarity|solidarity]]).

===Technology===
{{see also|Theories of technology}}
This theory was adapted and augmented by researchers interested in the relationship between [[technology]] and social structures, such as [[information technology]] in organizations. [[Gerardine DeSanctis |DeSanctis]] and Poole proposed an "adaptive structuration theory" with respect to the emergence and use of group decision support systems. In particular, they chose Giddens' notion of modalities to consider how technology is used with respect to its "spirit". "[[Appropriation (sociology)|Appropriation]]s" are the immediate, visible actions that reveal deeper structuration processes and are enacted with "moves". Appropriations may be faithful or unfaithful, be instrumental and be used with various attitudes.&lt;ref name="DeSanctis and Poole"&gt;Desanctis, G. &amp; Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory. ''Organization Science, 5''(2):121-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wanda Orlikowski]] applied her critique of the duality of structure to technology: "The duality of technology identifies prior views of technology as either objective force or as socially constructed product–as a false dichotomy."&lt;ref name="Orlikowski 1992"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. ''Organization Science, 3''(3):398-427. Earlier version at the URI http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/2300&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} She compared this to previous models (the technological imperative, strategic choice, and technology as a trigger) and considered the importance of meaning, power, norms, and interpretive flexibility. Orlikowski later replaced the notion of embedded properties&lt;ref name="DeSanctis and Poole" /&gt; for enactment (use). The "practice lens" shows how people enact structures which shape their use of technology that they employ in their practices.&lt;ref name="Orlikowski 2000"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. (2000). Using technology and constituting structures: a practice lens for studying technology in organizations. ''Organization Science, 11''(4):404-428.&lt;/ref&gt; While Orlikowski's work focused on corporations, it is equally applicable to the technology cultures that have emerged in smaller community-based organizations, and can be adapted through the ''gender sensitivity lens'' in approaches to technology governance.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2006"&gt;Stillman, L. (2006). (Ph.D Thesis). Understandings of Technology in Community-Based Organisations: A Structurational Analysis. Monash University, Australia. Retrieved from: http://webstylus.net/?q=node/182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workman, Ford and Allen rearticulated structuration theory as ''structuration agency theory'' for modeling socio-biologically inspired structuration in [[security software]].&lt;ref name="Workman, Ford, &amp; Allen 2008"&gt;Workman, M., Ford, R., &amp; Allen, W. (2008). A structuration agency approach to security policy enforcement in mobile ad hoc networks. ''Information Security Journal, 17'', 267-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Software agents join humans to engage in social actions of information exchange, giving and receiving instructions, responding to other agents, and pursuing goals individually or jointly.

===Business===
Pavlou and Majchrzak argued that research on business-to-business [[e-commerce]] portrayed technology as overly [[determinism|deterministic]]. The authors employed structuration theory to re-examine outcomes such as economic/business success as well as trust, coordination, innovation, and shared knowledge. They looked beyond technology into organizational structure and practices, and examined the effects on the structure of adapting to new technologies. The authors held that technology needs to be aligned and compatible with the existing "trustworthy"&lt;ref name="Business to business"&gt;Pavlou, P.A&gt;, &amp; Majchrzak, A. (2002). Structuration theory: Capturing the complexity of business-to-business intermediaries. In M. Warkentin (Ed.), ''Business to business electronic commerce: Challenges &amp; solutions'' (pp.175-189). Hershey, PA: Idea Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} practices and organizational and market structure. The authors recommended measuring long-term adaptations using ethnography, monitoring and other methods to observe causal relationships and generate better predictions.

===Group communication===
Poole, Seibold, and McPhee wrote that "group structuration theory,"&lt;ref name="Group communication"&gt;Waldeck, J.H., Shepard, C.A., Teitelbaum, J., Farrar, W.J., &amp; Seibold, D.R. (2002). New directions for functional, symbolic convergence, structuration, and bona fide group perspectives of group communication. In L.R. Frey (Ed.), ''New directions in group communication'' (pp.3-25). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} provides "a theory of group interaction commensurate with the complexities of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Group communication 2"&gt;Poole, M.S., Seibold, D.R., &amp; McPhee, R.D. (1996). The structuration of group decisions. In R.Y. Hirokawa &amp; M.S. Poole (Eds.), ''Communication and group decision making'' (pp.114-146). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}

The theory attempts to integrate macrosocial theories and individuals or small groups, as well as how to avoid the binary categorization of either "stable" or "[[Emergent properties|emergent]]" groups.

Waldeck et al. concluded that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely explaining them. ''Decision rules'' support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that can be directly observable. Research has not yet examined the "rational" function of group communication and decision-making (i.e., how well it achieves goals), nor structural production or constraints. Researchers must empirically demonstrate the recursivity of action and structure, examine how structures stabilize and change over time due to group communication, and may want to integrate argumentation research.&lt;ref name="Group communication" /&gt;

===Public relations===
Falkheimer claimed that integrating structuration theory into [[public relations]] (PR) strategies could result in a less agency-driven business, return theoretical focus to the role of power structures in PR, and reject massive PR campaigns in favor of a more "holistic understanding of how PR may be used in local contexts both as a reproductive and [transformational] social instrument."&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;Falkheimer, J. (2009). On Giddens: Interpreting public relations through Anthony Giddens' structuration and late modernity theory. In O. Ihlen, B. van Ruler, &amp; M. Frederiksson (Eds.), ''Public relations and social theory: Key figures and concepts'' (pp.103-119). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}} Falkheimer portrayed PR as a method of communication and action whereby social systems emerge and reproduce. Structuration theory reinvigorates the study of space and time in PR theory. Applied structuration theory may emphasize community-based approaches, storytelling, rituals, and informal communication systems. Moreover, structuration theory integrates all organizational members in PR actions, integrating PR into all organizational levels rather than a separate office. Finally, structuration reveals interesting ethical considerations relating to whether a social system {{em|should}} transform.&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3790">'''SRANK''' or '''Subnational Rank''' seeks to ascertain the rarity of [[species]] within subnational boundaries (such as a [[province]] or [[State (administrative division)|state]]).

Below is the ranking definitions used by the [[Ontario]] [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]], and will vary by province or state.  This ranking system is widely used by the conservation data centres in each of the provinces and states.  Refer to NatureServe for the overall ranking system used by conservation data centres (CDCs) across North America as well as the actual S-ranks of all the species evaluated.  OMNR is one such CDC.

* '''SX — Presumed Extirpated'''  Species or community is believed to be extirpated from the province or state.  Not located despite intensive searches of historical sites and other appropriate habitat, and virtually no likelihood that it will be rediscovered.
* '''SH — Possibly Extirpated (Historical)'''  Species or community occurred historically in the province or state, and there is some possibility that it may be rediscovered.  Its presence may not have been verified in the past 20–40 years. A species or community could become SH without such a 20-40 year delay if the only known occurrences in a province or state were destroyed or if it had been extensively and unsuccessfully looked for. The SH rank is reserved for species or communities for which some effort has been made to relocate occurrences, rather than simply using this status for all elements not known from verified extant occurrences.
* '''S1 — Critically Imperiled'''  Critically imperiled in the province or state because of extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer occurrences) or because of some factor(s) such as very steep declines making it especially vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S2 — Imperiled'''  Imperiled in the province or state because of rarity due to very restricted range, very few populations (often 20 or fewer), steep declines, or other factors making it very vulnerable to extirpation from the province or state.
* '''S3 — Vulnerable'''  Vulnerable in the province or state due to a restricted range, relatively few populations (often 80 or fewer), recent and widespread declines, or other factors making it vulnerable to extirpation.
* '''S4 — Apparently Secure'''  Uncommon but not rare; some cause for long-term concern due to declines or other factors.
* '''S5 — Secure'''  Common, widespread, and abundant in the state or province.
* '''SNR — Unranked'''  Province or state conservation status not yet assessed.
* '''SU — Unrankable'''  Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends.
* '''SNA — Not Applicable'''  A conservation status rank is not applicable because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities.
* '''S#S# — Range Rank'''  A numeric range rank (e.g., S2S3) is used to indicate any range of uncertainty about the status of the species or community. Ranges cannot skip more than one rank (e.g., SU is used rather than S1S4).

A similar ranking system is used for the "G-ranks" and "N-ranks" which are the Global (G) and National (N) status ranks for species.  Again refer to NatureServe.org for additional details.

{{IB}}
'''Theory of knowledge''' is a required subject in the [[International Baccalaureate]] Diploma Programme. It is similar to [[epistemology]] courses offered at many universities.

==Course description==
Theory of Knowledge is a course created by the IB organization and must not be conceived as pure epistemology. This course involves a process of exploring and sharing students' views on ''"knowledge questions"'' (an umbrella term for "everything that can be approached from a TOK point of view"), so "there is no end to the valid questions that may arise", "there are many different ways to approach TOK," "the sheer scope of the TOK course is daunting" and "teachers and students need the confidence to go too far outside their traditional comfort zones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=3–4 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers are entitled to select a teaching methodology and course material that will convey the theoretical foundation of essential concepts and may provide an environment in which these concepts can be discussed and debated. The focus of the discussion should not be the differentiation between "right" and "wrong" ideas but on the quality of justification and a balanced approach to the knowledge claim in question.

The TOK course uses a combination, in no particular order ("many entry points and sequences are possible"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=6–35 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ways of knowing'': ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], [[faith]], [[imagination]], [[intuition]], [[memory]], and [[language]]). How do we gain knowledge of the world, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each way in which we learn of the world and our place in it. Until the fall of 2014, there were only four ways of knowing ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], and [[language]], but the IB curriculum then changed to include four other ways of knowing: [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[imagination]], [[faith]], and [[memory]]).
* ''Areas of knowledge'' ([[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[religion|religious knowledge systems]], [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]): their distinct natures and methods of gaining knowledge, the types of claim each makes and the issues to consider (e.g., "How do you know that the scientific method is a valid method of gaining knowledge?", "What is the reason for having historical knowledge, and how is it applied in life?"). The IB originally had six areas of knowledge: [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]. In the fall of 2014, the IB curriculum changed to include two more areas of knowledge: [[religion|religious knowledge systems]] and [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]].
* Factors that transcend individual ways of knowing and areas of knowledge:
** ''Nature of knowing'': what are the differences between information, data, belief, faith, opinion, knowledge and wisdom?
** ''Knowledge communities'': what is taken for granted in a community? How can we decide which beliefs we ought to check further?
** ''Knowers' perspective and applications of knowledge'': how do age, education, culture and experience influence selection of sources and formation of knowledge claims? If you know something, or how to do something, do you have a responsibility to use your knowledge? By using different types of AOK ( Areas of knowledge ) and WOK ( Ways of knowing ) you can then start to write counterclaims and claims in different types of texts.

** ''[[Theory of justification|Justifications]] of knowledge claims'': why should claims be assessed critically? Are [[logic]], [[sensory perception]], [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[memory]], [[consensus]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], and [[self-awareness]] equally reliable justifications? Use of [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]], [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[pragmatism]], and [[consensus]] as [[criteria of truth]].

The TOK course is expected to involve 100 teaching hours over the two years of the Diploma Programme.&lt;ref name="TOK_Guide_p3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=3 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having followed the course, students should be competent to analyse knowledge claims and respond to knowledge issues in the context of different areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, expressing ideas accurately and honestly, using examples from their own experiences as learners and in outside life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=5 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Personal knowledge is the systematic assimilation of shared knowledge acquired in different areas of knowledge through a process that vary within disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Knowledge Guide|last=|first=|publisher=International Baccalaureate Organization|year=2013|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=17-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shared knowledge is the accumulation of bodies of knowledge in different areas of knowledge, the media and society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The Knowledge Framework is a scheme that contains five elements: scope and application, language, methodology, historical development and links to personal knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Assessment==
Theory of knowledge is assessed in two parts: an externally examined 1,200–1,600 word essay and an internally assessed presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=41 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part is scored using assessment criteria (four criteria for the essay and four for the presentation) that describe levels of achievement (e.g., ''"The inquiry explores knowledge issues. Most points are justified; most arguments are coherent. Some counterclaims are considered."'' describes level 5–6 in one of the essay criteria). The total score is converted into a grade from A to E. A similar system is used for the [[extended essay]] and students can gain up to 3 points for the diploma based on the grades achieved for TOK and EE. No diploma is awarded if a candidate fails to submit either the TOK essay or TOK presentation, or receives grade E for either the extended essay or theory of knowledge.

===TOK essay===
For each exam session the IB prescribes 6 essay titles from which students must choose, e.g., ''"All knowledge claims should be open to rational criticism. On what grounds and to what extent would you agree with this assertion?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Core: Diploma requirements – 2 Theory of knowledge |title=2009 Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Program |publisher=ibo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each title raises generic cross-disciplinary questions about knowledge, and the student is expected to consider the issues raised in the title and reach conclusions about them. The essay should put forward claims and counterclaims, linking knowledge issues to areas of knowledge and ways of knowing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=44 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and show evidence of original thinking by the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |title="Help" with IB assessment tasks |accessdate=2009-08-11 |publisher=ibo.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420133851/http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essays over the maximum word count of 1,600 are penalised with a one mark reduction, and any content beyond the 1600th word of the essay is not read by the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ibpublishing.ibo.org/exist/rest/app/tsm.xql?doc=d_0_tok_gui_1304_1_e&amp;part=3&amp;chapter=3|title= Assessment Details|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2013 |website= Theory of Knowledge guide|publisher= [[International Baccalaureate Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TOK presentation===
During the Theory of Knowledge course, students must plan and deliver at least one (in individual or small group, maximum three students) presentation to the class. The topic is based on a real-life situation of interest to the student, e.g. "Reliability of media reporting of science", "What makes something a work of art?" and the presentation is expected to show why the topic is significant, linking it to a relevant main knowledge question (KQ), and discussing those issues and examining the implications of approaching the question from different perspectives, given by WOKs (ways of knowing), taken through one or two of the AOKs (Areas of knowledge). Teachers have wide latitude to help with topic selection and identifying suitable approaches. About ten minutes should be allowed for each presenter, and almost any form is permitted (e.g. debates, games, skits, interviews etc.) except reading an essay aloud. If a candidate reads an essay, they are very likely to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=46–50, 57–60 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://presentationexamples.org/tok-presentation-example/ | title= Theory of knowledge presentation: Tips and Pitfalls | work=presentationexamples.org |date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Voluntarism''', sometimes referred to as '''voluntary action''', is the principle that individuals are free to choose goals and how to achieve them within the bounds of certain societal and cultural constraints, as opposed to actions that are coerced or [[predetermined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=161, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteerism==
Volunteer management specialist Susan Ellis differentiates between "voluntarism" and "[[volunteerism]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Voluntarism" (the older term) refers to everything voluntary. In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire "[[voluntary sector]]," but "voluntary" in the "voluntarism" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within "voluntarism" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as [[Unrelated Business Income Tax]] legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan J. Ellis |title=Volunt/ar/eer/ism: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030822/https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Perkins |url=http://www.learningtogive.org/papers/paper67.html |title=Voluntarism |publisher=Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Kish Sklar |url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |date=1998 |title=The "Quickened Conscience"], |publisher=Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806053219/http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism is also used to describe non-coercive methods of recruiting soldiers, from participants in European and American military service to youthful combatants in civil war in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |title=Military History: Second World War: Homefront, 1940–45 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213221221/http://www.lermuseum.org/ler/mh/wwii/voluntarism.html |archivedate=December 13, 2007 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}; {{cite book |author=John O'Sullivan |title=From Voluntarism to Conscription: Congress and Selective Service, 1940–1945 |year=1982}}; {{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webS0228.pdf |format=PDF |title=The End of Conscription in Europe? |author=Christopher Jehn |author2=Zachary Selden |publisher=National Security Division, Congressional Budget Office, United States Congress |date=2002 |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}; {{cite web |author=Krijn Peters |url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |title=Re-Examining Voluntarism, Youth Combatants in Sierra Leone: Monograph No 100 |publisher=[http://iss.co.za Institute for Security Studies] |date=April 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615210147/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/Monographs/No100/Contents.html |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations.  In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/UNITED%20KINGDOM/VOLUNTARISM-EN.htm |title=United Kingdom, Voluntarism |publisher=Eurofound |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on "pure and simple" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Brian Robertson |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=38781 |title=Voluntarism Against the Open Shop: Labor and Business Strategies in the Battle for American Labor Markets] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |journal=Studies in American Political Development |date=April 1999 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=146–85 |accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] political science professor [[Richard E. Flathman]] argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations," which he describes as "of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard E. Flathman |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xvqIeEeVSyIC&amp;dq=voluntarism&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 |title=Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice |publisher=[[Cornell University Press#press|Cornell University Press]] |year=1992 |page=76 |isbn=9780801499555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], voluntarism is an important aspect of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]], as well as other theories of [[social action]] and [[agency (sociology)|agency]].

[[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryists]], [[free market]] advocates, [[libertarians]] and [[anarchists]] call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David T.

==Examples from American history==

{{Globalise|USA|date=August 2018}}

Voluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.
* [[William Penn]], who established the Quakers in the late 17th century, preached taking responsibility for others and improving the world.
* [[Cotton Mather]], who lived during the colonial period, encouraged the formation of associations and causes.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] organized a voluntary militia in Quaker-controlled Pennsylvania, whose pacifist legislature refused to support the American revolutionary war.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted the unusually large number of voluntary associations in America.
* The [[Underground Railroad]] was a network of volunteers who helped slaves escape from their captors in the South.
* [[Dorothea Dix]], a nurse, recruited and trained other women as nurses during the Civil War.
* [[Clara Barton]] also served as a Civil War nurse and went on to establish the American Red Cross in 1881 for relief of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.
* [[Jane Addams]] opened a settlement house in 1889 to teach volunteers how to help the poor improve their lives.
* In 1995, 93 million Americans volunteered an average of 4.3 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;

==Content==
The book is an "anthropology of science" that explores the dualistic distinction [[modernity]] makes between [[nature]] and [[society]]. [[Pre-modern]] peoples, argues Latour, made no such division. Contemporary matters  of public concern such as [[global warming]], the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and emerging [[biotechnologies]] mix politics, science, popular and specialist discourse to such a degree that a tidy nature/culture dualism is no longer possible. This inconsistency has given rise to [[post-modern]] and [[Anarcho-primitivism|anti-modern]] movements&lt;!--NOTE: the link to "Anarcho-primitivism" is only a rough and far from ideal fit to Latour's conception of "anti-modernism". Insert a better one if you can--&gt;. Latour attempts to reconnect the social and natural worlds by arguing that the modernist distinction between nature and culture never existed. He claims we must rework our thinking to conceive of a "Parliament of Things" wherein [[natural phenomena]], [[social phenomena]] and the [[discourse]] about them are not seen as separate objects to be studied by [[experts|specialist]]s, but as [[wikt:hybrid|hybrids]] made and scrutinized by the public interaction of people, things and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
