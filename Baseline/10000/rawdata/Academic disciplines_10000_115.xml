      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F.

[[File:Battle of Germany (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 4526).jpg|thumb|''Battle of Germany'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1944 ]]
During World War II, the relations between art and war can be articulated around two main issues. First, art (and, more generally, culture) found itself at the centre of an ideological war. Second, during World War II, many artists found themselves in the most difficult conditions (in an occupied country, in [[Nazi concentration camp|internment camps]], in [[death camps]]) and their works are a testimony to a powerful "urge to create." Such creative impulse can be interpreted as the expression of self-preservation, a survival instinct in critical times.

==Historical context==
[[File:Battle of Britain (Paul Nash).png|thumb|''Battle of Britain'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1941]]
War is a common theme in art and has inspired many great works. Throughout history, most representations of war depict military achievements and often show significant battle scenes. However, in the [[19th century]] a “turn” in the visual representation of war became noticeable. Artists started to show the disastrous aspects of war, instead of its glorified events and protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Bertrand-Dorléac (ed.), ''Les désastres de la guerre, 1800-2014'', exh. cat., Lens, Musée du Louvre-Lens, Somogy, 2014 ; Laura Brandon, ''Art and War'', London: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 26-35&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective is best exemplified by [[Francisco Goya]]’s series, [[The Disasters of War]] (1810-1820, first published in 1863), and [[Otto Dix]]’s portfolio, ''Der Krieg'' (published in 1924). 

During [[World War II]], both traditions are present. For instance, [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]’s ''Battle of Britain'' ([[1941 in art|1941]]) represents a scene of aerial combat between British and [[Wehrmacht|German fighters]] over the [[English Channel]]. On the other hand, André Fougeron’s ''Street of Paris'' ([[1943 in art|1943]]) focuses on the impact of war and occupation on civilians.

==Art in Nazi Germany==

===Nazi art===
{{Main article|Art of the Third Reich}}
{{See also|Paintings by Adolf Hitler}}
[[File:The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman.jpg|thumb|''The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'' by [[Vera Mukhina]], 1937]

In [[totalitarian]] regimes (especially in [[Hitler]]’s Germany), the control of art and other cultural expressions was an integral part of the establishment of power. It reflects totalitarianism’s aim to control every single aspect of society and the individuals’ lives. However, art and culture had a special importance because they have the power to influence people, and they embody the identity of a nation, a community, a group of people.]]

In [[Nazi Germany]], Hitler's cultural politic was twofold. The first step was a “[[cultural cleansing]]”. German culture and society were said to be in decline because forces of decadence had taken over and corrupted it (it is the idea of the “enemy within”).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The cultural cleansing was to be accompanied by a “rebirth” of German culture and society (Hitler had grand plans for several [[Führermuseum|museums]]), which involved an exaltation of the “true spirit” of the German people in art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This officially sanctioned art was conservative and figurative, heavily inspired by [[Greco-Roman]] art. It was often grandiose and sentimental. In terms of contents, this art should represent and convey the regime's ideals.

In 1937 in Munich, two simultaneous events demonstrated the [[Nazis]]’ views about art. One exhibition displayed art that should be eliminated (“The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]”), while the other promoted, by contrast, the official aesthetic (“The Great German Art Exhibition”).

In Europe, other [[totalitarian]] regimes adopted a similar stance on art and encouraged or imposed an official aesthetic, which was a form of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Here Realism refers to a representational, mimetic style, and not to an art deprived of idealization. Such style was anchored in a prestigious tradition – popular, easy to understand, and thus practical for [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] aims.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It was clear in [[Stalin]]’s [[Soviet Union]], where diversity in the arts was proscribed and “[[Socialist Realism]]” was instituted as the official style. [[Modern art]] was banned as being decadent, [[bourgeois]] and elitist.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The comparison of sculptures placed by national pavilions during the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 International Exhibition]] in Paris is revealing. The exhibition was dominated by the confrontation between Germany and the Soviet Union, with their imposing pavilions facing each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn Adès]] (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; On one side, Josef Thorak’s sculptures were displayed by the German pavilion’s entrance. And on the other, [[Vera Mukhina]]’s sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', was placed on top of the Soviet pavilion.

===Degenerate art===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing near the main entrance of [[Palazzo Venezia]] showing a painting taken from the National Museum of Naples Picture Gallery]]
[[File:Ausstellung entartete kunst 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Goebbels]] at the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]]]
{{Main article|Degenerate Art}}
{{See also|Nazi Plunder}}
The term “degenerate” was used in connection with the idea that modern artists and their art were compromising the purity of the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|German race]]. They were presented as elements of “racial impurity,” “parasites,” causing a deterioration of German society.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These decadent and “degenerate” forces had to be eradicated. Cultural actors who were labelled “un-German” by the regime were persecuted: they were fired from their teaching positions, artworks were removed from museums, books were burnt.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} All artists who did not fall in line with the party's ideology (above all [[Jewish]] and [[Communist]] artists) were “un-German.”
 
The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] (Munich, 19 July-30 Nov. 1937) was made out of works confiscated in German museums. The works were placed in unflattering ways, with derogatory comments and slogans painted around them (“Nature as seen by sick minds”, “Deliberate sabotage of national defense”...). The aim was to convince visitors that modern art was an attack on the German people. Mostly, these works of art were [[Expressionist]], abstract or made by Jewish and [[Leftist]] artists. The exhibition was displayed in several German and Austrian cities. Subsequently, most of the artworks were either [[art destruction|destroyed]] or sold.]]

Modern art could not fall in line with the Nazi values and taste for several reasons:
* its constant innovation and change
* its independency and freedom
* its cosmopolitanism and reticence to profess any type of nationalist allegiance
* its ambiguity and its lack of easily understandable and definitive meaning 
* its rejection and deconstruction of the mimetic tradition of representation{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

France was occupied by Nazi Germany from 22 June 1940 until early May 1945. An occupying power endeavours to normalise life as far as is possible since this optimises the maintenance of order and minimises the costs of occupation. The Germans decreed that life, including artistic life should resume as before (the war).}} There were exceptions. Jews were targeted, and their art collections confiscated. Some of this consisted of modern, [[degenerate art]] which was partly destroyed, although some was sold on the international art market. Masterpieces of European art were taken from these collectors and French museums and were sent to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale, Paris, Flammarion, 1995, chapter 5, « Butins de guerre » ; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008, p. 12 and following&lt;/ref&gt; Known political opponents were also excluded and overtly political art was forbidden.

==Persecuted artists==
{{See also|Degenerate Art#Fate of the artists and their work}}
During the rise of Nazism, some artists had expressed their opposition. Following the establishment of the [[Third Reich]], modern artists and those of Jewish ancestry were classed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]]. Any Jewish artists, or artists who were known opponents to the regime, were liable to imprisonment unless they conformed with the authorities’ view of what was "acceptable" in art. These artists were all in danger. Among those who chose to stay in Germany, some retreated into an “inner exile”, or “inner emigration"&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''Le nazisme et la culture'', éditions Complexe, 2006, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; (“Innere Emigration”).

Artists had the choice of collaborating or resisting. But most people in such a predicament will normally find a middle way. Resistance was dangerous and unlikely to escape fierce punishment and while collaboration offered an easier path principled objection to it was a strong deterrent to many if not most. The other options were withdrawal, finding refuge abroad or, for many, to take the pragmatic course by simply continuing to work within the new restrictions. Hence artistic life and expression appeared light, carefree and frivolous, but was also lively.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Alan Riding, ''And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2010; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiled artists===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05929, Berlin, KPD-Plakat zu den Reichstagswahlen.jpg|thumb|''5 Fingers Has The Hand'' by John Heartfield, 1928]]
The German artist [[John Heartfield]] (who had been part of [[Dada]] Berlin) is an example of an artist who expressed opposition. While Hitler's popularity was growing in Germany, he consistently produced photomontages that denounced the future dictator and his party. Most of them were published in ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'' [''AIZ'', Workers' Illustrated Newspaper], and a lot of them appeared on the cover. His artworks were like visual weapons against Nazism, a counter-power. In them, he subverted Hitler's figure and [[Nazi symbols]]. Through powerful visual juxtapositions, he revealed Nazism manipulations and contradictions, and showed the truth about them. As soon as Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power]] in 1933, Heartfield had to flee, finding refuge first in Prague and then in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Otto Dix]] had been labelled as a “degenerate” artist. His works were removed from museums, he was fired from his teaching position, and he was forbidden to create anything political as well as to exhibit. He moved to the countryside and painted landscapes for the duration of the war.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Many artists chose to leave Germany. But their exile did not secure their position in the art world abroad. Their personal and artistic security depended on the laws and attitude of the country of exile. Some sought collaboration with others in exile, forming groups to exhibit, such as the Free German League of Culture founded in 1938 in London.&lt;ref&gt;“Arts in Exile”, virtual exhibition, the German Exile Archive 1933-1945 of the German National Library, 2012: http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Topics/freier-deutscher-kulturbund-gro%C3%9Fbritannien-en.html (last retrieved: 04-04-2015)&lt;/ref&gt; One of their goals was to show that German culture and art were not to be equated with the cultural expressions sanctioned and produced by the Nazi regime.

Other artists went their own way, independently, often choosing apolitical subjects and sometimes refusing to participate in political events.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat.,  Los Angeles County Museum of Art; New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; They considered art as a completely autonomous activity that should not be submitted to a political cause. On the contrary, someone like [[Oskar Kokoschka]], who had until then rejected the idea that art should be useful and serve a cause, got involved in these groups when he emigrated to London in 1938. He created a series of political allegories, i.e. paintings in which he made comments on war politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat., Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997; Melody A. Maxted, “Envisioning Kokoschka: Considering the Artist’s Political Allegories, 1939-1954”, in ''Montage'', 2 (2008): 87-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists in internment camps===
Once the war had commenced, everyone of Austro-German extraction was considered to be a security risk in Britain and became an [[enemy alien]]. They were interned in 1940, in camps on the Isle of Man. In Britain, however, there was considerable concern that many who had opposed the Nazi regime and escaped with their lives were now in detention in poor conditions. This led to a form of re-classification that led to many early releases in 1940, and by 1942 most of the internees had been released.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Inside the camps, some of the inmates were artists, musicians, and other intelligentsia, and they rebuilt as much cultural life as they could within the constraints of their imprisonment: the giving of lectures and concerts and the creation of artworks from materials like charcoal from burnt twigs, dyes from plants and the use of lino and newspaper. They also received materials from the artistic community in Britain.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Heinz Kiwitz]] went into exile in 1937 after his release from imprisonment in [[Kemna concentration camp|Kemna]] and [[Emslandlager|Börgermoor concentration camps]]. [[Max Ernst]] exiled to the United States in 1941.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In France, Austro-German citizens also became “enemy aliens” at the outbreak of war and were sent in internment camps. The [[Camp des Milles]], near Aix-en-Provence, where German artists such as Max Ernst and [[Hans Bellmer]] were imprisoned, was famous for its artistic life.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As France was invaded, the situation of exiled German artists got more complicated and dangerous. They risked deportation, forced labour and extermination in the case of Jewish artists, both in occupied France and in the Vichy Republic. Most chose to emigrate further while others went into hiding.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the US, citizens of Japanese extraction also faced [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] in very poor living conditions and with little sympathy for their plight throughout the period of hostilities and beyond.

==World War II art==

===Protest art===

Those who wished to overtly oppose the Nazis in their art either worked abroad (for example, [[André Masson]]) or clandestinely, as part of the resistance movement (such as André Fougeron). In the public space, resistance took on more symbolic forms. A group known as 'Jeunes peintres de tradition française' exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1941. The works they produced during the period were characterised by semi-abstract art and bright colours, which they considered as a form of resistance to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Other supposedly non-political works were ambiguous – they observed the hardships of life in France without apportioning blame. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], who had stayed in Paris, painted but refused to exhibit. He did not paint the war or anything openly political, but he said that the war was in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Picasso, in Peter D. Whitney, “Picasso is Safe”, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 3 Sept. 1944, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern art became the bearer of liberal values, as opposed to the reactionary artistic preferences of the totalitarian regimes. Artistic choices embodied different positions in the ongoing ideological battle. Placing Alberto Sánchez Pérez's abstract sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;See Dawn Ades (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spanish people have a path that leads to a star'' (1937), at the entrance of the pavilion of the Spanish Republic was a political statement. So was commissioning modern artists to create works of art for this pavilion. [[Pablo Picasso]] showed two works: a pair of etchings entitled ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', 1937, and his monumental painting, [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]], 1937. [[Joan Miró]] painted a huge mural entitled ''Catalan Peasant in Revolt'' (aka [[The Reaper (Miró painting)|The Reaper]], destroyed), and he did a poster entitled “Aidez l’Espagne” (Help Spain), meant to support the Republicans’ cause. The American artist [[Alexander Calder]] created the abstract sculpture ''[[Mercury Fountain]]'' (1937). The involvement of a non-Spanish artist was also an important statement in an era dominated by the rise of nationalism, both in democratic and totalitarian regimes.

Even in democracies, voices called for a return to a more representational style. For instance, some criticized the central place given to Picasso's [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]] because it was not explicit enough in its denunciation and was too complex.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 25. Robin A. Greeley, S''urrealism and the Spanish Civil War'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; They would have preferred that the focus be placed on paintings such as [[Horacio Ferrer]]’s ''Madrid 1937 (Black Planes)'', from 1937. Its “message” was much clearer and – as a consequence – it functioned better as a political statement.

When they wanted to support the democratic cause and protest against [[Fascism]] and [[dictators]], artists were often encouraged to put aside their modernist style and express themselves in a more realist (i.e. representational) style. For instance, [[Josep Renau]], the Republican Government's director general of Fine Arts, said in 1937: “The poster maker, as an artist, knows a disciplined freedom, a freedom conditioned by objective demands, external to his individual will. Thus for the poster artist the simple question of expressing his own sensibility and emotion is neither legitimate nor practically realizable, if not in the service of an objective goal.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Renau, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;” And the French author, [[Louis Aragon]], declared in 1936: “For artists as for every person who feels like a spokesperson for a new humanity, the Spanish flames and blood put [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Aragon, in ''La Commune'', 1936, quoted by [[Lionel Richard]], ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995 (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt;” In other words, the artist's political engagement required a submission of the work's artistic aspects to the expression of the political content.

The series ''The Year of Peril'', created in [[1942 in art|1942]] by the American artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], illustrates how the boundary between art and propaganda can be blurred by such a stance. Produced as a reaction to the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] in 1941, the series portrayed the threat posed to the U.S. by Nazism and Fascism in an expressive but representational style. The message is clearly and powerfully delivered. These images were massively reproduced and disseminated in order to contribute to raise support for the U.S. involvement in World War II.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Thus, there can be troubling affinities between Allied politically-engaged art and fascist and totalitarian art when in both cases art and artists are used to create “persuasive images”, i.e. visual propaganda. Such a conception of political art was problematic for many modern artists as modernism was precisely defined by its autonomy from anything non-artistic. For some, absolute artistic freedom – and thus freedom from the requirement of having a clear, stable, and easily decipherable meaning – should have been what symbolised the liberal and progressive values and spirit of democracies.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political art===
[[File:Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire (Art. IWM ART LD 3859).jpg|thumb|''Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire'' by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], 1943]]
[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|''The City A fallen lift shaft'' by [[Graham Sutherland]], 1941]]
Britain was also subject to political differences during the 1930s but did not suffer repression nor civil war as elsewhere, and could enter World War II with a justifiable sense of defending freedom and democracy. Art had similarly followed the free expression at the heart of modernism, but political appropriation was already sought [as in the left-wing [[Artists’ International Association]] founded in 1933]. With the outbreak of war came official recognition of art's use as propaganda. However, in Britain, political promotion did not include the persecution of artistic freedom in general.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1939, the [[War Artists Advisory Committee]] (WAAC) was founded under the aegis of the British Ministry of Information, with the remit to list and select artists qualified to record the war and pursue other war purposes. Artists were thought to have special skills useful to a country at war:  they could interpret and express the essence of wartime experiences and create images that promoted the country's culture and values. Not the least of these was artists’ freedom to choose the subjects and style of their art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A significant influence was the choice of Sir [[Kenneth Clark]] as instigator and director of WAAC, as he believed that the first duty of an artist was to produce good works of art that would bring international renown. And he believed the second duty was to produce images through which a country presents itself to the world, and a record of war more expressive than a camera may give.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Important to this was the exhibition of Britain at War at [[New York Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York in 1941 (22 May to 2 September).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

This initiative also provided support for British artists when the world seemed to be sinking into barbarism. But it was not without intentions and constraints, and some works were rejected or censored. Accurate representations were required and abstract art, as it did not deliver a clear message, was avoided. Some depictions could be too realistic and were censored because they revealed sensitive information or would have scared people – and maintaining the nation's morale was vital. No foreign artists were admitted to the programme, a great sorrow to many who had fled to Britain from persecution elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite these restrictions, the work commissioned was illustrative, non-bombastic, and often of great distinction thanks to established artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Graham Sutherland]] and [[Stanley Spencer]].

===Holocaust art===
{{Main article|The Holocaust in popular culture}}
Many works of art and images were created by detainees in ghettos and in concentration and extermination camps. They form a large body of images. Most of them were small and fragile, many were destroyed and lost. The large majority of these images were created clandestinely because such a creative activity was forbidden and could have resulted in a death sentence. Yet, many inmates found materials and transgressed the rules in order to create.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Their motives for doing so were multiple but they all seem to have been linked to a survival instinct and self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 216: for some internees, art had a « live-saving function » (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt; Art could be a distraction and an escape from the horrors of the present. Distancing oneself (by depicting imaginary scenes or by taking on the role of the observer) was a way to keep some sanity. Doing drawings could also be a way to barter and thus to increase one's chances of survival in the camp or ghetto. Moreover, by creating visual artefacts there was the hope of creating something that would survive to one's death and would live on to testify to one's existence. Some seemed to have been animated by a documentary spirit: recording what was happening to them for people beyond the fence. Finally, such a creative urge was a form of cultural resistance. When their persecutors were trying to eradicate every bit of their humanity, artistic creation and testimony were ways to reclaim it, to preserve and cultivate it.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In terms of subject matters, the images created in concentration and extermination camps are characterised by their determination to enhance the detainees’ dignity and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably the most visible in the numerous portraits that were done. Whereas the Nazi extermination machine aimed at dehumanising the internees, creating “faceless” beings, clandestine artists would give them back their individuality. In this body of works, depictions of atrocities are not so frequent, which suggests that they might have been intentionally avoided. Rather, it is after the liberation, in the art of survivors that the most brutal and abominable aspects of concentration and extermination camps found a visual expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the face of such horrors, some artists were confronted with ethical problems and felt that representation had reached a limit. Thus, since the liberation of the camps, artists who have wanted to express the [[Holocaust]] in their art have often chosen abstraction or symbolism, thus avoided any explicit representations. A few went as far as to suggest that art itself – and not simply representational art – had reached a limit because creating an aesthetic object about the Holocaust would be, in itself, unethical, morally reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian College of Physical Education''' ('''ACPE''') is an independent specialist [[tertiary education]] institution in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. The college offers degree programmes in [[PDHPE]] teaching, [[physical education]], [[sports coaching]], [[health]] and [[physical fitness|fitness]], [[dance]] education, and [[sports management]]. The institute was founded in 1917, and is located at the [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. 

The college was founded in 1917 (making it the fourteenth-oldest tertiary education institution in Australia), initially as a physical education training institution for young women (the college only began admitting male students in 1971). The college's founder was Frank Stuart – a [[swordsman]], [[fencing]] instructor and physical training instructor, who had taught members of both the British and Russian Royal families, and went on to coach the Australian fencing teams for the 1950 [[Empire Games]] and the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]]. The college was initially located within the premises of Normanhurst School in the Sydney suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]]. It has an early connection with the Swords Club. (a connection recognised today through the college emblem), and in 1919 the club and the college were registered jointly as the ACPE and Swords Club Pty Ltd. 

The college moved to new premises in [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] in 1949, and then to [[Croydon, New South Wales|Croydon]] in 1970. In 1995, the college moved into the Sydney Olympic Park at [[Homebush Bay, New South Wales|Homebush Bay]], where the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]] were held. Students at the college regularly use the Olympic Park's facilities, such as the [[State Sports Centre|Sports Centre]], [[Sydney International Aquatic Centre|Aquatic Centre]] and [[NSW Tennis Centre|Tennis Centre]], for lectures and tutorials. Recently the College has moved to a brand new purpose built campus in Sydney Olympic Park at 10 Parkview Drive.

A '''biological rule''' or '''biological law''' is a generalized [[law (science)|law]], [[principle]], or [[rule of thumb]] formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allee |first=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |edition=2nd |pages=457, 460–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],&lt;ref name=Lovtrup/&gt; and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.&lt;ref name=Gloger/&gt;
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".&lt;ref name="Briggs1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Allen's rule]]''' states that the body shapes and proportions of endotherms vary by climatic temperature by either minimizing exposed surface area to minimize heat loss in cold climates or maximizing exposed surface area to maximize heat loss in hot climates. It is named after [[Joel Asaph Allen]] who described it in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel Asaph |last=Allen |title=The influence of Physical conditions in the genesis of species |journal=Radical Review |year=1877 |volume=1 |pages=108–140 |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/biogeog/ALLE1877.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry Holstun |last=Lopez |year=1986 |title=Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape |publisher=Scribner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-WxJYMD5HsC |isbn=0-684-18578-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bergmann's rule]]''' states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic [[clade]], populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions.

=== Sexual orientation, identity, and behavior ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual identity|Human sexual activity}}

Bisexuality is romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females. The [[American Psychological Association]] states that "sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime–different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual."&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |pages=63, 86|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011|quote=Sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual attraction, behavior, and identity may also be incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; The terms ''[[queer]]'',&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; ''[[Polysexuality|polysexual]]'',&lt;ref name="Firestein"/&gt; ''[[heteroflexible]]'', ''homoflexible,'' ''[[men who have sex with men]]'' and ''[[women who have sex with women]]'' may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.

Some sources state that bisexuality encompasses romantic or sexual attraction to all [[gender identity|gender identities]] or that it is romantic or sexual attraction to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender, equating it to or rendering it interchangeable with [[pansexuality]].&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the [[gender binary]], the "notion of two genders and indeed of specific sexual orientations",&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt; as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.&lt;ref name="Soble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and society"/&gt;

The bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]] defines bisexuality as "the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bi Revolution|year=2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rosario"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bisexuality as a transitional identity has also been examined. In a [[longitudinal study]] about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time.

=== Kinsey scale ===
{{Main|Kinsey scale}}

In the 1940s, the zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from heterosexuality to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero- or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.&lt;ref name="Young-Bruehl"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Young-Bruehl  |first=Elisabeth  |title=Are Human Beings "By Nature" Bisexual?  |journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality  |volume=3  |issue=2  |pages=179–213  |year=2001  |doi=10.1080/15240650209349175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html Kinseys hetero homo rating scale] Retrieved 7 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; People who rank anywhere from 2 to 4 are often considered bisexual; they are often not fully one extreme or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szymanski|first1=Mike|title=Moving Closer to the Middle: ''Kinsey'' the Movie, and Its Rocky Road to Bisexual Acceptance|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|date=2008|volume=8|issue=3–4|pages=287–308|doi=10.1080/15299710802501918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-19-509841-2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women|Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics and prevalence==
{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation|Kinsey Reports}}

Kinsey's 1948 work ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' found that "46% of the male population had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or 'reacted to' persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives".&lt;ref name=institute&gt;[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html Research Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726194522/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html |date=26 July 2010}} from the [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ Kinsey Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]], stating, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."&lt;ref name="Stange"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., &amp; Martin, C. E. (1948). ''Sexual behavior in the human male.'' Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. p 657.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', published in 1993, showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual and 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual.&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ"/&gt;

More modern studies estimating the demographics for bisexuality have varied. A 2002 survey in the United States by [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as "something else". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as "something else".&lt;ref name="Kinsey FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html|title=Frequently Asked Sexuality Questions to the Kinsey Institute |accessdate=16 February 2007 |publisher=The Kinsey Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an article in the 'Health' section of ''The New York Times'' stated that "1.5 percent of American women and 1.7 percent of American men identify themselves [as] bisexual."&lt;ref name="Carey" /&gt; Also in 2007, it was reported that 14.4 percent of young US women identified themselves as "not strictly heterosexual", with 5.6 percent of the men identifying as gay or bisexual.&lt;ref name="Lesbian and bisexual women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sax-sex/201004/why-are-so-many-girls-lesbian-or-bisexual?page=2 |title=Why Are So Many Girls Lesbian or Bisexual? |accessdate=28 April 2011 |author=Leonard Sax|publisher= Sussex Directories/''[[Psychology Today]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in the journal ''[[Biological Psychology (journal)|Biological Psychology]]'' in 2011 reported that there were men who identify themselves as ''bisexuals'' and who were aroused by both men and women.&lt;ref name=twsO28&gt;{{cite news| author = Elizabeth Landau| title = Bisexual men: Science says they're real| work = CNN| quote = ...confirms that men with bisexual arousal patterns and bisexual identity definitely exist...| date = 23 August 2011| url =  http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/23/bisexual-men-science-says-theyre-real/?hpt=hp_t2| accessdate = 2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first large-scale government survey measuring Americans' sexual orientation, the [[National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|NHIS]] reported in July 2014 that only 0.7 percent of Americans identify as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/health-survey-gives-government-its-first-large-scale-data-on-gay-bisexual-population/2014/07/14/2db9f4b0-092f-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html|title=Health survey gives government its first large-scale data on gay, bisexual population|work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an anthropological perspective, there is large variation in the prevalence of bisexuality between different cultures. Among some tribes, it appears to be non-existent while in others a universal, including the [[Sambia people|Sambia]] of [[New Guinea]] and similar [[Melanesian]] cultures.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] argued that adult sexual orientation can be explained in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed that in every embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for attraction to the opposite sex developed while the center for attraction to the same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. [[Simon LeVay]] has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of attraction to the same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeVay, Simon |authorlink=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld created a ten-point scale to measure the strength of sexual desire, with the direction of desire being represented by the letters A (for heterosexuality), B (for homosexuality), and A + B (for bisexuality). On this scale, someone who was A3, B9 would be weakly attracted to the opposite sex and very strongly attracted to the same sex, an A0, B0 would be asexual, and an A10, B10 would be very attracted to both sexes. LeVay compares Hirschfeld's scale to that developed by Kinsey decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=LeVay, Simon |authorlink=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that every human being is bisexual in the sense of incorporating general attributes of both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being an aspect of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side of this bisexual disposition would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that all adults still have desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders. Freud's belief in innate bisexuality was rejected by [[Sandor Rado|Sándor Radó]] in 1940 and, following Radó, by many later psychoanalysts. Radó argued that there is no biological bisexuality in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruse, Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |title=Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1988 |isbn=0 631 15275 X |pages=22, 25, 45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]] argued in ''[[Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?]]'' (1956) that bisexuality does not exist and that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bergler, Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Bergler |title=Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? |publisher=Hill and Wang, Inc |location=New York |year=1957 |isbn= |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith reported in ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) that sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that bisexuality is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bell, Alan P. |author2=Weinberg, Martin S. |author3=Hammersmith, Sue Kiefer |title=Sexual Preference: Its Development in Men and Women |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1981 |isbn=0-253-16673-X |pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letitia Anne Peplau ''et al.'' wrote that while Bell ''et al.''′s view that biological factors may be more influential on homosexuality than on bisexuality might seem plausible, it has not been directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |title=The Development of Sexual Orientation in Women |accessdate=11 July 2017 |author1=Peplau, Letitia Anne |author2=Spalding, Leah R. |author3=Conley, Terri D. |author4=Veniegas, Rosemary C. |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.&lt;ref name=VanWyk&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Wyk PH, Geist CS |title=Biology of Bisexuality: Critique and Observations |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=357–373 |year=1995 |doi=10.1300/J082v28n03_11 |pmid=7560936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation, biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported, with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.&lt;ref name=Veniegas&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Veniegas  |first=Rosemary c.  |author2=Terri D. Conley  |title=Biological Research on Women's Sexual Orientations: Evaluating the Scientific Evidence  |journal= Journal of Social Issues  |volume=56  |issue=2  |pages=267–282  |year=2000  |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has promoted bisexuality as an ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paglia, Camille |authorlink=Camille Paglia |title=Vamps and Tramps: New Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-14-024828-5 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92661-0 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brain structure and chromosomes ===

LeVay's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the [[INAH 3]] nucleus of the anterior [[hypothalamus]] of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to Money (1988), genetic males with an extra [[Y chromosome]] are more likely to be bisexual, [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] and impulsive.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

=== Evolutionary theory ===

Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt;

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295|title=The evolution of homosexuality: Gender bending - The Economist|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them" and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zietsch | first1 = B. | last2 = Morley | first2 = K. | last3 = Shekar | first3 = S. | last4 = Verweij | first4 = K. | last5 = Keller | first5 = M. | last6 = Macgregor | first6 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 424–433 | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002 | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Wright | first7 = M | last8 = Bailey | first8 = J | last9 = Martin | first9 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Scientific American Mind]]'', the scientist Emily V. Driscoll stated that homosexual and bisexual behavior is quite common in several species and that it fosters bonding: "The more homosexuality, the more peaceful the species". The article also stated: "Unlike most humans, however, individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight: an animal that engages in a same-sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters. Rather, many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society. That is, there are probably no strictly gay critters, just bisexual ones. Animals don't do sexual identity. They just do sex."&lt;ref name="Unorthodox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |title=Bisexual Species: Unorthodox Sex in the Animal Kingdom |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125201624/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |archivedate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masculinization ===

[[Masculinization]] of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

In a research comparison, published in the ''Journal of the Association for Research in [[Otolaryngology]]'', women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential within a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =  McFadden| first =  D.| author2 = Champlin, CA| title = Comparison of auditory evoked potentials in heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual males and females| journal = JARO&amp;nbsp;– Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 89–99| date = March 2000| url =  http://www.springerlink.com/content/qjl332876123011m/| doi = 10.1007/s101620010008| accessdate = 19 June 2008| pmc = 2504562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal hormones ===

The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) and exposure to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]s are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Veniegas/&gt;

There is research evidence that the digit [[ratio]] of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.&lt;ref name=pmid11053694&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00052-0 |pmid=11053694 |title=The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length and male homosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=333–345 |year=2000 |last1=Robinson |first1=S |last2=Manning |first2=J. T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore, the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.&lt;ref name=Muscarella/&gt;

=== Sex drive ===
Several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women. They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were happier than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.&lt;ref name=VanWyk/&gt;

Research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R.

==Community==
{{main|Bisexual community}}

===General social impacts===

The bisexual community (also known as the bisexual/pansexual, bi/pan/fluid, or non-monosexual community) includes members of the [[LGBT community]] who identify as bisexual, pansexual or fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-are-all-somewhere-between-straight.html|title=We are all somewhere between straight and gay|last=Estraven|date=20 April 2009|publisher=[[BiNet USA]] News and Opinions|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the gay or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out. Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners&lt;ref name="newgen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |title=A new generation of issues for LGBT clients |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=DeAngelis, Tori |date=February 2002  |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt; These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.&lt;ref name="newgen"/&gt;

Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same-sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual. The majority of such men&amp;nbsp;— said to be ''living on the [[down-low (MSM)|down-low]]''&amp;nbsp;— do not self-identify as bisexual.&lt;ref name="boykin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |title=10 Things You Should Know About the DL |accessdate=23 February 2007 |author=Boykin, Keith |date=3 February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427005112/http://www.keithboykin.com/arch/001311.html |archivedate=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be a cultural misperception closely related to that of other LGBT individuals who hide their actual orientation due to societal pressures, a phenomenon colloquially called ''"being [[closeted]]"''.{{original research inline|date=December 2015}}

In the U.S., a 2013 [[Pew survey]] showed that 28% of bisexuals said that "all or most of the important people in their life are aware that they are LGBT" vs. 77% of gay men and 71% of lesbians. Furthermore, when broken down by gender, only 12% of bisexual men said that they were "out" vs. 33% of bisexual women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Pew Research Center | date = 13 June 2013 | title = A Survey of LGBT Americans: Attitudes, Experiences and Values in Changing Times | url = http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/06/SDT_LGBT-Americans_06-2013.pdf | pages = 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptions and discrimination===
{{main|Biphobia|Bisexual erasure}}

Like people of other LGBT sexualities, bisexuals often face discrimination. In addition to the discrimination associated with [[homophobia]], bisexuals frequently contend with discrimination from gay men, lesbians, and straight society around the word ''bisexual'' and bisexual identity itself.&lt;ref name="Stange"&gt;{{cite book |title = Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn = 1-4129-7685-5|id={{ISBN|9781412976855}}|publisher=Sage Pubns|year=2011|pages=158–161|accessdate=23 June 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA158|author1=Mary Zeiss Stange |author2=Carol K.

Male bisexuality is particularly presumed to be non-existent,&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt; with [[sexual fluidity]] studies adding to the debate. In 2005, researchers Gerulf Rieger, [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]], and [[J. Michael Bailey]] used [[penile plethysmography]] to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to pornography involving only men and pornography involving only women. Participants were recruited via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men. The authors concluded that "in terms of behavior and identity, bisexual men clearly exist", but that male bisexuality had not been shown to exist with respect to arousal or attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rieger G, Chivers ML, Bailey JM |title=Sexual arousal patterns of bisexual men |journal=Psychological science: APS |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=579–84 |year=2005 |pmid=16102058 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion of Bailey that "for men arousal is orientation" was criticized by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) as a simplification which neglects to account for behavior and self-identification.&lt;ref name="FAIR"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times Suggests Bisexuals Are 'Lying.'

===Symbols===
{{Main|LGBT symbols}}
[[File:Bi flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[bisexual pride flag]].]]

A common symbol of the [[bisexual community]] is the [[bisexual pride flag]], which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one – blending the pink and blue – in the middle to represent bisexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=Bi Pride Flag |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Page, Michael |quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi). |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080614/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:bi triangles.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The overlapping triangles]]

Another symbol with a similarly symbolic color scheme is a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles, forming purple or lavender where they intersect. This design is an expansion on the [[pink triangle]], a well-known symbol for the homosexual community.&lt;ref name="lambda symbols"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm |title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements |accessdate=27 February 2007 |date=26 December 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204072030/http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm |archivedate=4 December 2004 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bisexual-moon-symbol.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The double moon]]

Some bisexual individuals object to the use of a pink triangle, as it was the symbol that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s regime use to tag and persecute homosexuals. In response, a double crescent moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles.&lt;ref name="symbol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/lou/sym/sym05.html |title=Gay Symbols: Other Miscellaneous Symbols |accessdate=18 February 2007 |author=Koymasky, Matt |author2=Koymasky Andrej |date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries.&lt;ref name="symbol"/&gt;

Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond, conceptually derived from the intersection of two triangles, pink and blue (respectively), placed overlapping.

=== Within BDSM ===
In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper, he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual [[BDSM]] community. The reasoning behind this is that "coming-out" had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looked back on his study and considered if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on "Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community"—Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B.

=== Within feminism ===
Feminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as reactionary and anti-feminist [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Sue |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Lynne |editor1-last=Harne |editor1-link= |others=Elaine Miller |title=All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism |trans-title=|url= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1996|month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teacher's College Press]]|location= New York City|isbn= 0-807-76285-7 |oclc= 35202923|doi= |id= |page= |pages=75–89 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Bisexuality as Backlash |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism.

Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate."

[[Donna Haraway]] was the inspiration and genesis for [[cyberfeminism]] with her 1985 essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991). Haraway's essay states that the cyborg "has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |title=Donna Haraway - A Cyborg Manifesto |publisher=Egs.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922114218/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''Feminist Essays'' (2017) by Nancy Quinn Collins states that in the opinion of its author this "is wrong because bisexuality is a sexual orientation, a harmless attraction some people simply have, not something they try to have or do in order to create organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.

Ancient Greeks and Romans did not associate sexual relations with binary labels, as modern Western society does. Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual, and may have had wives or other female lovers.

[[Ancient Greek]] religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html|title=Greek Homosexuality |accessdate=17 February 2007 |last=van Dolen |first=Hein}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sparta]]ns thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and [[unit cohesion]], and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt; For example, [[Aristophanes]] calls them ''euryprôktoi'', meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.&lt;ref name="livius"/&gt;

Similarly, in [[ancient Rome]], gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another's man integrity. It was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender ''per se''. Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]''. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
{{Main|Media portrayals of bisexuality}}

Bisexuality tends to be associated with negative media portrayals; references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders. In an article regarding the 2005 film ''Brokeback Mountain'', sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are often depicted negatively:&lt;ref name="Andre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|title=Opinion: Bisexual Cowboys in Love|last=Andre|first=Amy|date=2005-12-16|publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210122058/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|archivedate=10 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love, because these tend to be so few and far between; the most recent example would be 2002's lovely romantic comedy, ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. Most movies with bi characters paint a stereotypical picture.... The bi love interest is usually deceptive (''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''), over-sexed (''[[The Sex Monster|Sex Monster]]''), unfaithful (''[[High Art]]''), and fickle (''[[Three of Hearts (1993 film)|Three of Hearts]]''), and might even be a serial killer, like Sharon Stone in ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. In other words, the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film.|Amy Andre|''American Sexuality Magazine''}}

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, [[sociology|sociologist]] Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men's behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men's similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual man is often described as a ''duplicitous heterosexual'' man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the white bisexual man is often described in pitying language as a ''[[victimized]] homosexual'' man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pitt Jr. | first1 = Richard N. | last2 =  | first2 =  | year = 2006 | title = Downlow Mountain?

In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'', by [[Sidney Drew]].&lt;ref name="glbtq_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |title=&gt;&gt; arts &gt;&gt; Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015093725/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the censorship required by the [[Hays Code]], the word ''bisexual'' could not be mentioned, and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968.&lt;ref name="glbtq_a" /&gt;

Notable and varying portrayals of bisexuality can be found in mainstream movies such as ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[Frida]]'' (2002), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'' (1996), ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' (1990), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' (1998), ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'' (2001), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1993), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971), ''[[Something for Everyone (1970 film)|Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'' (2002), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), and ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (2017).

=== Literature ===
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is an early example of bisexuality in literature. The story, of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's lover [[Vita Sackville-West]]. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels.&lt;ref name="livia"&gt;Livia, Anna (2000). ''Pronoun Envy: Literary Uses of Linguistic Gender.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780195138535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1925 book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] published ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]]. Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900–1903) series.

The main character in [[Patrick White]]'s novel, ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' (1979), is bisexual. Contemporary novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' novels, such as ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters; this "casual approach" to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis' work.&lt;ref name="badboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201006/author-bret-easton-ellis-less-than-zero-sequel-imperial-bedrooms|title=Bret Easton Ellis: Eternal Bad Boy|work=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|last=Gordinier|first=Jeff|date=June 2010|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...]  America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collis |first=Clark |title=Dear Superstar: David Bowie |work=blender.com |publisher=Alpha Media Group Inc |date=August 2002 |accessdate=16 September 2010 |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510103103/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=366 |archivedate=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen singer [[Freddie Mercury]] was also open about his bisexuality, though did not publicly discuss his relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/freddie-mercury-9406228|title=Freddie Mercury|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Jill Sobule]] sang about [[bi-curious|bi-curiosity]] in her song "I Kissed a Girl", with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend along with images of her with a girlfriend. Another [[I Kissed a Girl (Katy Perry song)|song with the same name]] by [[Katy Perry]] also hints at the same theme. Some activists suggest the song merely reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals experimenting and of bisexuality not being a real sexual preference. [[Lady Gaga]] has also stated that she is bisexual,&lt;ref name="RollStone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/27/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-rise-of-lady-gaga |title=Lady Gaga Rolling Stone Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has acknowledged that her song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" is about fantasizing about a woman while being with a man.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|title=Lady Gaga admits bisexuality and explains "Poker Face" to Barbra Walters|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217041020/http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|archivedate=17 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.'

There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then.

Many non-human animal species exhibit bisexual behavior.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"/&gt; Examples of mammals that display such behavior include the [[bonobo]] (formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee), [[orca]], and the [[bottlenose dolphin]].&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bi Species"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milton"/&gt; Examples of birds include some species of gulls and [[Humboldt penguin]]s. Other examples of bisexual behavior occur among fish and [[flatworm]]s.&lt;ref name="Milton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |title=Bisexuality: A Biological Perspective |accessdate=17 February 2007 |author=Diamond, Milton |year=1998 |work=Bisexualities&amp;nbsp;– The Ideology and Practice of Sexual Contact with both Men and Women |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101000138/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |archivedate=1 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many species of animals are involved in the acts of forming sexual and non-sexual relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they pick the same sex. Some of these species are [[gazelle]]s, [[antelope]], [[bison]], and [[sage grouse]].&lt;ref name=Bidstrup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm |title=The Natural Crime Against Nature |accessdate=26 June 2007 |author=Scott Bidstrup |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, animals will choose to engage in sexual activity with different sexes at different times in their lives, and will sometimes engage in sexual activity with different sexes at random. Same-sex sexual activity can also be seasonal in some animals, like male walruses who often engage in same-sex sexual activity with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual sexual activity during breeding season.&lt;ref name=Bidstrup/&gt;

'''''Black Gold''''' is a 2006 documentary film that follows the efforts of an Ethiopian coffee-union manager as he travels the world to obtain a better price for his workers' [[coffee bean]]s. The film was directed and produced by Marc James Francis and Nick Francis from [[Speakit Films]], and co-produced by Christopher Hird. It premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |archivedate=22 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film focuses on the coffee growers of the [[Oromia Region]] of southern and western [[Ethiopia]], the birthplace of coffee. It follows [[Tadesse Meskela]], the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]], as he visits coffee-growing regions in [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] and Oromia (including the Kilenso Mokonisa Cooperative in the [[Bule Hora]] [[woreda]] in the [[Borena Zone]] of the Oromia Region), as well as a coffee processing center, a coffee auction house, and his union's headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. He also travels to England and the United States in an effort to promote Ethiopian coffee by eliminating the numerous middlemen. There is also a scene where coffee farmers pray to God for a higher price, which was filmed at the Negele Gorbitu Cooperative, located near [[Irgachefe]] in the [[Gelana Abaya|Abaya]] woreda of the Borena Zone. The Ethiopian coffee farmers speak about their lives, with one explaining that he is cutting down his coffee plants and planting ''[[khat]]'' (a plant containing [[cathinone]], an [[amphetamine]]-like stimulant) instead, due to the low price he is getting for coffee because of the explosion in the number of coffee farmers across the globe, and the comparatively higher price he can get for ''khat''.

The film also includes footage of the [[New York Board of Trade]], a [[commodity markets|commodity-trading]] floor in New York City, where the "C" international benchmark price of coffee is set each business day based on supply and demand, and explores the effects that these international prices (which by 2006 were at an all-time low) have on Ethiopian coffee growers. Other footage was shot at the first [[Starbucks]] and the [[World Barista Championship]] at the 2005 [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] conference in Seattle; and at a café and the [[Illy]] coffee company in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. These scenes stand in stark contrast to the footage of the impoverished conditions faced by the Ethiopian coffee farmers and their families.

==Production==
In July 2003, Nick Francis  and Marc James Francis travelled to Ethiopia and started making the film. The meeting with Tadesse Meskela, the manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union, was a decisive moment in the production of the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Notes|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/production-notes|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiring passion and determination of Tadesse, along with his continuous efforts to improve the lives of the farmers he represents, made Nick Francis and Marc James Francis decide much further in the production process to centre the film narrative around Tadesse's journey, his character functioning as a guide into the coffee world. The Ethiopian footage was filmed on two occasions (in 2003 and 2005), for six weeks each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portafilter.net/2006/11/podcast-56-black-gold-movie.html |title=Podcast 56 - Black Gold The Movie |publisher=portafilter.net |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first shoot in Ethiopia, the crew flew to Cancun to document the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]], where pivotal decisions that affect Africa's economy and development were being made in setting the trade rules and where the struggle for fairer international trade rules was played out. Unprecedented, that year developing countries refused to be forced into signing agreements that were against their interests, and the WTO talks completely collapsed. After the team's return to the UK, they spent the following months developing a rough cut of ''Black Gold''. During these months, the direction of the film took shape, along with the rest of the necessary shoots meant to develop the thrust of the narrative. In 2005, the team returned to Ethiopia for further shoots.

Although [[Starbucks]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], and [[Nestlé]]—the world's largest sellers of coffee—are mentioned in the film, all five companies declined invitations to be interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; By the end of 2005, the final cut of ''Black Gold'' was done and officially premiered during the 2006‘s edition of Sundance Film Festival.

==Music==
[[Andreas Kapsalis]], whom Marc James Francis and Nick Francis met during the Sundance Documentary Composers Lab, wrote the final soundtrack. In doing so, he used in part Mathew Coldrick's Ethiopian instrumental samples, recorded from Ethiopia. Joe Henson, Kunja Chatterton, and Mathew Herbert also contributed to the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soundtrack|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/soundtrack|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
In the first few weeks after the premiere, the film helped to generate donations approximately up to $25,000. The dilapidated school featured in the film was built.

Tadesse Meskela, the main character in ''Black Gold'', was able to increase the market price for his cooperative union's coffee. Tadesse Meskela was invited to 10 Downing Street, where he took his message directly to [[Tony Blair]].

After seeing the film, the UN have invited Tadesse to New York to do a presentation about his co-operatives at the 46th Session of the [[Commission for Social Development]].

''Black Gold'' was screened at the [[World Bank]] and [[European Union]], as part of debates about trade policy and development. The Ethiopian ambassadors based at Berlin, Washington, D.C., and London attended screenings.

''Black Gold'' was the first film to receive funding from BritDoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kopp|first=Ingrid|title=Your Film Can Change the World|url=http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203173950/http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 December 2010|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Chris|title=Black Gold: storm in a coffee cup|url=http://www.screendaily.com/black-gold-storm-in-a-coffee-cup/4033053.article#|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate response to ''Black Gold''==
Since the first showing of ''Black Gold'' during Sundance, Starbucks sent people to screenings of the film in what has been called by one journalist "going on a charm offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carnevale|first=Rob|title=Black Gold - Marc and Nick Francis interview|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/black-gold-marc-and-nick-francis-interview|publisher=indielondon.co.uk|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seager|first=Ashley|title=Starbucks stirred by fair trade film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/29/development.filmnews|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the film became more and more popular, Starbucks flew Tadesse and four other African coffee producers to their Seattle headquarters for a weekend conference, which was seen by many as a PR stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian coffee farmer Tadesse Meskela Gudeta tastes Indonesian coffee Thursday at Starbucks' African Coffee Celebration|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/photo/Ethiopian-coffee-farmer-Tadesse-Meskela-Gudeta-904004.php|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siel|title=Black Gold: A Coffee Film That Has Starbucks Scared|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/black-gold-a-coffee-film-that-has-starbucks-scared.html|publisher=treehugger.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, just before the film premiered at the London Film Festival in October 2006, a memo received by Starbucks staff from the headquarters leaked to the ''Black Gold forum''. The internal memo was sent out to inform all Starbucks employees that ''Black Gold'' was "incomplete and inaccurate".&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation''' ('''CSIRO''') is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] agency responsible for scientific research. Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the community. 

CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world. From its headquarters in Canberra, CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States, employing about 5500 people.

Federally funded scientific research began in Australia {{age|1916|6|1}} years ago. The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance.  In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding. CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. In 1949 further legislated changes included re-naming the organisation as CSIRO.

Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], essential components of [[Wi-Fi]] technology, development of the first commercially successful [[polymer banknote]], the invention of the insect repellent in [[Aerogard]] and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia, such as the introduction of [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]] for the control of [[European rabbit|rabbit]] populations.

== Structure ==
CSIRO is governed by a board appointed by the Australian Government, currently chaired by [[David Thodey]]{{post-nominals|country=AUS|A0}}. There are nine directors inclusive of the Chief Executive, presently Dr. [[Larry R. Marshall|Larry Marshall]], who is responsible for management of the organisation.

== Research and focus areas ==
CSIRO is structured into research focus areas, services and infrastructure.

== History ==
===Evolution of the organisation===
A precursor to CSIRO, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, was established in 1916 on the initiative of prime minister [[Billy Hughes]]. However, the Advisory Council struggled with insufficient funding during the First World War. In 1920 the Council was renamed the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and was led by [[George Handley Knibbs]] (1921–26), but continued to struggle financially.

In 1926 the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] modified the principal Act for national scientific research (the ''Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 22 |date= 14 September 1920 |url= http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/iosaia1920221920384.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by passing ''The Science and Industry Research Act 1926''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 20 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= http://www5.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/saira1926201926306.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Act replaced the Institute with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). With encouragement from prime minister [[Stanley Bruce]], strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding, CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. The council was structured to represent the federal structure of government in Australia, and had state-level committees and a central council. In addition to an improved structure, CSIR benefited from strong bureaucratic management under [[George Julius]], [[David Rivett]], and Arnold Richardson. Research focused on primary and secondary industries. Early in its existence, CSIR established divisions studying animal health and animal nutrition. After the [[Great Depression]], research was extended into manufacturing and other secondary industries.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/our-history/ |title= Our history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 the Act was changed again&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1949 |number= 13 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00352/Download |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entity name amended to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The amendment enlarged and reconstituted the organisation and its administrative structure. Under [[Ian Clunies Ross]] as chairman, CSIRO pursued new areas such as radio astronomy and industrial chemistry. CSIRO still operates under the provisions of the 1949 Act in a wide range of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

Since 1949 CSIRO has expanded its activities to almost every field of primary, secondary and tertiary industry, including the environment, human nutrition, conservation, urban and rural planning, and water.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; It works with leading organisations around the world and maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States of America, employing about 5500 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csiro.au/en/About/International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/International |title=International collaboration – CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-01-28 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic research===
CSIRO had a pioneering role in the scientific discovery of the universe through radio "eyes". A team led by [[Paul Wild (Australian scientist)|Paul Wild]] built and operated (from 1948) the world’s first solar radiospectrograph, and from 1967 the {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} radioheliograph at Culgoora in New South Wales. For three decades, the Division of Radiophysics had a world-leading role in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |title=Dr John Paul Wild |publisher=CSIRO |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125053338/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO owned the first computer in Australia, [[CSIRAC]], built as part of a project began in the Sydney Radiophysics Laboratory in 1947. The CSIR Mk 1 ran its first program in 1949, the fifth electronic computer in the world. It was over 1,000 times faster than the mechanical calculators available at the time. It was decommissioned in 1955 and recommissioned in Melbourne as CSIRAC in 1956 as a general purpose computing machine used by over 700 projects until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |title=CSIRAC |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |work=Department of Computer Science and Engineering |accessdate=2006-05-08 |author1=Steven Pass |author2=David Hornsby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227165717/http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRAC is the only surviving first-generation computer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/csirac/ |title=Museum Victoria's CSIRAC information site|accessdate=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965 and 1985, [[George Bornemissza]] of CSIRO's Division of Entomology founded and led the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]]. Bornemissza, upon settling in Australia from Hungary in 1951, noticed that the pastureland was covered in dry cattle dung pads which did not seem to be recycled into the soil and caused areas of rank pasture which were unpalatable to the cattle. He proposed that the reason for this was that native Australian dung beetles, which had co-evolved alongside the marsupials (which produce dung very different in its composition from cattle), were not adapted to utilise cattle dung for their nutrition and breeding since cattle had only relatively recently been introduced to the continent in the 1880s. The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures. Twenty-three species were successfully introduced throughout the duration of the project and also had the effect of reducing the pestilent bush fly population by 90%.&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bornemissza G. F. | year = 1976 | title = The Australian dung beetle project 1965–1975 | url = | journal = Australian Meat Research Committee Review | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Missylisa153, August 2009---&gt;

===Domain name===
CSIRO was the first Australian organisation to start using the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |title=AARNET – About Us – History |publisher=[[Australian Academic and Research Network]] |accessdate=16 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412054848/https://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to register the [[second-level domain]] csiro.au (as opposed to csiro.org.au or csiro.com.au).  Guidelines were introduced in 1996 to regulate the use of the [[.au]] domain.

When CSIR was formed in 1926, it was led initially by an Executive Committee of three people, two of whom were designated as the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Since then the roles and responsibilities of the Chair and Chief Executive have changed many times. From 1927 to 1986 the head of CSIR (and from 1949, CSIRO)&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; was the Chairman, who was responsible for the management of the organisation, supported by the Chief Executive. From 1 July 1959 to 4 December 1986 CSIRO had no Chief Executive; the Chairman undertook both functions.&lt;ref name="heads"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/heads-of-csiro-2/ |title= Chief Executives and Chairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when the [[Hawke Government|Australian Government]] changed the structure of CSIRO to include a board of non-executive members plus the Chief Executive to lead CSIRO, the roles changed. The Chief Executive is now responsible for management of the organisation in accordance with the strategy, plans and policies approved by the CSIRO Board which, led by the Chair of the Board, is responsible to the Australian Government for the overall strategy, governance and performance of CSIRO.&lt;ref name="heads"/&gt;

As with its governance structure, the priorities and structure of CSIRO, and the teams and facilities that implement its research, have changed as Australia's scientific challenges have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/organisational-history/ |title= Organisational history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Total Wellbeing Diet===
In 2005 the CSIRO gained worldwide attention, including some criticism, for promoting a high-[[protein]], low-[[carbohydrate]] diet of their own creation called ''[[Total Wellbeing Diet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Health-and-Wellbeing/Prevention/Total-Wellbeing-Diet-online.aspx |title=CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet online - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRO published the diet in a book which sold over half a million copies in Australia and over 100,000 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-24 |title=The town taking the CSIRO challenge |work=[[A Current Affair (Australian TV program)|A Current Affair]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213020826/http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet was criticised in an editorial by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' for giving scientific credence to a "fashionable" diet sponsored by meat and dairy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/peers-turn-up-heat-on-csiro-diet/2005/12/27/1135445573297.html |title=Peers turn up heat on CSIRO diet |publisher=The Age |date=28 December 2005 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classicbackissues.australasianscience.com.au/bi2006/272CSIROdiet.pdf |title=Nature Gags on CSIRO Diet |publisher=Australasian Science |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===802.11 patent===
In the early 1990s, CSIRO radio astronomy scientists John O'Sullivan, Graham Daniels, Terence Percival, Diethelm Ostry and John Deane undertook research directed to finding a way to make wireless networks work as fast as wired networks within confined spaces such as office buildings. The technique they developed, involving a particular combination of [[forward error correction]], frequency-domain interleaving, and [[multi-carrier modulation]], became the subject of {{US Patent|5487069}}, which was granted on 23 January 1996.

In 1997 Macquarie University professor David Skellern and his colleague Neil Weste established the company Radiata, Inc., which took a nonexclusive licence to the CSIRO patent for the purpose of developing commercially viable integrated circuit devices implementing the patented technology.&lt;ref name=Radiata&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Mark |title=Creating and Exploiting Intangible Networks: How Radiata was able to improve its odds of success in the risky process of innovating |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/3C2255E6-B6E5-49EB-BB96-1FBA94EB0EA4/1372/radiata.pdf |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Education, Science and Training |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author2=Bob Frater |pages=8–9 &amp; 16 |format=PDF |date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the [[IEEE 802.11]] Working Group was developing the 802.11a wireless LAN standard. CSIRO did not participate directly in the standards process, however David Skellern was an active participant as secretary of the Working Group, and representative of Radiata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skellern |first=David |title=Tentative Minutes of the IEEE P802.11 Full Working Group |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Minutes/Cons_Minutes_99July.pdf |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=5–9 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 it became apparent that the CSIRO patent would be pertinent to the standard. In response to a request from Victor Hayes of Lucent Technologies, who was Chair of the 802.11 Working Group, CSIRO confirmed its commitment to make non-exclusive licenses available to implementers of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Dennis |title=Letter to Mr V Hayes, Chair, IEEE P802.11 |url=http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/loa-802_11a-csiro-04Dec1998.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=4 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Cisco Systems]], Inc. and [[Broadcom]] Corporation each invested A$4&amp;nbsp;million in Radiata, representing an 11% stake for each investor and valuing the company at around A$36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt; In September 2000, Radiata demonstrated a chip set complying with the recently finalised IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi standard, and capable of handling transmission rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, at a major international exhibition.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt;

In November 2000, Cisco acquired Radiata in exchange for US$295&amp;nbsp;million in Cisco common stock with the intention of incorporating the Radiata Baseband Processor and Radio chips into its Aironet family of wireless LAN products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release: Cisco Systems to Acquire Radiata, Inc. |url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc. |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124055012/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |archivedate=24 November 2001 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cisco subsequently took a large write-down on the Radiata acquisition, following the 2001 [[telecoms crash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heskett |first=Ben |title=Cisco still confident after networking shock |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/cisco-still-confident-after-networking-shock/119211 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 it shut down its internal development of wireless chipsets based on the Radiata technology in order to focus on software development and emerging new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |title=Cisco retires wireless chipsets |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033_3-5151131.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CNET News |date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the CSIRO patent arose in 2006 after the organisation won an injunction against [[Buffalo Technology]] in an infringement suit filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO wins landmark legal battle |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/wireless--broadband/csiro-wins-landmark-legal-battle/2006/11/15/1163266614119.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Age |date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction was subsequently suspended on appeal, with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding that the judge in Texas should have allowed a trial to proceed on Buffalo’s challenge to the validity of the CSIRO patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Venkatesan |first=Arun |title=Buffalo Allowed to sell wireless products again (for now) |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/03/buffalo-allowed-to-sell-wireless-products-again-for-now/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechCrunch |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CSIRO declined to provide an assurance to the IEEE that it would not sue companies which refused to take a license for use in 802.11n-compliant devices, while at the same time continuing to defend legal challenges to the validity of the patent brought by [[Intel]], [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Netgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winterford |first=Brett |title=No backdown from CSIRO over Wi-Fi patents |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2007/10/02/no-backdown-from-csiro-over-wi-fi-patents-39289756/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Hewlett-Packard broke ranks with the rest of the industry becoming the first to reach a settlement of its dispute with CSIRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO cashes in on patent claim |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/csiro-cashes-in-on-patent-claim/2009/04/01/1238261630683.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was followed quickly by settlements with Microsoft, [[Fujitsu]] and [[Asus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duckett |first=Chris |title=Microsoft, Fujitsu, Asus settle with CSIRO |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/microsoft-fujitsu-asus-settle-with-csiro-339295967.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Dell, Intel, [[Nintendo]], [[Toshiba]], Netgear, Buffalo, [[D-Link]], [[Belkin]], [[SMC Networks|SMC]], [[Accton]], and [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent lawsuits conclude with the final 13 companies set |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/22/csiros-patent-lawsuits-conclude-with-the-final-13-companies-set/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=David |title=CSIRO could scoop billions from Wi-Fi patent |url=http://apcmag.com/csiro-could-scoop-billions-from-wi-fi-patent.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=APC Magazine |date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy grew after CSIRO sued US carriers [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon]] and [[T-Mobile]] in 2010, with the organisation being accused of being "Australia's biggest patent troll", a wrathful "patent bully", and of imposing a "WiFi tax" on American innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Popper |first=Ben |title=Australia's Biggest Patent Troll Goes After AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-43340647/australias-biggest-patent-troll-goes-after-at038t-verizon-and-t-mobile/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CBS News |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent fight targets more victims: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/21/csiros-patent-fight-targets-more-victims-atandt-verizon-wireles/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=CSIRO Wants To Expand Its WiFi Tax: Sues Mobile Operators |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1913309652.shtml |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechDirt |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further fuel was added to the controversy after a settlement with the carriers, worth around $229&amp;nbsp;million, was announced in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=Champagne at CSIRO after WiFi patent settlement |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/01/csiro_settles_with_carriers/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=WiFi patent case results in $229 million payment to Australian government |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/wifi-patent-case-results-in-229m-payment-to-australian-government/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged in part by an announcement by the Australian Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Media Release: Aussie scientists bring home millions in wifi windfall |url=http://minister.innovation.gov.au/chrisevans/MediaReleases/Pages/millionsinwifiwindfall.aspx |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article in [[Ars Technica]] portrayed CSIRO as a shadowy organisation responsible for US consumers being compelled to make "a multimillion dollar donation" on the basis of a questionable patent claiming "decades old" technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=How the Aussie government "invented WiFi" and sued its way to $430 million |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/how-the-aussie-government-invented-wifi-and-sued-its-way-to-430-million/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting debate became so heated that the author was compelled to follow up with a defence of the original article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=Responses and clarifications on the CSIRO patent lawsuits |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/op-ed/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view was also published on [[The Register]], challenging a number of the assertions made in the Ars Technica piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=CSIRO patent-trolls ALL OF AMERICA! |date=10 April 2012|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/10/csiro_patent_trolls_wifi/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total income to CSIRO from the patent is currently estimated at nearly $430&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSIRO wins legal battle over wi-fi patent |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-01/csiro-receives-payment-for-wifi-technology/3925814 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ABC News |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 14 June 2012, the CSIRO inventors received the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO) [[European Inventor Award]] (EIA), in the category of "Non-European Countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPO's European Inventor Award 2012 goes to outstanding inventors from Germany, France, Denmark and Australia

===Genetically modified wheat trials===
On 14 July 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists vandalised a crop of GM wheat, circumventing the scientific trials being undertaken. Greenpeace was forced to pay reparations to CSIRO of $280,000 for the criminal damage, and were accused by the sentencing judge, Justice Hilary Penfold, of cynically using junior members of the organisation with good standing to avoid custodial sentences, while the offenders were given 9-month suspended sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/greenpeace-activists-in-costly-gm-protest-20120802-23i0t.html| title=Greenpeace activists in costly GM protest| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| date=2012-08-02| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/gm-crop-destroyers-given-suspended-sentences-20121119-29l66.html| title=GM crop destroyers given suspended sentences| publisher=Canberra Times| date=2012-11-19| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack Greenpeace criticised CSIRO for a close relationship with industry that had led to an increase in [[genetically modified crops]], even though a core aim of CSIRO is Cooperative Research "working hand in hand with industry [to] build partnerships and engage with industry to generate impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Partner/Industry.aspx | title = Working hand in hand with industry | accessdate = 8 Nov 2013 | date = 22 April 2013 | work = CSIRO website | publisher = Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/en/mediacentre/media-releases/food/Greenpeace-calls-on-CSIRO-to-come-clean-on-commercial-relationships/ |title= Greenpeace calls on CSIRO to come clean on commercial relationships |date= 15 July 2011 |publisher= www.greenpeace.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change censorship: Clive Spash ===
On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-2-The-Australian-FRONT-PAGE.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 2 November 2009 |title= CSIRO bid to gag emissions trading scheme policy attack |work= The Australian |publisher= News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, [[Megan Clark]], which attacked the report's author and threatened him with unspecified punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9_News_26_Nov_2009.pdf |author= Crystal, J. |date= 26 November 2009 |title= CSIRO scientist faces punishment |publisher= 9 News |location= Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Climate expert Clive Spash 'heavied' by CSIRO management |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-3-The_Australian-Climate_expert_Clive_Spash_heavied_by_CSIRO_management.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 3 November 2009 |work= The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later gave a radio interview about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MW-CSIRO-121212.mp3 |author= Walsh, M. |year= 2012 |title= The toxic workplace and bullying culture at CSIRO |publisher= www.2cc.net.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be "tiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091113/full/news.2009.1083.html |author= Pincock, S. |date=13 November 2009 |title= Australian agency moves to calm climate row. Researcher will be allowed to publish his paper after making 'tiny' changes. |journal= Nature |doi=10.1038/news.2009.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spash claimed the changes actually demanded amounted to censorship and resigned. He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An Orwellian guide to carbon emissions trading |author= Spash, C. |year= 2010 |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OrwellianGuidetoCarbonETS.pdf |publisher= www.clivespash.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Senate 2010. Senate Economics Legislation Committee Estimates. Canberra: Official Hansard (Wednesday, 10 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, [[New Political Economy (journal)|New Political Economy]], which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an 'A class' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/era2010_journal_title_list.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119133137/http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/ERA2010_journal_title_list.xls |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dumped Professor calls for Senate inquiry |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2829301.htm |author= Colvin, M. |year= 2010 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these events, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''  reported that "Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.smh.com.au/business/csiro-in-bed-with-big-coal-20100702-zu2i.html |author= Manning, P. |year= 2010 |title= CSIRO in bed with big coal |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/ |author= Spash, C.

===CSIRO–Novartis–DataTrace scandal===
On 11 April 2013, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' ran a story on how CSIRO had "duped" the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant [[Novartis]] into purchasing an anti-counterfeit technology for its vials of injectable [[Voltaren]]. The invention was marketed by a small Australian company called DataTrace DNA as a method of identifying fake vials, on the basis that a unique tracer code developed by CSIRO was embedded in the product. However, the code sold to Novartis for more than A$2M was apparently not unique, and was based on a "cheap tracer ... bought in bulk from a Chinese distributor". Novartis was contractually bound not to reverse-engineer the tracer to verify its uniqueness. The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report alleges that this was done with the knowledge of key CSIRO personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the CSIRO cheated a global drugs giant |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-csiro-cheated-a-global-drugs-giant-20130410-2hluf.html |accessdate=12 April 2012 |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO has since conducted a full review of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Media/CSIRO-review-of-issues-raised-about-CSIROs-interactions-with-DataTrace.aspx |title=CSIRO review of issues raised about CSIRO’s interactions with DataTrace |publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged bullying, harassment and victimisation===
In recent years{{When|date=February 2017}} the CSIRO has fallen under the spotlight for allegedly exhibiting a culture of workplace bullying and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser and Nicky Phillips (12 April 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/science-second-in-toxic-csiro-work-culture-20130412-2hqv0.html "Science second in toxic CSIRO work culture"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former CSIRO employees started to surface with experiences of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (5 February 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/probe-into-csiro-bullying-20130205-2dwva.html "Probe into CSIRO bullying"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (18 September 2012) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/whistleblowers-at-csiro-forced-out-and-bullying-rife-20120917-262hk.html "Whistleblowers at CSIRO forced out and bullying rife"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; CSIRO took the allegations seriously and responded to the articles on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (14 April 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/More-than-85-years-growth-change-impact.aspx "More than 85 years of growth, change and impact"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (2 May 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Chief-Executive-Megan-Clarks-update-to-staff-re-Fairfax-articles.aspx "Chief Executive Megan Clark's update to staff re Fairfax articles"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, [[Sophie Mirabella]], wrote to the government requesting it establish an inquiry. Mirabella said she is aware of as many as 100 cases of alleged workplace harassment. On 20 July 2012 [[Comcare]] issued CSIRO with an Improvement Notice with regard to handling and management of workplace misconduct/code of conduct type investigations and allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130727093429/http://www.comcare.gov.au/about_us/access_to_information/disclosure_log/foi_requested_documents/improvement_notice_relating_to_eve207221 ]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2013 Mirabella advised the [[Australian House of Representatives]] that in relation to the worker's compensation claim for psychological injuries of ex-CSIRO employee, Martin Williams, which was vigorously defended by [[Comcare]] on the advice of the CSIRO, that CSIRO officers had provided false testimony on no less than 128 occasions under oath when the matter went before the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;''"I am also reminded of the government's stubborn unwillingness to bring the CSIRO to account for a series of inaccurate and misleading statements that have been made to the Senate estimates committees, including the recent incomprehensible answer to question AL156 which says that no CSIRO employee provided false evidence under oath during cross-examination in the AAT case involving Martin Williams, when an analysis of the transcript of that case suggests that there are at least 100, and more precisely around 128, separate instances of CSIRO officers providing false evidence in the case."''
Sophie Mirabella MP (shadow minister for innovation, industry, science research and tertiary education). Australian House of Representatives – House Debate Monday 24 June 2013 at 6:33pm. [http://www.openaustralia.org/debate/?id=2013-06-24.99.2 "Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2013; Second Reading"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirabella stated, "even in establishing the framework for this inquiry it is obvious there's an inappropriate 'hands on' approach by CSIRO."

In response to the allegations Clark commissioned Dennis Pearce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/expertise/intellectual-property-and-trade-marks/features/our-team/item/479-emeritus-professor-dennis-pearce-ao.html |title=Emeritus Prof. Dennis Pearce AO FAAL |website=Hwlebsworth.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is assisted by an investigation team from HWL Ebsworth Lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWL Ebsworth appointed to CSIRO bullying enquiry|url=http://asia.legalbusinessonline.com/news/hwl-ebsworth-appointed-to-csiro-bullying-enquiry/110241|work=Asian Legal Business|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html Independent Investigator for Allegations of Workplace Bullying and Other Unreasonable Behaviour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409032401/http://hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html |date=9 April 2013 }}, hwlebsworth.com.au&lt;br/&gt;

===CSIRO and the Liberal Government===
In August 2015 the CSIRO discontinued its annual July and August survey, conducted over the previous five years, polling to create a long-term view of how Australians viewed global warming and their support for action.  In the previous 2013 poll, 86 per cent agreed with the statement that climate change was occurring and only 7.6 per cent disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-change-csiro-axes-annual-attitudes-survey-delays-2014-results-20150810-giw6i1.html |title=Climate change: CSIRO axes annual attitudes survey, delays 2014 results |website=Smh.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 11th February 2016, Dr Larry Marshall – a former venture capitalist with Southern Cross Venture Holdings, who had been appointed CEO of the CSIRO on the 1st January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Leadership-governance/Chief-Executive-and-Executive-Team/Team |title=Executive Team - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2015-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused an international outcry after describing Australia’s national climate change discussion as “more like religion than science,” a week after announcing hundreds of job cuts to the organisation that will reduce the effectiveness of its climate research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/climate-politics-more-like-religion-says-csiro-boss-90059 |title=Climate politics 'more like religion', says CSIRO boss |publisher=Renew Economy |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “an open letter to the Australian Government and CSIRO”, 2,800 of the leading climate scientists from 60 countries say the announcement of cuts to the CSIRO’s Oceans and Atmosphere research program has alarmed the global climate research community.  They say the decision shows a lack of insight and a misunderstanding of the importance of the depth and significance of Australian contributions to global and regional climate research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-top-scientists-beg-malcolm-turnbull-to-allow-csiro-to-continue-its-climate-research-2016-2 |title=The world's top scientists beg Malcolm Turnbull to allow CSIRO to continue its climate research |website=Businessinsider.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">'''Computational social science''' refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the [[social science]]s. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena.  Fields include [[computational economics]], [[computational sociology]], [[cliodynamics]], [[culturomics]],  and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through [[social simulation]], modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computationalsocialscience.org/|title=The Computational Social Science Society of the Americas official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two terminologies that relate to each other: '''Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS)'''. In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.
On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.

Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the [[scientific method]]: [[empirical research]], especially through [[big data]], by analyzing the [[digital footprint]] left behind through social online activities; and [[scientific theory]], especially through [[computer simulation]] model building through [[social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;DT&amp;SC 7-1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3d75ZMuYU .

[[File:Drei Frauen am Pranger, China, Anonym, um 1875.jpg|thumb|right|Three women in the [[pillory]], [[Ching China|China]], 1875]]
'''Criminology''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|crīmen}}, "accusation" originally derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] verb "krino" "κρίνω", and Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''-logy|-logia'', from "logos" meaning: “word,” “reason,” or “plan”) is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of the nature, extent, management, causes, control, consequences, and prevention of [[criminal behavior]], both on individual and social levels. Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[social science]]s, drawing especially upon the research of [[sociology|sociologists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]], as well as scholars of law.

The term ''criminology'' was coined in 1885 by Italian law professor [[Raffaele Garofalo]] as ''[[:it:Criminologia|criminologia]].'' Later, French anthropologist [[Paul Topinard]] used the analogous French term ''[[:fr:Criminologie|criminologie]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociological Theory and Criminological Research: Views from Europe and the United States |page=279 |editor=Deflem, Mathieu |isbn=978-0-7623-1322-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States for the past 100 years, criminology has experienced three life course phases : (1) Golden Age of Research (1900-1930) which has been described as multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960) which shows that they were no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and 1960-2000 period as seen as a significant turning point for criminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=J.|date=2000-03-01|title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article-abstract/40/2/222/611103?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=British Journal of Criminology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222|issn=0007-0955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminological Schools of thought==
In the mid-18th century, criminology arose as [[social philosophy|social philosophers]] gave thought to crime and concepts of law. Over time, several schools of thought have developed. There were three main schools of thought in early criminological theory spanning the period from the mid-18th century to the mid-twentieth century: [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical]], [[Positivist school (criminology)|Positivist]], and [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago]]. These schools of thought were superseded by several contemporary paradigms of criminology, such as the sub-culture, control, strain, labeling, [[critical criminology]], [[cultural criminology]], [[Postmodernist school (criminology)|postmodern criminology]], [[Feminist school of criminology|feminist criminology]] and others discussed below.

===Classical school===
{{POV|date=January 2013}}
The [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical school]] arose in the mid-18th century and has its basis in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosophy. [[Cesare Beccaria]],&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"&gt;{{cite book |author=Beccaria, Cesare |title=On Crimes and Punishments, and Other Writings |year=1764 |page=64 |translator=Richard Davies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40203-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene|On Crimes and Punishments]]'' (1763–64), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (inventor of the ''[[panopticon]]''), and other philosophers in this school argued:{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
# People have [[free will]] to choose how to act.
# The basis for deterrence is the idea humans are '[[Hedonism|hedonists]]' who seek pleasure and avoid pain, and 'rational calculators' who weigh the costs and benefits of every action. It ignores the possibility of [[irrationality]] and unconscious drives as motivators.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
# [[Punishment]] (of sufficient severity) can deter people from crime, as the costs (penalties) outweigh benefits, and severity of punishment should be proportionate to the crime.&lt;ref name="Beccaria, Cesare 1764 64"/&gt;
# The more swift and certain the punishment, the more effective as a deterrent to criminal behavior.
This school developed during a major reform in [[penology]], when society began designing prisons for the sake of extreme punishment. This period also saw many legal reforms, the [[French Revolution]], and the development of the [[Law of the United States|legal system in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Positivist school===
The [[Positivist school]] argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. Philosophers within this school applied the scientific method to study human behavior. Positivism comprises three segments: [[Positivist school (criminology)#Biological positivism|biological]], [[Positivist school (criminology)#Psychological postivism|psychological]] and [[social positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;David, Christian Carsten.

====Italian school====
[[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835–1909), an Italian sociologist working in the late 19th century, is often called "the father of [[criminal anthropology|criminology]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227053359/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5047&amp;context=jclc |archivedate=27 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the key contributors to biological positivism and founded the [[Italian school of criminology]].&lt;ref name="siegel-p7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Siegel, Larry J. |title=Criminology, 8th edition |year=2003 |publisher= Thomson-Wadsworth |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombroso took a scientific approach, insisting on empirical evidence for studying crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crime and Society: Readings in History and Theory |isbn=978-0-415-02755-7 |author1=McLennan, Gregor |author2=Jennie Pawson |author3=Mike Fitzgerald |publisher= Routledge |page=311 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggested physiological traits such as the measurements of cheek bones or hairline, or a cleft palate could indicate "[[atavism|atavistic]]" criminal tendencies. This approach, whose influence came via the theory of [[phrenology]] and by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]], has been superseded. [[Enrico Ferri]], a student of Lombroso, believed social as well as biological factors played a role, and believed criminals should not be held responsible when factors causing their criminality were beyond their control. Criminologists have since rejected Lombroso's biological theories, since [[control group]]s were not used in his studies.&lt;ref name="siegel-p139"&gt;

Strict biological determinism is no longer taken seriously (later in his career even Lombroso recognized that not all criminals were biological throwbacks). Early biological determinism has been discredited because it is methodologically flawed: most studies did not use control groups from the general population to compare results, a violation of the scientific method.

====Sociological positivism====
[[Sociological positivism]] suggests societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of education predispose people to crime. [[Adolphe Quetelet]] used data and statistical analysis to study the relationship between crime and sociological factors. He found age, gender, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption were important factors to crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/228630 |title=Adolphe Quetelet and the Origins of Positivist Criminology |author=Beirne, Piers |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=92 |date=March 1987 |pages=1140–1169 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lance Lochner performed three different research experiments, each one proving education reduces crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lochner|first=Lance|title=The American Economic Review|journal=The Effect of Education on Crime: Evidence from Prison Inmates, Arrests, and Self-Reports|volume=94|pages=155–189|doi=10.1257/000282804322970751|year=2004|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4mf8k11n|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rawson W. Rawson]] used [[crime statistics]] to suggest a link between [[population density]] and [[crime rate]]s, with crowded cities producing more crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hayward, Keith J. |title=City Limits: Crime, Consumerism and the Urban Experience |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-904385-03-5 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Fletcher (statistician)|Joseph Fletcher]] and John Glyde read papers to the [[Statistical Society of London]] on their studies of crime and its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Garland, David |chapter=Of Crimes and Criminals |page=21 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminology, 3rd edition |editor=Maguire, Mike |editor2=Rod Morgan |editor3=Robert Reiner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Mayhew]] used [[empirical]] methods and an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach to address social questions and poverty, and gave his studies in ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25 |title=Henry Mayhew: London Labour and the London Poor |publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160854/http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/25/ |archivedate=15 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] viewed crime as an inevitable aspect of a society with uneven distribution of wealth and other differences among people.

====Differential association (subcultural)====
People learn crime through [[Differential association|association]]. This theory was advocated by [[Edwin Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deviance: A Symbolic Interactionist Approach|last=Herman|first=Nancy|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1995|isbn=978-1882289387|location=Michigan|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acts may condone criminal conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances. Interacting with [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] peers is a major cause. Reinforcing criminal behavior makes it chronic. Where there are criminal [[subcultures]], many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ferracuti|title=Criminological Theory Summaries|url=http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|publisher=Cullen &amp; Agnew|accessdate=3 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131020192418/http://www.uwec.edu/patchinj/crmj301/theorysummaries.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago school===
The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] arose in the early twentieth century, through the work of [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]], and other [[urban sociology|urban sociologists]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  In the 1920s, Park and Burgess identified five [[Concentric ring model|concentric zones]] that often exist as cities grow, including the "[[zone of transition]]", which was identified as the most volatile and subject to disorder.  In the 1940s, [[Harry McKay|Henry McKay]] and Clifford R. Shaw focused on [[juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]], finding that they were concentrated in the zone of transition.

Chicago school sociologists adopted a [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] approach to studying cities and postulated that urban neighborhoods with high levels of poverty often experience breakdown in the [[social structure]] and [[institution]]s such as family and schools.  This results in [[social disorganization]], which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]].

Other researchers suggested an added social-psychological link.  [[Edwin Sutherland]] suggested that people learn criminal behavior from older, more experienced criminals with whom they may associate.

Theoretical perspectives used in criminology include [[psychoanalysis]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[interactionism]], [[Marxism]], [[econometrics]], [[systems theory]], [[postmodernism]], [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], etc.

===Social structure theories===
This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a [[conflict theory]] or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime. As this perspective is itself broad enough, embracing as it does a diversity of positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, S., Eglin, P. 1992, ''A Sociology of Crime'', London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social disorganization (neighborhoods)====
[[Social disorganization theory]] is based on the work of Henry McKay and Clifford R. Shaw of the Chicago School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shaw, Clifford R.  |author2=McKay, Henry D. |title=Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1942 |isbn=978-0-226-75125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social disorganization theory postulates that neighborhoods plagued with poverty and economic deprivation tend to experience high rates of [[population turnover]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Disorganization and Theories of Crime and Delinquency: Problems and Prospects |author1=Bursik Jr. |author2=Robert J. |journal=Criminology |year=1988 |volume=26 |pages=519–539 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1988.tb00854.x |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that crime and deviance is valued within groups in society, ‘subcultures’ or ‘gangs’. These groups have different values to the [[social norm]]. These neighborhoods also tend to have high population [[Heterogeneous|heterogeneity]].&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt; With high turnover, informal [[social structure]] often fails to develop, which in turn makes it difficult to maintain [[social order]] in a community.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.  Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration.&lt;ref name="bursik-1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morenoff, Jeffrey |author2=Robert Sampson |author3=Stephen Raudenbush |title=Neighborhood Inequality, Collective Efficacy and the Spatial Dynamics of Urban Violence |journal=Criminology |volume=39 |year=2001 |pages=517–60 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2001.tb00932.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[working class|working]] and [[Middle class|middle-class]] people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. [[William Julius Wilson]] suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Larry|title=Criminology: Theories, Patterns, and Typologies|date=2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1305446090|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strain theory (social strain theory)====
{{Main|Strain theory (sociology)}}
Strain theory, also known as Mertonian Anomie, advanced by American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]], suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the ''[[American Dream]]''. Most people buy into this dream, and it becomes a powerful cultural and psychological motivator. Merton also used the term ''[[anomie]]'', but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]].  Merton saw the term as meaning a [[dichotomy]] between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve.  Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into [[deviance (sociology)|deviant]] subcultures (such as [[Gang|gang members]], or what he calls "[[hobo]]s"). [[Robert Agnew (criminologist)|Robert Agnew]] developed this theory further to include types of strain which were not derived from financial constraints. This is known as [[general strain theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merton, Robert |year=1957 |title=Social Theory and Social Structure |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-02-921130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory'''

''Main article: Messner and Institutional Anomie Theory''

The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory stems from a pre-existing theory, discovered by Merton named Strain theory. Rosenberger took his findings and offered a different approach to definition and based it on the assumption that everybody should already have "the assumption that the “American Dream” produces a society that is dominated by the economy and obsessed with the pursuit of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberger|first=Jared|date=October 2016|title=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=a46dc574-3755-410e-8199-998554e3b4a9%40sdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116344296&amp;db=sih|journal=Television consumption and institutional anomie theory|volume= 49|pages=305–325. 21p|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory has many different views and definitions by many people therefore this becomes a very flexible theory.

Larine Hughes found a correlation between economic pressure and how it combines the "American Dream" and "Individualism" to a high crime. Hughes came to  final decision that "Therefore, individuals that do not have the drive to succeed and achieve this “goal”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Lorine|date=2015|title=Economic Dominance, the "American Dream," and Homicide:|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f60096cd-f6eb-4b62-b63c-18b30345ebe9%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100487344&amp;db=sih|journal=A Cross-National Test of Institutional Anomie Theory|volume= 85|pages=p. 100–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will fail, despite social and cultural pressures.

Samantha Applin, then took an approached relating genders and The Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory. Stated in an article by S. Applin, "males make up what is considered “normal subjects”, and due to this, force woman to lie on a boundary that expectation is outside the dominant cultural frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samantha|first=Applin|date=April 2014|title=Her American Dream|url=https://journals-sagepub-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1557085114525654|journal=Bringing Gender Into Institutional-Anomie Theory|volume= 10|pages= 36–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, setting women back in the beginning stages of Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Theory.

Brian Stults began to research studies on the violence between youth and the correlation that it  has on Messner and Rosenfeld Institutional Anomie Theory. Stults found sated " As well as the results showed graduating high school represents an important developmental stage in American society, as it ends the compulsory education, and is often followed by a significant decline in daily need and extra resources from your parents."

====Subcultural theory====
{{Main|Subcultural theory}}
Following the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and strain theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], subcultural theorists focused on small cultural groups [[Fragmentation (sociology)|fragmenting]] away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life.

[[Albert K. Cohen]] tied anomie theory with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[reaction formation]] idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cohen, Albert |title=Delinquent Boys |publisher=Free Press |year=1955 |isbn=978-0-02-905770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include "toughness" and disrespect for authority.  Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kornhauser, R. |year=1978 |title=Social Sources of Delinquency |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-45113-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]] suggested that delinquency can result from a differential opportunity for lower class youth.&lt;ref name="cloward"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cloward, Richard, Lloyd Ohlin |title=Delinquency and Opportunity |publisher=Free Press |year=1960 |isbn=978-0-02-905590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such youths may be tempted to take up criminal activities, choosing an illegitimate path that provides them more lucrative economic benefits than conventional, over legal options such as [[minimum wage]]-paying jobs available to them.&lt;ref name="cloward"/&gt;

British subcultural theorists focused more heavily on the issue of [[Social class|class]], where some criminal activities were seen as "imaginary solutions" to the problem of belonging to a subordinate class. A further study by the Chicago school looked at gangs and the influence of the interaction of gang leaders under the observation of adults.

Sociologists such as [[Raymond Gastil|Raymond D. Gastil]] have explored the impact of a [[Southern culture of honor]] on violent crime rates.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond D. Gastil, "Homicide and a Regional Culture of Violence," American Sociological Review 36 (1971): 412-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control theories====
Another approach is made by the social bond or [[social control theory]]. Instead of looking for factors that make people become criminal, these theories try to explain why people do ''not'' become criminal. [[Travis Hirschi]] identified four main characteristics: "attachment to others", "belief in moral validity of rules", "commitment to achievement", and "involvement in conventional activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-7658-0900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).  On the other hand, if these factors are not present, a person is more likely to become a criminal. Hirschi expanded on this theory with the idea that a person with low [[self control]] is more likely to become criminal. As opposed to most criminology theories, these do not look at why people commit crime but rather why they do not commit crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A General Theory of Crime |author=[[Michael R. Gottfredson|Gottfredson, Michael R.]], [[Travis Hirschi|Hirschi, Travis]] |year=1990 |publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht but does not have the means to buy one.  If the person cannot exert self-control, he or she might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait, deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms.

Social bonds, through [[Peer group|peers]], parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control.  For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children, from those who are not delinquent, is the control exerted by parents or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperonage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson, Harriet |title=Parental Supervision: A Neglected Aspect of Delinquency |year=1980 |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, theorists such as [[David Matza]] and [[Gresham Sykes]] argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social behavioral constraints through [[techniques of neutralization]].

====Psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for punishment====
Psychoanalysis is the system of psychological theory and therapy looking towards the investigation of the conscious and unconscious mind elements, along with repressed memories that can be taken back into consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Broadview Editions|year=2011|isbn=|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his novel, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' which was interpreted by Hubback.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Freud looks into research indicating a ‘repetition compulsion’ and a ‘death drive’ which is the unconscious impulse that one may get to become self-destructive and actually have the ability to take over the creativity drive within someone. Phillida Rosnick, author of the article ''Mental Pain and Social Trauma,'' looks into the mental state of someone who has experienced extreme trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosnick|first=Phillida|date=2017|title=Mental Pain and Social Trauma|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=94(6)|pages=1200–1202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They discovered there is a difference in the actions and thoughts of individuals suffering traumatic unconscious pain and this corresponds to them having thoughts and feelings that are unlike their normal selves. By looking at the unconscious within a paranoid state of mind from trauma, there is a direct correlation to how this behavior can cause criminals to act in deviant ways based on their brain structure and how their unconscious is taking information. Sander Gilman, the author of the article ''Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis'', actually looks into the physical mechanisms of the human brain and the nervous system relating to the impulses that someone might feel and the impulses that might cause someone to unconsciously desire pain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilman|first=Sander|date=2008|title=Freud and the Making of Psychoanalysis|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uindy.edu/docview/199033499?accountid=28917|journal=The Lancet|volume=372|pages=1799–1800|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman speaks to Freud’s position on the various issues of the mind and the potential discovery from looking at the brain and interpreting data about the unconscious mind and the Eros within the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By looking at how psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for pain relate to each other, there is more evidence as to how it can occur within criminals and how these impulses or the innate desires within an individual can ultimately be the cause of deviant acts.

==Social network analysis==
{{main|Social network analysis (criminology)}}

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism draws on the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], as well as [[subcultural theory]] and [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mead, George Herbert |title=Mind Self and Society |year=1934 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This school of thought focused on the relationship between state, media, and conservative-ruling elite and other less powerful groups. The powerful groups had the ability to become the "significant other" in the less powerful groups' processes of generating [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. The former could to some extent impose their meanings on the latter; therefore they were able to "label" minor delinquent youngsters as criminal. These youngsters would often take the label on board, indulge in crime more readily, and become [[Free will|actors]] in the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" of the powerful groups. Later developments in this set of theories were by [[Howard S. Becker|Howard Becker]] and [[Edwin Lemert]], in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Becker, Howard |title=Outsiders |publisher=Free Press |year=1963 |isbn=978-0-684-83635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]] developed the concept of "[[moral panic]]" describing societal reaction to spectacular, alarming social phenomena (e.g. post-World War 2 youth cultures like the [[Mods and Rockers]] in the UK in 1964, [[AIDS epidemic]] and [[football hooliganism]]).

==== Labeling theory ====
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
Labelling theory refers to an individual who is labelled in a particular way and was studied in great detail by Becker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slattery|first=Martin|title=Key Ideas In Sociology|year=2003|publisher=Nelson Thornes|pages=154+}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrives originally from sociology but is regularly used in criminological studies. It is said that when someone is given the label of a criminal they may reject or accept it and continue to commit crime. Even those who initially reject the label can eventually accept it as the label becomes more well known, particularly among their peers. This stigma can become even more profound when the labels are about deviancy, and it is thought that this stigmatization can lead to [[Deviancy amplification spiral|deviancy amplification]]. [[Malcolm W. Klein|Malcolm Klein]] conducted a test which showed that labelling theory affected some youth offenders but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelin|first=Malcolm|journal=Criminal Justice &amp; Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=13|pages=47–79|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0093854886013001004|title=Labeling Theory and Delinquency Policy: An Experimental Test|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061209/http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/13/1/47.short|archivedate=14 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual theories===
[[File:Keyhoe sign.jpg|thumb|right|The self-assessment of the perpetrator of the [[Bath School disaster]] ]]

====Traitor theories====
At the other side of the spectrum, criminologist [[Lonnie Athens]] developed a theory about how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. [[Richard Rhodes]]' ''Why They Kill'' describes Athens' observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =  Rhodes| first =  Richard| title = Why They Kill: The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist| publisher = Vintage| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-375-40249-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rational choice theory====
{{Main|Rational choice theory (criminology)}}
[[File:Cesare Beccaria 1738-1794.jpg|thumb|180px|Cesare Beccaria]]
Rational choice theory is based on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], classical school philosophies of [[Cesare Beccaria]], which were popularized by [[Jeremy Bentham]].  They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender. In ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'' (On Crimes and Punishments, 1763–1764), Beccaria advocated a rational [[penology]]. Beccaria conceived of punishment as the necessary application of the law for a crime; thus, the judge was simply to conform his or her sentence to the law. Beccaria also distinguished between crime and [[sin]], and advocated against the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], as well as [[torture]] and inhumane treatments, as he did not consider them as rational deterrents.

This philosophy was replaced by the positivist and Chicago schools and was not revived until the 1970s with the writings of [[James Q. Wilson]], [[Gary Becker]]'s 1965 article ''Crime and Punishment''&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Becker]], "Crime and Punishment", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol. 76 (2), March–April 1968, p.196-217&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Stigler]]'s 1970 article ''The Optimum Enforcement of Laws''.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler]], "The Optimum Enforcement of Laws", in ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', vol.78 (3), May–June 1970, p. 526–536&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theory argues that criminals, like other people, weigh costs or risks and benefits when deciding whether to commit crime and think in economic terms.&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cornish, Derek |author2=Ronald V. Clarke |year=1986 |title=The Reasoning Criminal |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also try to minimize risks of crime by considering the time, place, and other situational factors.&lt;ref name="cornish"/&gt;

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing [[surveillance]], one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.

With this perspective, [[crime prevention]] or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as [[target hardening]].&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clarke, Ronald V. |year=1992 |title=Situational Crime Prevention |publisher=Harrow and Heston |isbn=978-1-881798-68-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, law enforcement presence, added street lighting, and other measures, are effective in reducing crime.&lt;ref name="clarke-1992"/&gt;

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the [[panopticon]]), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, it would be very easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which the measures required would cost the supermarket so much that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and [[classical liberalism]] have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.

Such rational choice theories, linked to [[neoliberalism]], have been at the basics of [[crime prevention through environmental design]] and underpin the [[Market Reduction Approach]] to theft &lt;ref&gt;Sutton, M.

====Routine activity theory====
{{Main|Routine activity theory}}
Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Felson, Marcus |title=Crime and Everyday Life |year=1994 |publisher=Pine Forge |isbn=978-0-8039-9029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, Lawrence |author2=Marcus Felson |title=Social Change and Crime Rate Trends |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=44 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2094589 |pages=588–608 |issue=4 |jstor=2094589|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.3696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt; Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of "place manager" such as rental property managers who can take [[nuisance]] abatement measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reducing Crime and Drug Dealing by Improving Place Management: A Randomized Experiment |author1=Eck, John |author2=Julie Wartell |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosocial theories===
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as [[genetics]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name=Asghate2011&gt;Kevin M. Beaver and Anthony Walsh. 2011. Biosocial Criminology. Chapter 1 in The Ashgate Research Companion to Biosocial Theories of Crime. 2011. Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aggressive behavior]] has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: [[serotonin]] systems, [[catecholamine]] systems, and the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis]]. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=WALTON K.

===Marxist criminology===
{{Main|Marxist criminology}}
In 1968, young British sociologists formed the [[National Deviancy Symposium|National Deviance Conference]] (NDC) group. The group was restricted to academics and consisted of 300 members. [[Ian Taylor (sociologist)|Ian Taylor]], Paul Walton and [[Jock Young]] – members of the NDC – rejected previous explanations of crime and deviance. Thus, they decided to pursue a new Marxist criminological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The New Criminology'', they argued against the biological "positivism" perspective represented by Lombroso, [[Hans Eysenck]] and Gordon Trasler.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Marxist perspective on crime, "defiance is normal – the sense that men are now consciously involved [...] in assuring their human diversity." Thus Marxists criminologists argued in support of society in which the facts of human diversity, be it social or personal, would not be criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Richard F., "A Critique of Marxist Criminology." Crime and Justice. Vol. 2 (1980). JSTOR. 170 - 171&lt;/ref&gt; They further attributed the processes of crime creation not to genetic or psychological facts, but rather to the material basis of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;J. B.

===Convict Criminology===
Convict criminology is a school of thought in the realm of criminology. Convict criminologists have been directly affected by the [[criminal justice system]], oftentimes having spent years inside the prison system. Researchers in the field of convict criminology such as John Irwin and Stephan Richards argue that traditional criminology can better be understood by those who lived in the walls of a prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=Stephen C.|last2=Ross|first2=Jeffrey Ian|date=2001|title=Introducing the New School of Convict Criminology|jstor=29768063|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=177–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Leyva argues that "prisonization" oftentimes begins before prison, in the home, community, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leyva|first=Martin|last2=Bickel|first2=Christopher|date=2010|title=From Corrections to College: The Value of a Convict's Voice|url=http://convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|journal=Western Criminology Review|volume=11|issue=1|pages=50–60|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809135344/http://www.convictcriminology.org/pdf/Leyva.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queer Criminology===
Queer criminology is a field of study that focuses on [[LGBT]] individuals and their interactions with the criminal justice system. The goals of this field of study are as follows:
* To better understand the history of LGBT individuals and the laws put against the community
* Why LGBT citizens are incarcerated and if or why they are arrested at higher rates than heterosexual and [[cisgender]] individuals
* How queer activists have fought against oppressive laws that criminalized LGBT individuals
* To conduct research and use it as a form of activism through education

====Legitimacy====
The value of pursuing criminology from a queer theorist perspective is contested; some believe that it is not worth researching and not relevant to the field as a whole, and as a result is a subject that lacks a wide berth of research available. On the other hand, it could be argued that this subject is highly valuable in highlighting how LGBT individuals are affected by the criminal justice system. This research also has the opportunity to “queer” the curriculum of criminology in educational institutions by shifting the focus from controlling and monitoring LGBT communities to liberating and protecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Matthew. "Queer Criminology as Activism." Critical Criminology 24.4 (2016): 473-87. Web. 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.  Those values and beliefs are manifested as laws that society agrees upon. However, there are two types of laws:
*[[Natural law]]s are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. Natural laws protect against harm to persons (e.g. murder, rape, assault) or property (theft, larceny, robbery), and form the basis of [[common law]] systems.
* [[Statutory law|Statutes]] are enacted by legislatures and reflect current cultural [[mores]], albeit that some laws may be controversial, e.g. laws that prohibit [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and gambling. Marxist criminology, conflict criminology and critical criminology claim that most relationships between [[state (polity)|state]] and citizen are non-consensual and, as such, [[criminal law]] is not necessarily representative of public beliefs and wishes: it is exercised in the interests of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] or dominant class.  The more right-wing criminologies tend to posit that there is a consensual [[social contract]] between state and citizen.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as [[blue-collar crime]], [[corporate crime]], [[organized crime]], [[political crime]], [[public order crime]], [[state crime]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[white-collar crime]].&lt;ref&gt;"Attack the System » Crime and Conflict Theory."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">The '''Dead Media Project''' was initially proposed by science fiction writer [[Bruce Sterling]] in 1995 as a compilation of obsolete and forgotten communication technologies.&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;[http://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/deadMedia/dM_Manifesto.html Dead Media Project: A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sterling's original motivation for compiling the collection was to present a wider historical perspective on communication technologies that went beyond contemporary excitement for the [[internet]], [[CD-ROM]]s and [[virtual reality|VR]] systems.  Sterling proposed that this collection take form as "The Dead Media Handbook" — a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, book about the failures, collapses and hideous mistakes of media. In raising this challenge he offers a "crisp $50 dollar bill" to the first person to publish the book, which he envisions as a "rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper [[coffee-table book]]".

After articulated in the manifesto "The Dead Media Project — A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal,"&lt;ref name="proposal" /&gt; The Dead Media Project began as a number of persons collecting their notes and the spreading of the archive through a mailing list, moderated by [[Tom Jennings]]. This resulted in a large collective of "field notes" about obsolete communication technologies, about 600 in total [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055700/http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index.html archived online]. The project lost momentum in 2001 and the mailing list died.

The project archive includes a wide variety of notes from [[Inca]]n [[quipu]]s, through Victorian [[phenakistoscope]]s, to the departed [[video game]]s and home computers of the 1980s. Dead still-image display technologies include the [[stereopticon]], the [[Protean View]], the [[Zogroscope]], the [[Polyorama Panoptique]], Frith's [[Cosmoscope]], Knight's [[Cosmorama]], Ponti's [[Megalethoscope]] (1862), Rousell's [[Graphoscope]] (1864), [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone's]] [[stereoscope]] (1832), and dead [[Viewmaster]] knockoffs.

In 2009, artist [[Garnet Hertz]] published a bookwork project titled "A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptlab.com/problems/ A Collection of Many Problems (In Memory of the Dead Media Handbook)]&lt;/ref&gt; which strived to fulfill some of [[Bruce Sterling]]'s vision for a handbook of obsolete media technologies.  In the book, Hertz presents images of many of the media technologies compiled through the Dead Media mailing list and invites readers to submit their sketches and ideas of a Dead Media Handbook.

The '''''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment''' ('''LTEE''') is an ongoing study in [[experimental evolution]] led by [[Richard Lenski]] that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria since 24 February 1988.&lt;ref name="Source"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/strainsource.html |title=Source of founding strain |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E.

Lenski (@RELenski) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski performed the 10,000th transfer of the experiment on March 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2017/03/13/some-wrinkles-in-time/|title=Some Wrinkles in Time|date=2017-03-13|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in ''E. coli'', in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

==Experimental approach==
The long-term evolution experiment was designed as an open-ended means of empirical examination of central features of [[evolution]].  The experiment was begun with three principal goals:
# To examine the dynamics of evolution, including the rate of evolutionary change.
# To examine the repeatability of evolution.
# To better understand the relationship between change on the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] and [[Genotype|genotypic]] levels.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Richard E. |last1=Lenski |year=2003 |title=Phenotypic and Genomic Evolution during a 20,000-Generation Experiment with the Bacterium ''Escherichia coli'' |pages=225–65 |doi=10.1002/9780470650288.ch8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BIK4_B_180C&amp;pg=PA225 |editor1-first=Jules |editor1-last=Janick |journal=Plant Breeding Reviews |volume=24 |issue=2 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-46892-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the experiment has continued, its scope has grown as new questions in evolutionary biology have arisen that it can be used to address, as the populations' evolution has presented new phenomena to study, and as technology and methodological techniques have advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Jeremy W.|last2=Lenski|first2=Richard E.|date=2015-06-23|title=From Here to Eternity—The Theory and Practice of a Really Long Experiment|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=13|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002185|issn=1544-9173|pmc=4477892|pmid=26102073|pages=e1002185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ''E. coli'' as the experimental organism has allowed many generations and large populations to be studied in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, due to the long use of ''E .coli'' as a principle model organism in [[molecular biology]], a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D|title=The unexhausted potential of E. coli|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.05826|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4373459|pmid=25807083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a "frozen fossil record" of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an ''E. coli'' strain that reproduces only [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], lacks any [[plasmid]]s that could permit [[bacterial conjugation]], and has no viable [[prophage]]. As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of [[mutation]], [[genetic drift]], and [[natural selection]]. This strict asexuality also means that [[genetic marker]]s persist in lineages and clades by [[common descent]], but cannot otherwise spread in the populations.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004"/&gt;

Lenski chose to carry out the experiment with the bacteria grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium called DM25,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dm25liquid.html|title=DM25 Liquid Medium|website=myxo.css.msu.edu|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was initially developed by [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]] for use in isolating [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic]] mutants of ''E. coli'' using [[penicillin]] as a selective agent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=George|last2=Williams|first2=Luther S.|date=1975-04-01|title=Modified Penicillin Enrichment Procedure for the Selection of Bacterial Mutants|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=122|issue=1|pages=345–346|issn=0021-9193|pmc=235679|pmid=1091629}}&lt;/ref&gt; DM25 is supplemented with a low concentration of glucose.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lenski chose this concentration to simplify analysis of the populations' evolution by reducing [[clonal interference]], in which multiple versions of [[allele]]s are competing in an evolving population, while also reducing the possibility of the evolution of ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt;  This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  DM25 also contains a large amount of citrate (about 11 times the concentration of glucose), which was originally included by Davis because it improved the killing efficiency of [[penicillin]] during his experiments, though it is now known to aid in ''E. coli'''s acquisition of iron from the medium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagegg|first=W.|last2=Braun|first2=V.|date=1981-01-01|title=Ferric citrate transport in Escherichia coli requires outer membrane receptor protein fecA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=145|issue=1|pages=156–163|issn=0021-9193|pmc=217256|pmid=7007312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
The 12 populations are maintained in a {{Convert|37|C}} incubator in Lenski's laboratory at [[Michigan State University]]. Each day, 1% of each population is transferred to a flask of fresh DM25 growth medium. The dilution means that each population experiences 6.64 generations, or doublings, each day.  Large, representative samples of each population are frozen with glycerol as a [[cryoprotectant]] at 500-generation (75-day) intervals. The bacteria in these samples remain viable, and can be revived at any time.  This collection of samples is referred to as the "frozen fossil record", and provides a history of the evolution of each population through the entire experiment.  The populations are also regularly screened for changes in [[mean fitness]], and supplemental experiments are regularly performed to study interesting developments in the populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard E. |last=Lenski |url=http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/overview.html |title=Overview of the ''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment |publisher=Michigan State University |work=Richard E.

===Founding strain===
The strain of ''E. coli'' Lenski chose to use in the long-term evolution experiment was derived from "strain Bc251", as described in a 1966 paper by Seymour Lederberg, via Bruce Levin, who had used it in a bacterial ecology experiment in 1972. The defining genetics traits of this strain were: T6&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, Str&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, r&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (unable to grow on [[arabinose]]).&lt;ref name="Source" /&gt; Lenski designated the original founding strain as REL606. Before the beginning of the experiment, Lenski isolated an Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variant  of the strain in which a [[point mutation]] in the ''ara'' [[operon]] had restored growth on arabinose, which he designated as strain REL607. When beginning the long-term evolution experiment, Lenski founded six populations with six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL606. These populations are referred to as Ara-1 through Ara-6. Lenski also founded six more populations from six individual Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies of REL607. These are referred to as populations Ara+1 through Ara+6. The marker differences permit strains to be differentiated on Tetrazolium Arabinose plates, on which Ara&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear red, while Ara&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; colonies appear white to pink. Over the course of the experiment, each population has accumulated a large number of distinct mutations, which permit further means of identifying strains by their population of origin.

Much analysis of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain.&lt;ref name="Plant Breeding Reviews 2004" /&gt; This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a [[power law]] model much better than the hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ribeck|first2=Noah|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=13 December 2013|title=Long-Term Dynamics of Adaptation in Asexual Populations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1364|journal=Science|volume=342|issue=6164|pages=1364–1367|bibcode=2013Sci...342.1364W|doi=10.1126/science.1243357|first1=Michael J.|last1=Wiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment.&lt;ref name="Discover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/12/16/the-search-for-the-perfect-organism/#.VnOqbPGqdhP |title=Could Evolution Ever Yield a ‘Perfect’ Organism? |website=Discover Magazine |last1=Scharping |first1=Nathaniel |accessdate=18 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6drV64ro4?url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2015/12/16/the-search-for-the-perfect-organism/ |archivedate=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1821/20152292 |title=Sustained fitness gains and variability in fitness trajectories in the long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli |website=Proceedings B |publisher=The Royal Society |display-authors=etal |last1=Lenski |first1=Richard E |accessdate=18 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6drVZddgG?url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1821/20152292 |archivedate=18 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of increased cell size in all twelve populations===
[[Image:Lenski10.png|left|thumb|right|Growth in cell size of bacteria in the Lenski experiment]]
All twelve of the experimental populations show an increase in cell size concurrent with a decline in maximum population density, and in many of the populations, a more rounded cell shape.&lt;ref name="Philippe"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Pelosi|first2=Ludovic|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|last4=Schneider|first4=Dominique|year=2008|title=Evolution of Penicillin-Binding Protein 2 Concentration and Cell Shape during a Long-Term Experiment with ''Escherichia coli''|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=191|issue=3|pages=909–21|doi=10.1128/JB.01419-08|pmc=2632098|pmid=19047356|last1=Philippe|first1=Nadège}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the [[gene expression|expression]] of a gene for a [[penicillin-binding protein]], which allowed the mutant bacteria to outcompete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to [[osmotic stress]] and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures.&lt;ref name="Philippe" /&gt;

===Ecological specialization===
Over the course of the experiment, the populations have evolved to specialize on the glucose resource on which they grow. This was first described in 2000, when Cooper and Lenski demonstrated that all populations had experienced decay of unused metabolic functions after 20,000 generations, restricting the range of substances on which the bacteria could grow. Their analysis suggested that this decay was due to [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|antagonistic pleiotropy]], in which mutations that improved ability to grow on glucose had reduced or eliminated the ability to grow on others substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=V.

Moreover, they concluded that the metabolic losses were not due to antagonistic pleiotropy, but the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused portions of the genome, suggesting that adaptation to a simple environment might not necessarily lead to specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leiby|first=Nicholas|last2=Marx|first2=Christopher J.|date=2014-02-01|title=Metabolic erosion primarily through mutation accumulation, and not tradeoffs, drives limited evolution of substrate specificity in Escherichia coli|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=e1001789|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001789|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3928024|pmid=24558347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one population===
====Background====
[[Image:Lenski's long-term lines of E. coli on 25 June 2008, close-up of citrate mutant.jpg|thumb|The population designated Ara-3 (center) is more [[turbid]] because that population evolved to use the [[citrate]] present in the growth medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|date=2016-02-20|website=Telliamed Revisited|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''E. coli'' is normally unable to grow [[Aerobic respiration|aerobically]] on [[Citric acid|citrate]] due to the inability to express a citrate transporter when oxygen is present.&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lbc.msu.edu/evo-ed/pages/Ecoli/cellbio.html|title=Cell Biology: The Use of Citrate|website=EVO-ED|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''E. coli'' has a complete [[citric acid cycle]], and therefore metabolizes citrate as an intermediate during aerobic growth on other substances, including glucose. Most ''E. coli'' can grow anaerobically on citrate via [[fermentation]], if a co-substrate such as glucose is available to provide reducing power.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Stokes|first2=J.L.|date=1952|title=Oxidation of citrate by Escherichia coli|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=63|issue=3|pages=415–420|pmc=169284|pmid=14927574|last1=Lara|first1=F.J.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lütgens|first=M.|last2=Gottschalk|first2=G.|date=1980-07-01|title=Why a co-substrate is required for anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli on citrate|journal=Journal of General Microbiology|volume=119|issue=1|pages=63–70|doi=10.1099/00221287-119-1-63|issn=0022-1287|pmid=6997437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] growth is possible due to the expression of a transmembrane citrate-succinate antiporter gene, ''citT'', which was first identified in 1998. This gene is co-regulated with other genes involved in citrate fermentation found on the ''cit'' operon, which is turned on only when oxygen is absent.&lt;ref name="Evo-Ed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pos|first=Klaas Martinus|last2=Dimroth|first2=Peter|last3=Bott|first3=Michael|date=1998-08-01|title=The Escherichia coli Citrate Carrier CitT: a Member of a  Novel Eubacterial Transporter Family Related to  the 2-Oxoglutarate/Malate Translocator  from Spinach Chloroplasts|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=180|issue=16|pages=4160–4165|issn=0021-9193|pmc=107412|pmid=9696764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability to grow aerobically on citrate, referred to as a Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype, is considered a defining characteristic of ''E. coli'' as a species, and one that has been a valuable means of differentiating ''E. coli'' from pathogenic ''Salmonella''. While Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; strains of ''E. coli'' have been isolated from environmental and agricultural samples, in every such case, the trait was found to be due to the presence of a plasmid containing a foreign citrate transporter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=C.

====Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolves in the LTEE====
In 2008, Lenski's team, led by [[Zachary Blount|Zachary D. Blount]], reported that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate had evolved in one population. Around generation 33,127, a dramatic increase in turbidity was observed in the population designated Ara-3. They found that the population contained clones that were able to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). This metabolic capacity permitted the population to grow several-fold larger than it had previously, due to the large amount of citrate present in the medium. Examination of frozen fossil samples of the populations showed that Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones could be isolated as early as 31,500 generations. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants in the population were found to possess a number of genetic markers unique to the Ara-3 population, which excluded the possibility that they were contaminants, rather than spontaneous mutants. In a series of experiments that "replayed" the tape of Ara-3 evolution from Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones isolated from samples frozen at various time points in the population's history, they demonstrated that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate was more likely to re-evolve in a subset of genetically pure, evolved clones. In these experiments, they observed 19 new, independent instances of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; re-evolution, but only when starting from clones isolated from after generation 20,000. Fluctuation tests showed that clones from this generation and later displayed a rate of mutation to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was significantly higher than the ancestral rate. Even in these later clones, the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was on the order of one occurrence per trillion cell divisions.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956 /&gt;

Lenski and his colleagues concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; function in this one population arose due to one or more earlier, possibly nonadaptive, "potentiating" mutations that increased the rate of mutation to an accessible level. The data suggested that citrate usage involved at least two mutations subsequent to these "potentiating" mutations. More generally, the authors suggest these results indicate, following the argument of [[Stephen Jay Gould]], "that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact" on the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=pmid18524956/&gt; These findings have come to be considered a significant instance of the impact of historical contingency on evolution.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blount|first=Zachary D.|date=2016-01-16|title=A case study in evolutionary contingency|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.12.007|issn=1879-2499|pmid=26787098|volume=58|pages=82–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desjardins|first=Eric|date=2011-01-01|title=Historicity and Experimental Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/DESHAE|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=26|issue=3|pages=339–364|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9256-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beatty|first=John|last2=Carrera|first2=Isabel|date=2011-01-01|title=When What Had to Happen Was Not Bound to Happen: History, Chance, Narrative, Evolution|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/BEAWWH|journal=Journal of the Philosophy of History|volume=5|issue=3|pages=471–495|doi=10.1163/187226311x599916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait and implications for evolutionary innovation====
[[File:Novel rnk-citT module and citT expression - actualization of Cit+ trait in LTEE population Ara-3.svg|thumb|418x418px|The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait was actualized by a duplication mutation that created a new regulatory module by placing a copy of the ''citT'' gene that encodes a citrate-succinate antiporter under the control of a promoter that supports expression under aerobic conditions. This mutation results in the CitT transporter being expressed when oxygen is present, permitting growth on citrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blount-lab.org/photos.html|title=Photos|website=Blount Lab|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2012, Lenski and his team reported the results of a genomic analysis of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait that shed light on the genetic basis and evolutionary history of the trait. The researchers had sequenced the entire genomes of twenty-nine clones isolated from various time points in the Ara-3 population's history. They used these sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the population, which showed that the population had diversified into three [[clades]] by 20,000 generations.  The Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants had evolved in one of these, which they called Clade 3. Clones that had been found to be potentiated in earlier research were distributed among all three clades, but were over-represented in Clade 3. This led the researchers to conclude that there had been at least two potentiating mutations involved in Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref name="Blount2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blount ZD, Barrick JE, Davidson CJ, Lenski RE |title=Genomic analysis of a key innovation in an experimental ''Escherichia coli'' population |journal=Nature |date=2012-09-27 |volume=489 |issue=7417 |pages=513–518 |doi=10.1038/nature11514 |pmid=22992527 |pmc=3461117|bibcode = 2012Natur.489..513B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that all Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clones had mutations in which 2933 base pair segment of DNA was duplicated or amplified. The duplicated segment contained the gene for the citrate transporter protein used in anaerobic growth on citrate, ''citT''. The duplication is tandem, and resulted in copies that were head-to-tail with respect to each other. This new configuration placed a copy of the previously silent, unexpressed ''citT'' under the control of the adjacent ''rnk'' gene's promoter, which directs expression when oxygen is present. This new ''rnk-citT'' module produced a novel regulatory pattern for ''citT'', activating expression of the citrate transporter when oxygen was present, and thereby enabled aerobic growth on citrate.&lt;ref name=Blount2012 /&gt;

Movement of this ''rnk-citT'' module into the genome of a potentiated Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clone was shown to be sufficient to produce a Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype. However, the initial Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype conferred by the duplication was very weak, and only granted a ~1% fitness benefit. The researchers found that the number of copies of the ''rnk-citT'' module had to be increased to strengthen the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait sufficiently to permit the bacteria to grow well on the citrate. Further mutations after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria became dominant in the population continued to accumulate improved growth on citrate.

The researchers concluded that the evolution of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait occurred in three distinct phases in which mutations accumulated that increased the rate of mutation to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the trait itself appeared in a weak form, and, finally, the trait was improved by later mutations. Blount et al. suggested that this pattern might be typical of how novel traits in general evolve, and proposed a three-step model of evolutionary innovation:
# '''Potentiation''': a genetic background evolves in which a trait is mutationally accessible, making the trait's evolution possible.
# '''Actualization''': a mutation occurs that produces the trait, making it manifest, albeit likely in a weak form.
# '''Refinement''': Once the trait exists, if it provides selective benefit, mutations will accumulate that improve the trait, making it effective. This phase is open-ended, and will continue so long as refining mutations arise and the trait remains beneficial.&lt;ref name="Blount2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
This model has seen acceptance in evolutionary biology. In 2015 paleontologist [[Douglas Erwin]] suggested a modification to a four-step model to better reflect a possible distinction between evolutionary novelty and evolutionary innovation, and to highlight the importance of environmental conditions: potentiation, generation of novel phenotypes (actualization), adaptive refinement, and exploitation (conversion of a novelty to an innovation as it becomes important for the ecological establishment of possessing organisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|date=2015-10-05|title=Novelty and Innovation in the History of Life|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=19|pages=R930–940|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.019|issn=1879-0445|pmid=26439356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a research team led by Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] described the application of a new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Deatherage|first2=Daniel E.|last3=Ellington|first3=Andrew D.|last4=Georgiou|first4=George|last5=Barrick|first5=Jeffrey E.|date=2014-02-11|title=Recursive genomewide recombination and sequencing reveals a key refinement step in the evolution of a metabolic innovation in Escherichia coli|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=6|pages=2217–2222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1314561111|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3926077|pmid=24379390|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.2217Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method used multiple rounds of a process in which [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|F plasmid]] based [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] between a 33,000 generation Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; clone, CZB154, and the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait, which they refer to as Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;. They found that the ''rnk-citT'' module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was sufficient to produce a weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that conferred a strong, Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the ''rnk-citT'' module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called ''dctA'', caused a massive increase in the expression of the [[Dcu family|DctA transporter]], which functions to import C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells to re-uptake [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, ''dcuS'', that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the ''dctA'' mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit.

Quandt and colleagues later published findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quandt|first=Erik M.|last2=Gollihar|first2=Jimmy|last3=Blount|first3=Zachary D.|last4=Ellington|first4=Andrew D.|last5=Georgiou|first5=George|last6=Barrick|first6=Jeffrey E.|date=2015-01-01|title=Fine-tuning citrate synthase flux potentiates and refines metabolic innovation in the Lenski evolution experiment|journal=eLife|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.09696|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718724|pmid=26465114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutation was in the ''gltA'' gene, which encodes [[Citrate synthase family|citrate synthase]], an enzyme involved in the flow of carbon into the [[citric acid cycle]]. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved growth on [[acetate]]. Moreover, with the ''gltA'' mutation, the ''rnk-citT'' module that causes the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The ''gltA'' mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in ''gltA'' countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving growth on citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in ''gltA'' first potentiated, and then refined growth on citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on growth on acetate, and that the potentiating mutations that led to evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use.

====Investigation of post-Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ecology and persistent diversity====
A small subpopulation of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells unable to grow on citrate, and belonging to a separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells became dominant. Early findings showed that this diversity was partly due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium.&lt;ref name="pmid18524956" /&gt; Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority. They showed that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells release [[Succinic acid|succinate]], [[Malic acid|malate]], and [[Fumaric acid|fumarate]] during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate transporter protein that was silent in the ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Daniel H.|last4=Lenski|first4=Richard E.|date=2015-06-17|title=Evolution and coexistence in response to a key innovation in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli|biorxiv=020958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation eventually went [[Extinction|extinct]] in the population between 43,500 and 44,000 generations. This extinction was shown to not be due to the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; majority evolving to be able to [[Invasive species|invade]] the niche occupied by the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; minority. Indeed, Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; clones could invade Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations from after the extinction event. Moreover, in an experiment in which they restarted twenty replicates of the Ara-3 population from the sample frozen 500 generations before the extinction, Turner et al. found that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulation had not gone extinct in any of the replicates after 500 generations of evolution. One of these replicates was continued for 2,500 generations, over which Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; continued to coexist. The researchers concluded that the extinction of Cit&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; had been due to some unknown "rare environmental perturbation", similar to that which can impact natural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extinction-lab-bottle-was-fluke-experiment-finds|title=Extinction in lab bottle was a fluke, experiment finds|last=Saey|first=Tina Hesman|website=Science News|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final replicate was integrated into the main LTEE experiment, becoming the thirteenth population, Ara-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Caroline B.|last2=Blount|first2=Zachary D.|last3=Lenski|first3=Richard E.|date=2015-11-18|title=Replaying Evolution to Test the Cause of Extinction of One Ecotype in an Experimentally Evolved Population|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0142050|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0142050|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651540|pmid=26581098|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1042050T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of citrate-usage findings====
Other researchers have experimented on evolving aerobic citrate-utilizing ''E. coli''. Dustin Van Hofwegen et al., working in the lab of [[Scott Minnich]], were able to isolate 46 independent citrate-utilizing mutants of ''E. coli'' in just 12 to 100 generations using highly prolonged selection under starvation, during which the bacteria would sample more mutations more rapidly.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hovde|first2=Carolyn J.|last3=Minnich|first3=Scott A.|last4=Silhavy|first4=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Rapid Evolution of Citrate Utilization by Escherichia coli by Direct Selection Requires citT and dctA|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1022–1034|doi=10.1128/JB.00831-15|last1=Van Hofwegen|first1=Dustin J.|pmid=26833416|pmc=4800869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research, the genomic DNA sequencing revealed an amplification of the ''citT'' and ''dctA'' loci, and rearrangement of DNA were the same class of mutations identified in the experiment by Richard Lenski and his team. They concluded that the rarity of the citrate-utilizing mutant in Lenski's research was likely a result of the selective experimental conditions used by his team rather than being a unique evolutionary speciation event.&lt;ref name="Rapid Evolution Van Hofwegen" /&gt;

John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin reviewed the approaches in both the Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on ''E. coli''. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; variants.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Maisnier-Patin|first2=Sophie|last3=Silhavy|first3=T. J.|date=1 April 2016|title=Reinterpreting Long-Term Evolution Experiments: Is Delayed Adaptation an Example of Historical Contingency or a Consequence of Intermittent Selection?|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=198|issue=7|pages=1009–1012|doi=10.1128/JB.00110-16|last1=Roth|first1=John R.|pmc=4800865}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, the period of less than a day during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of ''E. coli'' being able accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the next.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt; On the other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using ''E. coli''. Roth and Maisnier-Patin suggest that the serial dilution of ''E. coli'' and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of ''E. coli'' from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization.&lt;ref name="Reinterpreting" /&gt;

In response, Blount and Lenski acknowledge that the problem is not with the experiments or the data, but with the interpretations made by Van Hofwegen et al. and Maisnier-Patin and Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45423/title/Similar-Data--Different-Conclusions/|title=Similar Data, Different Conclusions {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|website=The Scientist|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenski notes that the rapid evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was not necessarily unexpected since his team was also able to produce multiple Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants in a few weeks during the replay experiments they reported in the 2008 paper in which his team first described the evolution of aerobic citrate use in the LTEE.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/on-the-evolution-of-citrate-use/|title=On the Evolution of Citrate Use|website=Telliamed Revisited|last1=Lenski|first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as a "speciation event" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said "that becoming Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was only a first step on the road to possible speciation", and thus did not propose that the Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; Lenski acknowledges that scientists, including him and his team, often use short hand and jargon when discussing speciation, instead of writing more carefully and precisely on the matter, and this can cause issues.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; However, he notes that speciation is generally considered by evolutionary biologists to be a process, and not an event.&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt; He also criticizes Van Hofwegen et al. and Roth and Maisnier-Patin for positing "false dichotomies" regarding the complex concept of historical contingency. He argues that historical contingency means that history matters, and that their 2008 paper presented data that showed that the evolution of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE was contingent upon mutations that had accumulated earlier. He concludes that "...historical contingency was invoked and demonstrated in a specific context, namely that of the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the LTEE—it does not mean that the emergence of Cit&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is historically contingent in other experimental contexts, nor for that matter that other changes in the LTEE are historically contingent—in fact, some other evolved changes in the LTEE have been highly predictable and not (or at least not obviously) contingent on prior mutations in the populations."&lt;ref name="Lenski Telliamed" /&gt;

'''''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''''', 1st ed., 2012, is a comprehensive, multi-volume, English language encyclopedia of [[Hinduism]], comprising ''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'', a [[Sanskrit]] phrase, meaning "the eternal [[dharma|law]]", or the "eternal way", that is used to refer to Hinduism, [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|title=Hinduism is an intellectual system, not religion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423060143/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 7,184 page, 11-volume publication with full-color illustrations of temples, places, thinkers, rituals and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rupapublications.com/client/Book/Encyclopedia-of-Hinduism.aspx|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism Ed.

Under preparation for 25 years, it has been edited by Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]] with contribution from over 2000 scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Sunday Tribune - Books | url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120219/spectrum/book1.htm | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopaedia provides conceptual perspective and a general understanding of the different facets of Hinduism. It does not confine itself to religion alone, and has in it entries on art, history, language, literature, philosophy, polity, sciences, and women's studies. The editorial introduction records:

:"This encyclopaedia has been prepared to give a fairly comprehensive idea of an ancient way of life, a culture that has roots going back thousands of years and has been called ‘Hinduism’ in the last two hundred years of English discourse. It is a book of knowledge about facts, theories, systems, practices, institutions, beliefs, texts, thinkers and values of, what in fact is, a continuity of one of the two living knowledge cultures of the world, the Vedic (Semitic being the other). Hindu society has been a ‘knowledge society’  in its proper sense for at least 5000 years: the word ‘Veda’ itself means ‘knowledge'."

On 3–4 April 2010, a preview and blessings ceremony for the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was held at Parmarth Niketan, attended by [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], M.M. Swami Gurusharananand, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, [[Ramesh Oza|Sant Shri Rameshbhai Oza]], [[Ramdev|Swami Ramdev]], [[Morari Bapu|Sant Shri Morari Bapu]] and other religious leaders as well as top political leaders, including [[L. K. Advani|Shri L.K. Advani]] and then-Chief Minister of Uttarakhand [[Ramesh Pokhriyal|Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank]], and IHRF board members and trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parmarth.com/updates/april2010.pdf April 2010 Special Newsletter] Parmarth Niketan&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was launched at the University of South Carolina on 26 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=6353#.VA7HJ2O6-Yg "USC to launch ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Aug. 26"] University of South Carolina News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/multimedia/2013/08/130827_encyclopedia_hinduism_gal_sb.shtml 25 बरसों में संजोया हिन्दू धर्म का विश्वकोश] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/25-years-making-hindu-encyclopedia-complete 25 Years in Making, Hindu Encyclopedia Complete] Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was presented to the President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee|Shri Pranab Mukherjee]] on 23 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=0 President of India receives a copy of ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''] Press Information Bureau, Government of India, President's Secretariat, Press Release 23-06-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inception ==
The idea was conceived by Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], president of [[Parmarth Niketan]] Ashram, at a Hindu-Jain Temple in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1987. Subsequently, in November of the same year, the India Heritage Research Foundation was formed to execute the idea of preparing an authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =A Landmark Publication - Shri L. K. Advani | url =http://blog.lkadvani.in/blog-in-english/a-landmark-publication | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[L. K. Advani]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao, Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at University of Virginia was appointed the Chief Editor.

== Development == 
Over the next five years, Swami Chidanand Saraswati and Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao assembled an international team of scholars. In 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], Prime Minister of India at the time, spoke effusively in praise of the project:

:"Your undertaking is rightly called the 'Project of the Third Millennium.’ This is a monumental undertaking.  It is indeed a [[Jnana]] [[Yajna]].  Hence, all those who have offered their time, talent and scholarship as ahuti for the success of this [[Yajna]] deserve our heartiest applause and felicitations."

In early 2006, Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]], Professor of English and Concurrent Professor of Sanskrit Studies who had retired as rector for [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], Delhi the previous year, was appointed chief editor of the project.

== Foreword ==
The first volume of the encyclopedia contains a 44-page foreword by Dr. [[Karan Singh]]. In the opening paragraph, he writes:

:"Hinduism calls itself the Sanatana Dharma, the eternal faith, because it is based not upon the teachings of a single preceptor but on the collective wisdom and inspiration of great seers and sages from the very dawn of Indian civilization."

The closing comments of Dr. Singh's forward begin with the following note:

:"The long awaited publication of a massive eleven-volume ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is a major publishing event. Many years of scholarship, organization and devotion have gone into the preparation of what will be a landmark in the history of Hindu research."

== Reviews == 
Indrajit Hazra, writing for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', said its "entries are crisp, provide background and foreground, and come with a bibliography." The review goes on to add:

:"The production is excellent, as is the quality of images that are scattered across the volumes. With entries that include the ''Dhammapada'' (the main text of Theravada Buddhism), the 'Chipko movement' (the organised environmental movement to resist the destruction of forests in India'), as well as the 'Saura Mandala' (solar system), clearly, this is an encyclopedia that doesn't define 'Hinduism' in any narrow, proselytising way."

Hazra concludes his review by calling the encyclopedia "a startlingly good treasure trunk for anyone interested in the history of ideas to dip into." Former Home Minister of India [[L.K. Advani]] called the work "a landmark publication."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">The '''English Broadside Ballad Archive''' ('''EBBA''') is a [[digital library]] of 17th-century English [[Broadside (music)#Broadside ballads|Broadside Ballads]], a project of the English Department of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. The project archives ballads in multiple accessible digital formats.

==History==

The English Broadside Ballad Archive was created in 2003 by Patricia Fumerton, Professor of English at [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] to digitize broadside ballads of the heyday of the 17th century. Many of these ballads are currently held in difficult to access libraries in both North America and the United Kingdom, often in fragile condition, and EBBA’s aim is to make them accessible to users in a variety of digital formats. Since then, EBBA has received six Collections and Resources grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant, and Faculty Research Grants and Instructional Improvement Grants from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As of August 2015, the project has archived over 7000 of the estimated 11,000 extant broadside ballads.

==Scope==

As of August 2015, '''EBBA''' has archived 7,124 broadside ballads, from 20 different collections held at six different libraries worldwide. The collections range from the very well-known and recognized by name - such as those housed at the [[Pepys Library]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] - to the relatively unknown. The project has currently archived ballads from the following libraries, with partnerships in place to begin archiving ballads from several other libraries in the next two years.

===Holding Libraries and Named Collections===

* [[British Library]]
** [[Roxburghe Ballads]]
* [[Glasgow University Library]]
** Euing Collection
* [[Houghton Library]] of [[Harvard University]]
** [[Alfred Henry Huth|Huth]] Collection
* [[Huntington Library]]
** [[James Bindley|Bindley]] Collection
** Bridgewater Collection
** Britwell Collection
* [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]
** [[Pepys Library|Pepys Ballads]]
* [[National Library of Scotland]]
** Crawford Collection
** Rosebery Collection

==Archival Formats==

In addition to cataloging all of its holdings exhaustively, '''EBBA''' archives ballads in up to five different formats, all designed to make the ballads more accessible to modern scholars and members of the public.

===Ballad Facsimile===

All ballads are archived on the website as a high quality, 600 dpi image of the ballad sheet, trimmed with a 2mm margin.

===Album Facsimile===

Those ballads that were pasted into albums or archived in any format other than loose-leaf are also archived on the website in another high quality photograph of the ballad sheet on its surrounding album page.

===Transcriptions===

All ballads, often originally rendered in difficult to read [[black letter]], or Gothic font, and other early modern typefaces, are transcribed into Times New Roman using a diplomatic double-keyed transcription process, and those transcriptions are included in the archive.

===Facsimile Transcriptions===

All ballads are archived in Facsimile Transcriptions, in which the original blocks of text from the Ballad Facsimile have been replaced with blocks of text from the modern transcription, resulting in an image that preserves the visual experience of the original ballad, including woodcut impression illustrations, yet is easily readable by a modern audience.

===Ballad Recording===

Many broadside ballads include a tune imprint, indicating to which well-known tune they were meant to be sung. For those ballads for which '''EBBA''' has been able to identify the tune, recordings of the sung ballad are available on the archive.

==Examples of Notable Holdings==

* [[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]
* [[The Ballad of Chevy Chase|Chevy Chase]]
* Unexpected Perspectives such as [[Lady Isabel's Tragedy]]
* Many Robin Hood Ballads including [[Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham]]
* Examples of the [[Titus Andronicus (ballad)|Titus Andronicus]] tradition

'''Ethiopian manuscripts''' are known to have reached Europe as early as the fifteenth century, perhaps even earlier, through Egypt, Ethiopian pilgrims to the Holy Land and through members of the [[Ethiopian]] monastery of [[St Stephen of the Abyssinians]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="D. Nosnitsin 2012"&gt;D. Nosnitsin, "Ethiopian Manuscripts and Ethiopian manuscript studies. A brief overview and evaluation," ''Gazette du livre médiéval'', 58 (2012), 2–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, travellers, missionaries, military personnel and scholars contributed to the development of collections outside Ethiopia. In Europe, the three biggest collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are in Rome (Biblioteca Apostolica Vatican), in Paris (Bibliothèque nationale de France) and in London (British Library). These three organisations together hold about 2,700 manuscripts. Oriental collections of nearly all significant European libraries also have Ethiopian material, with some still pursuing a policy of acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;V. Six, “Neuzugang von äthiopischen Handschriften an  die Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz,” ''Aethiopica'' 10 (2007), 177-83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Monasteries and modern institutions in Ethiopia have, meanwhile, maintained extensive collections and in some cases are still centres of manuscript production. [[Parchment]] (''berānnā'') was used for Ethiopian manuscripts from the time of the Four Gospels books of Abbā Garimā.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Islamic manuscripts, paper only came into general use twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are eighty eight languages in Ethiopia according to [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref name="Ethnet"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET ''Ethnologue'' page on Ethiopian languages]&lt;/ref&gt; but not all support manuscript cultures. The majority of manuscripts are in [[Ge'ez]], the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia.

'''Catalogues''' of individual collections were written in the nineteenth century, with a key work for the disposition of Ethiopian MSS more widely prepared in 1995 and published by Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson, ''Répertoire des Bibliothéques et des Catalogues de Manuscrits Éthiopiens'' (DNRS Editions; Paris: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Éditions, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, an online inventory has been developed that documents items labelled as “Ethiopian manuscripts’’ in libraries all over the world. This "[http://www.menestrel.fr/spip.php?rubrique694&amp;lang=en&amp;art=en Inventory of Libraries and Catalogues of Ethiopian Manuscripts]" was created in 2008 and is maintained since then by A. Wion, C. Bosc-Tiessé and M.-L. Derat from CNRS (Paris). The list of institutions below is a partial selection of the most prominent and best known collections, giving special attention to the individual researchers involving in forming the collections and those scholars who wrote the catalogues.

==Accademia dei Lincei, Rome==
The [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in [[Rome]] holds the collection of 138 manuscripts formed by [[Carlo Conti Rossini]]. The catalogue prepared by [[Stefan Strelcyn]] includes 30 further manuscripts in the Fonds Caetani.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de l'Accademia nazionale dei Lincei: fonds Conti Rossini et fonds Caetani 209, 375, 376, 377, 378'' (Roma: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest manuscripts in the collections date to the fifteenth century with some having a provenance of [[Debre Damo]].

==Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris==
[[File:Saint Ildefonse BnF Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v.jpg|thumb|Miracle de Notre Dame and Saint Ildefonso, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v]]
The collections in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], held primarily in the Département des Manuscrits, have been subject to several cataloguing campaigns. In 1877 a catalogue was published by [[Hermann Zotenberg]] and gave an account of the 170 manuscripts then in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;H. Zotenberg, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (gheez et amharique) de la Bibliothèque nationale'' (Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1877). Available online at https://archive.org/details/manuscritsorient00bibl&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic holdings were subsequently enlarged by the three collections, those of d'Abbadie, Casimir Mondon-Vidailhet,&lt;ref&gt;For him see: http://data.bnf.fr/15411049/casimir_mondon-vidailhet/ Accessed Sēptembre 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcel Griaule]] which increased the number at BnF to more than 970 manuscripts. Zotenberg's work was accordingly followed by a catalogue of the Mondon-Vidailhet collection prepared by M. Chaine.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chaine, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la collection Mondon-Vidailhet'' (Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1913). Available online at https://archive.org/stream/catalogueethiopia00bibluoft#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; The Griaule collection was published by [[Stefan Strelcyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (Collection Griaule). Ethiopien 301-304, 675-687 Tome IV'' (Paris: Impr. nationale, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; The BnF has the largest single collection of magico-medical scrolls in France, with over 160 specimens in the Griaule collection.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvain Grébaut and S. Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la Collection Griaule'' (Paris: Institut d'Ethnologie, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodleian Library, Oxford== 
The early collections in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] came from [[James Bruce]], and consisted of 25 Ethiopic manuscripts purchased by the library in 1843. The collection soon grew to 33 manuscripts and these were catalogued and published in 1848 by [[August Dillmann]].&lt;ref&gt;August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae Oxoniensis. Pars 7 Pars 7'' (Oxonii: E Typographeo Academico, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-nineteenth century the collection has expanded to 130 items. A notable addition in 2002 was an illustrated seventeenth-century manuscript of a Marian text, ''Arganona Weddase'' (‘Harp of Praise’) (MS. Aeth.e.28).&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved September 2016 https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/hebrew&lt;/ref&gt; The uncatalogued manuscripts were revisited in 2007 by Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā.&lt;ref name="Delamarter Tafarā 2007"&gt;Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā, ''A Catalogue of Previously Uncatalogued Ethiopic Manuscripts in England: Twenty-Three Manuscripts in the Bodleian, Cambridge University and John Rylands University Libraries and in a Private Collection,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Manchester, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Library, London==
[[File:Annunciation to Zechariah British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|Folio from an illustrated Bible, Annunciation to Zechariah, [[British Library]] Add. MS 59874.]]
The founding Ethiopic collections in the [[British Library]]—74 manuscripts—came from the [[Church Mission Society]] and the materials that had been assembled by [[Karl Wilhelm Isenberg]] and [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]], missionaries and linguists who travelled to the country between 1839 and 1842.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, retrieved August, 2016: http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelplang/ethiopic/ethiopiancoll/. See further: Isenberg and Krapf, [[Journals of Isenberg and Krapf]] (London, 1843), visible online at https://archive.org/stream/journalsofrevmes00isen/journalsofrevmes00isen_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of the collection has an earlier provenance, for example, ''Extracts from the Chronicle of Axum'', written on paper in about 1810 with the book plate of [[George Annesley, 2nd Earl of Mountnorris]].&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), 319. MS Add 19,341. The book was purchased at the Arley Castle sale of 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 the Trustees of the [[British Museum]] published a catalogue of the Ethiopian manuscripts that were then under their care. This catalogue was prepared by [[August Dillmann]] and included 88 items.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii. August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Orientalium qui in Museo Britannico asservantur. Pars tertia, Pars tetra'' (Londini: Impensis Curatorum Musei Britannici, 1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Library collections grew in 1868 when 349 manuscripts came after the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] against emperor [[Tewodros II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rita Pankhurst, "The library of Emperor Tewodros II at Mäqdäla (Magdala)," ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 36, no. 1 (1973): 15-42. https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0041977X00097974  Stéphane Ancel, Denis Nosnitsin, "On the History of the Library of Mäqdäla: New Findings," ''Aethiopica'' 17 (2014): 90-95, dec. 2014. ISSN 2194-4024. Available at: &lt;http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/aethiopica/article/view/859&gt;. Date accessed: 30 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A catalogue of the enlarged collection was prepared by [[William Wright (orientalist)]] and published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine decades later, [[Stefan Strelcyn]] reviewed the manuscripts that had come to the British Library after 1877 and published a catalogue of them.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, Catalogue of Ethiopian Manuscripts in the British Library Acquired Since the Year 1877 (London: British Museum Publications, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue lists 108 items (some with multiple parts) and covers the general range of [[Ethiopian literature]] from Biblical texts to magical and divinatory writings.

The transfer of the [[India Office]] collection to the British Library in 1982 brought 6 further manuscripts to the collection, first acquired in 1842 by the India Museum in [[East India House]]. 

A further collection of 39 manuscripts came to the British Library from Roger Wenman Cowley (1940-1988). Cowley spent 15 years in Ethiopia as an Anglican missionary and teacher, during which time he assembled a collection of Biblical commentaries in Amharic.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Stoffregen-Pedersen, ''Traditional Ethiopian exegesis of the Book of Psalms'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1995): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; His MSS consist of copies on paper commissioned by Cowley and executed during the years 1967-77 (except for numbers 19-61, 32, 37, 40-42 and 44 which are copies made at different times in the twentieth century). Cowley used this material in his book ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation'', published in 1988. &lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Cowley, ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation: A Study in Exegetical Tradition and Hermeneutics'', University of Cambridge Oriental Publications, Published for the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 38, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988), review by [[Edward Ullendorf]], ''Journal of  Semitic Studies'' 15, no. 1 (1990): 181-183. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/XXXV.1.181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambridge University Library, Cambridge==
The Ethiopic collections at the [[Cambridge University Library]] were catalogued by [[Edward Ullendorff]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ullendorff, ''Catalogue of Ethiopian manuscripts in the Cambridge University Library'' (Cambridge, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual colleges at Cambridge also hold Ethiopic manuscripts and have given digital access to some of them.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2016: http://trin-sites-pub.trin.cam.ac.uk/james/viewpage.php?index=152.&lt;/ref&gt; The uncatalogued manuscripts were revisited in 2007 by Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā.&lt;ref name="Delamarter Tafarā 2007"/&gt;

==Chester Beatty Library, Dublin==
The [[Chester Beatty Library|Chester Beatty collection]] of 58 Ethiopian manuscripts includes illustrated gospel books, psalters and devotional works. Chester Beatty purchased some of the collection at auction in London in the 1930s and bought the rest in the 1950s and later.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2015 http://www.cbl.ie/Collections/The-Western-Collection/Manuscripts/Ethiopian.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were studied and published by Cerulli in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Cerulli, ''I manoscritti etiopici della Chester Beatty Library in Dublino: memorial'' [Roma]: [Accademia nazionale dei Lincei], 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edinburgh University Library, Edinburgh==
The [[Edinburgh University Library]] has a small collection of Ethiopic manuscripts acquired from a variety of sources. These are as follows: Or. MS 461-462 Acts of St. George according to Theodotus of Ancyra, with 20 illustrations, between boards; Or. MS 477, Or. MS 644, Or. MS 649, Or. MS 651, Or. MS 654, Or. MS 655 Psalms, Or.

==Gunda Gunde Monastery, Tigray Region==
The [[Gunda Gunde]] monastery is located in the Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone of the northern [[Tigray Region]] in Ethiopia. It is known for its prolific scriptorium, and library of Ge'ez manuscripts. This collection of over 220 volumes, all but one dating from before the 16th century, is one of the largest collections of its kind in Ethiopia. The Gunda Gunde Manuscript Project, based at the [[University of Toronto]], seeks to preserve a digitized manuscript collection of the monastery's holdings.&lt;ref&gt;See: http://gundagunde.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library, Collegeville, Minn.==
The [[Hill Museum &amp; Manuscript Library]] is located at and sponsored by [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|Saint John's Abbey]] and University in [[Collegeville Township, Stearns County, Minnesota|Collegeville]], Minnesota. The library holds a substantial number of photographs, images and digital copies of Ethiopian manuscripts and is host to the Ethiopian Study Center.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2016, http://www.hmml.org/ethiopia-study-center.html&lt;/ref&gt; The library is also the home for the Ethiopian Manuscript Microfilm Library.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2016: http://www.hmml.org/emml.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa==
The [[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]] in [[Addis Ababa]] has a collection of approximately 1500 manuscripts, still largely uncatalogued as of 2012.&lt;ref name="D. Nosnitsin 2012"/&gt; However a team led by Alessandro Gori undertook a listing exercise with regard to the Arabic materials and published the results in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Gori et al, ''Handlist of the Manuscripts in the Institute of Ethiopian Studies. The Arabic Materials for the Ethiopian Islamic Tradition,'' (Pickwick Publications: Eugene OR, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Rylands Library, Manchester==
The [[John Rylands Library]] owns 45 items on parchment and paper, dating from the 1600s and later.

==Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey==
The core collection of Ethiopic manuscripts at [[Princeton University]] was formed by [[Robert Garrett]] who collected 113 items in Ge’ez and [[Amharic]] and donated them to Princeton University Library in 1942. The collection is fully catalogued online.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2016: http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/C0744.03/c0001&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the collection are [[Psalters]], Miracles of Mary, Prayer books, [[Homilies]] of Michael, [[Synaxaria]], [[Anaphora of Addai and Mari]], Missals and Gospels. Divination texts are also part of the collection. One of the Miracles of Mary is among the oldest and probably dates to the seventeenth century; the other materials mostly date to the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Garrett acquired most his Ethiopic manuscripts from [[Enno Littmann]] who led expeditions to [[Tigray Region]] and [[Axum]] in 1905 and 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved August, 2016: https://rbsc.princeton.edu/topics/316/divisions/15&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''external iliac veins''' are large [[vein]]s that connect the [[femoral vein]]s to the [[common iliac vein]]s.  Their origin is at the inferior margin of the [[inguinal ligament]]s and they terminate when they join the [[internal iliac vein]]s (to form the [[common iliac vein]]s).

Both external iliac veins are accompanied along their course by [[external iliac artery|external iliac arteries]].

==Structure==
A continuation of the [[femoral vein]],&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ihGmxzamekC|title=Last's Anatomy: Regional and Applied|author=Sinnatamby|first=Chummy S.|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=0-7020-4839-9|edition=12th|location=|place=Great Britain|pages=309|chapter=5|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the external iliac vein starts at the level of the inguinal ligament.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozes|first1=Geza|last2=Gloviczki|first2=Peter|editor=John J.

The left external iliac vein remains medial to the artery along its whole path. The right external iliac vein is medial to the artery, but as it ascends, it runs posterior to it.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

The external iliac vein is crossed by the [[ureter]] and internal iliac artery which both extend towards the middle. In males it is crossed by the [[vas deferens]] and in females the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]] and [[ovarian vessels]] cross it. [[Psoas major]] lies to its side, except where the artery intervenes.&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7FVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1228|title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice|last=Delancey|first=John O.L.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=978-0-7020-6851-5|editor=Standring|editor-first=Susan|edition=41st|location=|pages=1221–1236|chapter=73, True pelvis, pelvic floor and perineum|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external iliac vein may have one valve, but often has no valves.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

In addition to pubic veins, the main tributaries of the external iliac veins are the [[inferior epigastric veins]] and the [[deep circumflex iliac vein]].&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

==Clinical significance and history==
In 1967, Cockett noted anatomical variations which predisposed to compression of the external iliac vein, amongst other veins. Although less common than [[May-Thurner syndrome]], it is being progressively documented due to modern imaging methods. Compression of the left external iliac vein by the right common iliac artery or left hypogastric artery can occur as it crosses over the vein into the pelvis. The right external iliac vein can similarly be compressed. Such compressions may contribute to [[deep vein thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="Chaar2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeRubertis|first1=Brian|last2=Patel|first2=Rhasheet|editor=Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar|title=Current Management of Venous Diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2dCDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-65226-9|pages=464–465|chapter=35, May-Thurner Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to develop or [[agenesis]] of the external iliac vein has been described in association with [[Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome]] &lt;ref name=":Gray2016"/&gt;

'''Fiction writing''' is the composition of non-factual prose texts. Fictional writing often is produced as a story meant to entertain or convey an author's point of view. The result of this may be a [[short story]], [[novel]], [[novella]], [[screenplay]], or [[drama]], which are all types (though not the only types) of fictional writing styles. Different types of [[author]]s practice  fictional writing, including [[novelists]], [[playwrights]], [[short story writers]], [[dramatists]] and [[screenwriters]].

==Categories of prose fiction ==
{{main|Fiction#Categories of fiction}}

===Genre fiction===
A [[genre]] is the subject matter or category that writers use. For instance, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[mystery fiction]] are genres. [[Genre fiction]] also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specific [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=10&amp;id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction is storytelling driven by plot, as opposed to literary fiction, which focuses more on theme and character. Genre fiction, or popular fiction, is written to appeal to a large audience and it sells more primarily because it is more commercialised. An example is [[Twilight (novel series)|the ''Twilight'' series]] which may sell more than  [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', because the "Twilight" novels deal with elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] – romance and vampires.

===Literary fiction===
[[Literary fiction]] is [[Fiction|fictional works]] that hold [[literary merit]],  that is to say, they are works that offer [[social commentary]], or [[political criticism]], or focus on aspect of the [[human condition]].

Literary fiction is usually contrasted with, popular, commercial, or [[genre fiction]]. Some have described the difference between them in terms of analysing reality (literary) rather than escaping reality (popular). The contrast between these two categories of fiction is [[Western canon#Debate|controversial]] among some critics and scholars.

==Elements of fiction==
===Character===
[[File:American author Jenna Blum photographed by Marcia Perez.jpg|150px|thumb|Author [[Jenna Blum]] described the process of creating a character: "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on the string, and the next thing you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth."&lt;ref name=JennaBlum3&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 8, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, “...a character who is made out of whole cloth...”&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''[[Characterization]]''' is one of the five elements of fiction, along with plot, setting, theme, and writing style.  A '''[[fictional character|character]]''' is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any persona, identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.

Characters may be of several types:
*'''Point-of-view character''': the character by whom the story is viewed. The point-of-view character may or may not also be the main character in the story.
*'''[[Protagonist]]''': the main character of a story
*'''[[Antagonist]]''': the character who stands in opposition to the protagonist
*'''Minor character''': a character that interacts with the protagonist. They help the story move along.
*'''[[Foil (literature)|Foil character]]''':  a (usually minor) character who has traits opposed to those of the main character

===Plot===
The '''[[plot (narrative)|plot]]''', or storyline, is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. Starting with the initiating event, then the rising action, conflict, climax, falling action, and ending possibly with a resolution.

Plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response and has a beginning, a middle, and an ending.

The climax of the novel consists of a single action-packed sentence in which the conflict (problem) of the novel is resolved. This sentence comes towards the end of the novel. The main part of the action should come before the climax.

Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and sequel. A scene is a unit of drama—where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the sequel—an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath.

===Setting===
'''[[Setting (fiction)|Setting]]''' is the locale and time of a story. The setting is often a real place, but may be a fictitious city or country within our own world; a different planet; or an alternate universe, which may or may not have similarities with our own universe.  Sometimes setting is referred to as '''[[Social environment|milieu]]''', to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. It is basically where and when the story takes place.

===Theme===
'''[[Theme (literary)|Theme]]''' is what the author is trying to tell the reader. For example, the belief in the ultimate good in people, or that things are not always what they seem. This is often referred to as the "moral of the story." Some fiction contains advanced themes like morality, or the value of life, whereas other stories have no theme, or a very shallow one.

===Style===
[[Style (fiction)|Style]] includes the multitude of choices fiction writers make, consciously or not, in the process of writing a story. It encompasses not only the big-picture, strategic choices such as point of view and choice of [[Narration|narrator]], but also tactical choices of grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence and paragraph length and structure, tone, the use of imagery, chapter selection, titles, etc. In the process of creating a story, these choices meld to become the writer's voice, his or her own unique style.

For each piece of fiction, the author makes many choices, consciously or subconsciously, which combine to form the writer's unique style. The components of style are numerous, but include point of view, choice of narrator, fiction-writing mode, person and tense, grammar, punctuation, word usage, sentence length and structure, paragraph length and structure, tone, imagery, chapter usage, and title selection.

====Narrator====
The '''[[Narration|narrator]]''' is the story teller. The main character in the book can also be the narrator.

====Point of view====
[[Point of view (literature)|Point of view]] is the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated. Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tone====
The [[tone (literature)|tone]] of a literary work expresses the writer's attitude toward or feelings about the subject matter and audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suspension of disbelief====
'''[[Suspension of disbelief]]''' is the reader's temporary acceptance of story elements as believable, regardless of how implausible they may seem in real life.

==Authors' views on writing==
Ernest Hemingway wrote "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Poore, ''New York Times'', "Hemingway's Quality Built On a Stern Apprenticeship", ?, ?1954, p. ?)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Stephen King]], in his [[non-fiction]], part autobiographical, part self-help writing memoir, ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft]]'', he gives readers helpful advice on honing their craft: "Description begins in the writer's imagination, but should finish in the reader's."{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

==Creative Writing 101: According to Kurt Vonnegut==
[[Kurt Vonnegut]] the author of praised novels ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', and ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'', has given his readers, from his short story collection, ''[[Bagombo Snuff Box]]'', eight rules on how to write a successful story. The list can be found in the Introduction of the collection.

"Now lend me your ears. Here is Creative Writing 101:

#Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
#Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
#Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
#Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
#Start as close to the end as possible.
#Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
#Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
#Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages."

{{Frankfurt School}}
The '''Frankfurt School''' ({{lang-de|Frankfurter Schule}}) is a school of [[social theory]] and philosophy associated in part with the [[Institute for Social Research]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Founded during the [[interwar period]], the School consisted of [[Western Marxist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ "Critical Theory" on Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; dissidents uncomfortable with existing [[capitalist]], [[fascist]] or [[communist]] systems. Many of these theorists believed that traditional theory could not adequately explain the turbulent and unexpected development of capitalist societies in the 20th century. Critical of both capitalism and [[Marxism–Leninism|Soviet socialism]], their writings pointed to the possibility of an alternative path to [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980). ''Introduction to critical theory: Horkheimer to Habermas''. University of California Press, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists were sometimes only loosely affiliated, and some authors point out that the "Frankfurt Circle" was neither a philosophical school nor a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following Marx, they were concerned with the conditions that allow for [[social change]] and the establishment of rational institutions.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Their emphasis on the [[Critical theory#In social theory|"critical" component of theory]] was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]] by returning to Kant's [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in [[German idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[Dialectic#Modern philosophy|dialectic]] and [[Contradiction#Dialectical materialism|contradiction]] as inherent properties of human reality.

Since the 1960s, Frankfurt School's critical theory has increasingly been guided by [[Jürgen Habermas|Jürgen Habermas's]] work on [[Communicative rationality|communicative reason]], linguistic [[intersubjectivity]] and what Habermas calls "the philosophical discourse of [[Modernity#In sociological thought|modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theorists such as [[Raymond Geuss]] and [[Nikolas Kompridis]] have voiced opposition to Habermas, holding that he has undermined the aspirations for social change that originally gave purpose to critical theory's various projects—for example the problem of what [[reason]] should mean, the analysis and enlargement of "conditions of possibility" for social [[emancipation]] and the critique of modern capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006). ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Institute for Social Research===
{{Main|Institute for Social Research}}
{{Marxism|Variants}}
The term "Frankfurt School" arose informally to describe the thinkers affiliated or merely associated with the Frankfurt [[Institute for Social Research]]; it is not the title of any specific position or institution ''per se'', and few of these theorists used the term themselves. The Institute for Social Research (''Institut für Sozialforschung'') was founded in 1923 by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist legal and political professor at the [[University of Vienna]],&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;Corradetti, Claudio (2011). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/ "The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory"], Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Originally published: 21 October 2011).
&lt;/ref&gt; as an adjunct of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]; it was the first Marxist-oriented research center affiliated with a major German university.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; However, the school can trace its earliest roots back to [[Felix Weil]], who used money from his father's grain business to finance the ''Institut''.

Weil (1898–1975), a young Marxist, had written his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] (published by [[Karl Korsch]]) on the practical problems of implementing socialism. With the hope of bringing different trends of Marxism together, Weil organized a week-long symposium (the ''Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche'') in 1922 in [[Ilmenau]], [[Thuringia]], a meeting attended by [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]], [[Friedrich Pollock]] and others. The event was so successful that Weil set about erecting a building and funding salaries for a permanent institute. Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education that the Director of the Institute would be a full professor from the state system, so that the ''Institut'' would have the status of a University institution.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"&gt;"The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory", [http://www.marxists.org/subject/frankfurt-school/index.htm Marxist Internet Archive] (Retrieved 12 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Lukács and Karl Korsch both attended the ''Arbeitswoche'', which had included a study of Korsch's ''Marxism and Philosophy,'' but both were too committed to political activity and party membership to join the ''Institut'', though Korsch participated in publishing ventures for a number of years. Lukács 1923 work ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' was probably a major inspiration for the work of the Frankfurt School; his later repudiation of the work, required by the Soviet Union, demonstrated the value of independence from the [[Communist Party]] for genuine theoretical work.&lt;ref name="Marxist Internet Archive"/&gt;

The philosophical tradition now referred to as the "Frankfurt School" is perhaps particularly associated with [[Max Horkheimer]] (philosopher, sociologist and social psychologist), who took over as the institute's director in 1930 and recruited many of the school's most talented theorists, including [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), [[Erich Fromm]] (psychoanalyst), and [[Herbert Marcuse]] (philosopher).&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

===German prewar context===
The political turmoil of [[Weimar Republic|Germany's troubled interwar years]] greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly influenced by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe]] (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'', which showed the continuity with [[Hegelianism]] that underlay Marx's thought.

As the growing influence of National Socialism became ever more threatening, its founders decided to prepare to move the Institute out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by Helmut Dubiel in ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, the Institute left Germany for [[Geneva]], before moving to [[New York City]] in 1935, where it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]]. Its journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' was accordingly renamed ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science''. It was at this moment that much of its important work began to emerge, having gained a favorable reception within American and English [[academia]]. Horkheimer, Adorno and Pollock eventually resettled in [[West Germany]] in the early 1950s, although Marcuse, Lowenthal, Kirchheimer and others chose to remain in the United States. It was only in 1953 that the Institute was formally re-established in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorists===
{{See also|List of critical theorists}}
Which "theorists" to include in what is now called the "Frankfurt School" may vary among different scholars. Indeed, the title of "school" can often be misleading, as the Institute's members did not always form a series of tightly woven, complementary projects. Some scholars have therefore limited their view of the Frankfurt School to Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Lowenthal and Pollock.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980, p. 15"/&gt; However, most pre-war theorists can be considered as having shared a very similar paradigm. Most of the members of the Institute for Social Research were of [[Jewish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson, James Gordon (2005), ''Habermas: A Very Short Introduction'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was initially part of the School's inner circle, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is generally considered as the first to have diverged from Horkheimer's research program, thus giving rise to a new generation of [[critical theory|critical theorists]].

Early members of the Frankfurt School were:

*[[Max Horkheimer]]
*[[Theodor W. Adorno]]
*[[Herbert Marcuse]]
*[[Friedrich Pollock]]
*[[Erich Fromm]]
*[[Otto Kirchheimer]]
*[[Leo Löwenthal]]
*[[Franz Leopold Neumann]]
*[[Henryk Grossman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Rick ''Henryk Grossman and the Recovery of Marxism'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

People who were associated with the Institute or its theorists include:

*[[Siegfried Kracauer]]
*[[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]]
*[[Walter Benjamin]]

Later theorists with roots in Frankfurt School critical theory include:

*[[Jürgen Habermas]]
*[[Claus Offe]]
*[[Axel Honneth]]
*[[Oskar Negt]]
*[[Alfred Schmidt (philosopher)|Alfred Schmidt]]
*[[Albrecht Wellmer]]

==Theoretical work==
===Critical theory and the critique of ideology===
The Frankfurt School's work cannot be addressed without understanding the objectives of critical theory. Initially outlined by [[Max Horkheimer]] in his ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937), critical theory may be defined as a self-conscious [[social]] critique that is aimed at change and emancipation through enlightenment and that does not cling dogmatically to its own doctrinal assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Geuss, Raymond (1981). ''The idea of a critical theory: Habermas and the Frankfurt school''. Cambridge University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"&gt;Carr, Adrian (2000). "Critical theory and the management of change in organizations". In: ''Journal of Organizational Change Management'', 13, 3, p. 208–220&lt;/ref&gt; The original aim of critical theory was to analyze the true significance of "the ruling understandings" generated in bourgeois society, in order to show how they {{em|misrepresented}} actual human interaction in the real world, and in so doing functioned to {{em|justify}} or {{em|legitimize}} the domination of people by capitalism. A certain sort of story (a narrative) was provided to explain what was happening in society, but the story concealed as much as it revealed. The Frankfurt theorists generally assumed that their task was mainly to interpret the areas of society Marx had not dealt with, especially in the [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of society.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Jay, ''The Dialectical Imagination. A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''. London: Heinemann, 1973, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horkheimer opposed it to ''traditional theory'', which refers to theory in the positivistic, [[scientism|scientistic]], or purely observational mode—that is, which derives generalizations or "[[scientific law|laws]]" about different aspects of the world. Drawing upon Max Weber, Horkheimer argued that the [[social science]]s differ from the [[natural science]]s inasmuch as generalizations cannot be easily made from so-called experiences because the understanding of a "social" experience itself is always fashioned by ideas that are in the researchers themselves. What the researcher does not realize is that s/he is caught in a historical context in which ideologies shape the thinking; thus, theory would conform to the ideas in the mind of the researcher rather than to the experience itself:

{{quote|The facts which our senses present to us are socially performed in two ways: through the historical character of the object perceived and through the historical character of the perceiving organ. Both are not simply natural; they are shaped by human activity, and yet the individual perceives himself as receptive and passive in the act of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976). "Traditional and critical theory". In: Connerton, P (Eds), ''Critical Sociology: Selected Readings'', Penguin, Harmondsworth, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Horkheimer, approaches to understanding in the social sciences cannot simply imitate those in the natural sciences. Although various theoretical approaches would come close to breaking out of the ideological constraints that restricted them, such as positivism, [[pragmatism]], [[neo-Kantianism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], Horkheimer argued that they failed because all were subject to a "logico-mathematical" prejudice that separates theoretical activity from actual life (meaning that all these schools sought to find a logic that always remains true, independently of and without consideration for ongoing human activities). According to Horkheimer, the appropriate response to this dilemma is the development of a critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen, D. (1996). "Critical theory and philosophy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p .18&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem, Horkheimer argued, is [[epistemology|epistemological]]: we should reconsider not merely the scientist but the knowing individual in general.&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[orthodox Marxism]], which merely applies a ready-made "template" to both critique and action, critical theory seeks to be self-critical and rejects any pretensions to [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. Critical theory defends the primacy of neither matter (materialism) nor consciousness ([[idealism]]), and argues that both epistemologies distort reality to the benefit, eventually, of some small group. What critical theory attempts to do is to place itself outside of philosophical strictures and the confines of existing structures. However, as a way of thinking and "recovering" humanity's self-knowledge, critical theory often looks to Marxism for its methods and tools.&lt;ref name="Carr, Adrian 2000 p. 208-220"/&gt;

Horkheimer maintained that critical theory should be directed at the totality of society in its [[Zeitgeist|historical specificity]] (i.e., how it came to be configured at a specific point in time), just as it should improve understanding of society by integrating all the major social sciences, including geography, economics, sociology, history, political science, anthropology, and psychology. While critical theory must at all times be self-critical, Horkheimer insisted that a theory is critical only if it is explanatory. Critical theory must, therefore, combine practical and normative thinking to "explain what is wrong with current social reality, identify actors to change it, and provide clear norms for criticism and practical goals for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Bohman, J (1996). "Critical theory and democracy". In: Rasmussen, D. (Eds), ''The Handbook of Critical Theory'', Blackwell, Oxford, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas traditional theory can only mirror and explain reality as it presently is, critical theory's purpose is to {{em|change}} it; in Horkheimer's words the goal of critical theory is "the emancipation of human beings from the circumstances that enslave them".&lt;ref&gt;Horkheimer, Max (1976), p. 219 (see also p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt School theorists explicitly linked up with the critical philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], in which the term ''[[critique]]'' meant philosophical reflection on the limits of claims made for certain kinds of knowledge and direct connection between such critique and the emphasis on [[Autonomy#Philosophy|moral autonomy]] as opposed to traditionally deterministic and static theories of human action. In an intellectual context defined by dogmatic positivism and scientism on the one hand and dogmatic "[[scientific socialism]]" on the other, critical theorists intended to rehabilitate Marx's ideas through a philosophically critical approach.

Whereas both [[Marxist–Leninist]] and [[social democratic]] orthodox thinkers viewed Marxism as a new kind of positive science, Frankfurt School theorists such as Horkheimer instead based their work on the epistemological base of Marx's work, which presented itself as critique, as in Marx's ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. They thus emphasized that Marx attempted to create a new kind of critical analysis oriented toward the unity of theory and [[praxis (process)|revolutionary practice]] rather than a new kind of positive science. Critique, in this Marxian sense, means taking the ideology of a society (for example, the belief in [[individual freedom]] or [[free market]] capitalism) and critiquing it by comparing it with a posited social reality of that very society (for example, [[social inequality]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]). Frankfurt School theorists grounded this on the dialectical methodology established by Hegel and Marx.

===Dialectical method===
The Institute also attempted to reformulate dialectics as a concrete method. The use of such a dialectical method can be traced back to the philosophy of Hegel, who conceived dialectic as the tendency of a notion to pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between its inherent contradictory aspects.&lt;ref name="dialectic1"&gt;dialectic. (2009). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved 19 December 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161174/dialectic]&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and change in time, as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.&lt;ref name="dialectic1" /&gt;

History, according to Hegel, proceeds and evolves in a dialectical manner: the present embodies the rational [[Aufheben|sublation]], or "synthesis", of past contradictions. History may thus be seen as an intelligible process (which Hegel referred to as {{lang|de|[[Geist#The Weltgeist|Weltgeist]]}}), which is the [[Idea of Progress|moving towards a specific condition]]—the rational realization of human freedom.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford"&gt;Little, D. (2007). "Philosophy of History", The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (Sun 18 February 2007), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/#HegHis]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Problem of future contingents|considerations about the future]] were of no interest to Hegel,&lt;ref&gt;"When philosophy paints its grey on grey, then has a shape of life grown old. (...) The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk" – Hegel, G. W. F. (1821). {{lang|de|[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts]]}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hegel's philosophy, and in particular his political philosophy, purports to be the rational formulation of a definite historical period, and Hegel refuses to look further ahead into the future." – Peĺczynski, Z. A. (1971). ''Hegel's political philosophy—problems and perspectives: a collection of new essays'', CUP Archive. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JEI4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 Google Print, p. 200]&lt;/ref&gt; for whom philosophy cannot be [[Normative#Philosophy|prescriptive]] because it understands only in hindsight. The study of history is thus limited to the description of past and present realities.&lt;ref name="HegelStanford" /&gt; Hence for Hegel and his [[Right Hegelians|successors]], dialectics inevitably lead to the approval of the [[status quo]]—indeed, Hegel's philosophy served as a justification for [[Christian theology]] and the [[Prussia|Prussian state]].

This was fiercely criticized by Marx and the [[Young Hegelians]], who argued that Hegel had gone too far in defending his abstract conception of "absolute Reason" and had failed to notice the "real"—i.e. {{em|undesirable}} and {{em|irrational}}—life conditions of the [[Proletariat|working class]]. By turning Hegel's idealist dialectics upside-down, Marx advanced his own theory of [[dialectical materialism]], arguing that "it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx (1859), Preface to {{lang|de|[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's theory follows a [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] and [[Marxist geography|space]],&lt;ref&gt;Soja, E. (1989). Postmodern Geographies. London: Verso. (esp. pp. 76–93)&lt;/ref&gt; where the development of the productive forces is seen as the primary motive force for historical change, and according to which the social and material [[Contradictions#Dialectical materialism|contradictions]] inherent to capitalism inevitably lead to its negation—thereby replacing capitalism with a new rational form of society: [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor=Jonathan Wolff, Ph.D. |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Karl Marx |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ |access-date=17 September 2009 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher=Stanford |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx thus extensively relied on a form of dialectical analysis. This method—to know the truth by uncovering the contradictions in presently predominant ideas and, by extension, in the social relations to which they are linked—exposes the underlying struggle between opposing forces. For Marx, it is only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e., [[class consciousness]]) of such opposing forces, in a struggle for power, that individuals can liberate themselves and change the existing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Robert M. "Human Communication in the Critical Theory Tradition", University of Calgary, [http://people.ucalgary.ca/~rseiler/critical.htm Online Publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came to realize that a dialectical method could only be adopted {{em|if it could be applied to itself}}—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct previous false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the [[historicism]] and materialism of [[orthodox Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. (1994) ''The Frankfurt School: critical assessments'', Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 208 (See also pp. 199–202)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the material tensions and [[class struggle]]s of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same [[Communist revolution|revolutionary potential]] within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.

Contrary to orthodox Marxist [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], which solely seeks to implement an unchangeable and narrow idea of "communism" into practice, critical theorists held that praxis and theory, following the dialectical method, should be interdependent and should mutually influence each other. When Marx famously stated in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it", his real idea was that philosophy's only validity was in how it informed action. Frankfurt School theorists would correct this by arguing that when action fails, then the theory guiding it must be reviewed. In short, socialist philosophical thought must be given the ability to criticize itself and "overcome" its own errors. While theory must inform praxis, praxis must also have a chance to inform theory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

|}

Responding to the intensification of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[irrationality]] in an [[advanced capitalist society]], critical theory is a comprehensive, ideology-critical, historically self-reflective body of theory aiming simultaneously to explain domination and point to the possibilities of bringing about a rational, humane, and free society. Frankfurt School critical theorists developed numerous theories of the economic, political, cultural, and psychological domination structures of advanced industrial civilization.

The Institute made major contributions in two areas relating to the possibility of human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s to be rational, i.e., individuals who could act rationally to take charge of their own [[society]] and their own [[history]]. The first consisted of social phenomena previously considered in Marxism as part of the "[[base and superstructure|superstructure]]" or as [[ideology]]: [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[family]] and [[authority]] structures (one of the earliest works published bore the title ''Studies of Authority and the Family''), and the realm of [[aesthetics]] and mass culture. Studies saw a common concern here in the ability of capitalism to destroy the preconditions of critical, revolutionary [[political consciousness]]. This meant arriving at a sophisticated awareness of the depth dimension in which social [[oppression]] sustains itself. It also meant the beginning of critical theory's recognition of ideology as part of the foundations of social structure.

===Critique of Western civilization===
====''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' and ''Minima Moralia''====
The second phase of Frankfurt School critical theory centres principally on two works: [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944) and Adorno's ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951). The authors wrote both works during the Institute's exile in America. While retaining much of a Marxian analysis, in these works critical theory shifted its emphasis from the critique of capitalism to a critique of [[Western civilization]] as a whole, as seen in ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', which uses the  ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a paradigm for their analysis of [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] consciousness. In these works, Horkheimer and Adorno present many themes that have come to dominate the [[social thought]] of recent years; for instance, their exposition of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|domination of nature]] as a central characteristic of [[instrumental rationality]] in Western civilization was made long before [[ecology]] and [[environmentalism]] had become popular concerns.

The analysis of reason now goes one stage further: The [[rationality]] of Western civilization appears as a fusion of domination and technological rationality, bringing all of external and internal nature under the power of the human subject. In the process, however, the subject itself gets swallowed up and no social force analogous to the [[proletariat]] can be identified that enables the subject to emancipate itself. Hence the subtitle of ''Minima Moralia'': "Reflections from Damaged Life". In Adorno's words,

{{quote|For since the overwhelming objectivity of historical movement in its present phase consists so far only in the dissolution of the subject, without yet giving rise to a new one, individual experience necessarily bases itself on the old subject, now historically condemned, which is still for-itself, but no longer in-itself. The subject still feels sure of its autonomy, but the nullity demonstrated to subjects by the concentration camp is already overtaking the form of subjectivity itself.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Minima Moralia: Reflections on a Damaged Life,'' Verso (2006), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Consequently, at a time when it appears that reality itself has become the basis for ideology, the greatest contribution that critical theory can make is to explore the dialectical contradictions of individual subjective experience on the one hand, and to preserve the truth of theory on the other. Even dialectical progress is put into doubt: "its truth or untruth is not inherent in the method itself, but in its intention in the historical process." This intention must be oriented toward integral freedom and happiness: "The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]]." Adorno goes on to distance himself from the "optimism" of orthodox Marxism: "beside the demand thus placed on thought, the question of the reality or unreality of redemption [i.e. human emancipation] itself hardly matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2006), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a sociological point of view, both Horkheimer's and Adorno's works contain a certain ambivalence concerning the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence that gave rise to the "pessimism" of the new critical theory over the possibility of human emancipation and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. W., with Max Horkheimer. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Trans. Edmund Jephcott. Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; This ambivalence was rooted, of course, in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of [[National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[mass culture]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology.&lt;ref&gt;"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions" – Habermas, Jürgen. (1987). ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''. Trans. Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 116.{{pb}}See also: Dubiel, Helmut. (1985). ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory''. Trans. Benjamin Gregg. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London.&lt;/ref&gt; For Adorno and Horkheimer, [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]] of society"—a tension that, according to traditional [[Marxist theory]], constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously "free" market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and "irrevocable" [[private property]] of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]] in contemporary Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;"[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." – Horkheimer, Max and Theodor Adorno. (2002). ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination.

Of this second "phase" of the Frankfurt School, philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis writes that:

{{quote|According to the now canonical view of its history, Frankfurt School critical theory began in the 1930s as a fairly confident interdisciplinary and materialist research program, the general aim of which was to connect normative social criticism to the emancipatory potential latent in concrete historical processes. Only a decade or so later, however, having revisited the premises of their philosophy of history, Horkheimer and Adorno's ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' steered the whole enterprise, provocatively and self-consciously, into a skeptical cul-de-sac. As a result they got stuck in the irresolvable dilemmas of the "philosophy of the subject," and the original program was shrunk to a negativistic practice of critique that eschewed the very normative ideals on which it implicitly depended.&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kompridis argues that this "sceptical cul-de-sac" was arrived at with "a lot of help from the once unspeakable and unprecedented barbarity of European fascism," and could not be gotten out of without "some well-marked [exit or] {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, showing the way out of the ever-recurring nightmare in which Enlightenment hopes and Holocaust horrors are fatally entangled." However, this {{lang|de|Ausgang}}, according to Kompridis, would not come until later – purportedly in the form of Jürgen Habermas's work on the intersubjective bases of [[communicative rationality]].&lt;ref name="Kompridis, Nikolas. 2006, p. 256"/&gt;

====Philosophy of music====
Adorno, a trained classical pianist, wrote ''The Philosophy of Modern Music'' (1949), in which he, in essence, polemicizes against [[popular music]]―because it has become part of the culture industry of [[Advanced capitalism|advanced capitalist society]]{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and the [[false consciousness]] that contributes to social domination. He argued that radical art and music may preserve the truth by capturing the reality of human suffering. Hence:

{{quote|What radical music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of man [...] The seismographic registration of traumatic shock becomes, at the same time, the technical structural law of music. It forbids continuity and development. Musical language is polarized according to its extreme; towards gestures of shock resembling bodily convulsions on the one hand, and on the other towards a crystalline standstill of a human being whom anxiety causes to freeze in her tracks [...] Modern music sees absolute oblivion as its goal. It is the surviving message of despair from the shipwrecked.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W. (2003) ''The Philosophy of Modern Music''. Translated into English by Anne G. Mitchell and Wesley V. Blomster. Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view of [[modern art]] as producing truth only through the negation of traditional aesthetic form and traditional norms of beauty because they have become ideological is characteristic of Adorno and of the Frankfurt School generally. It has been criticized by those who do not share its conception of modern society as a false totality that renders obsolete traditional conceptions and images of beauty and harmony.

In particular, Adorno despised [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable". The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a 'fetishized' commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.'&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. ''The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope'' 2010, p. 89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical theory and domination===
====Negative dialectics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
With the growth of advanced industrial society during the [[Cold War]] era, critical theorists recognized that the path of capitalism and history had changed decisively, that the modes of oppression operated differently, and that the industrial [[working class]] no longer remained the determinate negation of capitalism. This led to the attempt to root the dialectic in an absolute method of negativity, as in Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' (1964) and Adorno's ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966). During this period the Institute of Social Research resettled in [[Frankfurt]] (although many of its associates remained in the United States) with the task not merely of continuing its research but of becoming a leading force in the sociological education and [[democratization]] of West Germany. This led to a certain systematization of the Institute's entire accumulation of empirical research and theoretical analysis.

During this period, Frankfurt School critical theory particularly influenced some segments of the [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and leftist thought, particularly the [[New Left]]. Herbert Marcuse has occasionally been described as the theorist or intellectual progenitor of the New Left. Their critique of technology, totality, teleology and (occasionally) civilization is an influence on [[anarcho-primitivism]]. Their work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on [[popular culture]] and scholarly [[popular culture studies]].

More importantly, however, the Frankfurt School attempted to define the fate of reason in the new historical period. While Marcuse did so through analysis of structural changes in the [[labour (economics)|labor]] process under capitalism and inherent features of the [[methodology]] of [[science]], Horkheimer and Adorno concentrated on a re-examination of the foundation of critical theory. This effort appears in systematized form in Adorno's ''Negative Dialectics'', which tries to redefine dialectics for an era in which "philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed". Negative dialectics expresses the idea of critical thought so conceived that the apparatus of domination cannot co-opt it.

Its central notion, long a focal one for Horkheimer and Adorno, suggests that the [[original sin]] of thought lies in its attempt to eliminate all that is other than thought, the attempt by the subject to devour the object, the striving for [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]. This [[reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] makes thought the accomplice of domination. ''Negative Dialectics'' rescues the "preponderance of the object", not through a naïve [[Epistemological realism|epistemological]] or [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realism]] but through a thought based on [[differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]], [[paradox]], and ruse: a "logic of disintegration". Adorno thoroughly criticizes [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s fundamental [[ontology]], which he thinks reintroduces idealistic and identity-based concepts under the guise of having overcome the philosophical tradition.

''Negative dialectics'' comprises a monument to the end of the tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School had no one to rely on but the individual subject. But, as the [[liberalism|liberal]] capitalist social basis of the autonomous individual receded into the past, the dialectic based on it became more and more abstract.

====Habermas and communicative rationality====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{Main|Jürgen Habermas}}
Habermas's work takes the Frankfurt School's abiding interests in rationality, the human subject, [[democratic socialism]], and the dialectical method and overcomes a set of contradictions that always weakened critical theory: the contradictions between the materialist and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] methods, between Marxian social theory and the [[individualism|individualist]] assumptions of critical [[rationalism]] between technical and social rationalization, and between cultural and psychological phenomena on the one hand and the [[economics|economic]] structure of society on the other.

The Frankfurt School avoided taking a stand on the precise relationship between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of [[social evolution]], while the materialist theory makes sense only as part of a quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory knowledge that is the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.

By locating the conditions of rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in [[Social interaction|interaction]]. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted [[communication]]. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative [[ethics]] as the highest stage in the internal logic of the evolution of ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new [[politics|political]] practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.

==Criticism of Frankfurt School theorists==
===Horkheimer and Adorno's pessimism===
An early criticism, originating from the left, argues that Frankfurt School critical theory is nothing more than a form of "bourgeois idealism" devoid of any actual relation to political practice, and is hence totally isolated from the reality of any ongoing revolutionary movement. This criticism was captured in [[Georg Lukács]]'s phrase "Grand Hotel Abyss" as a syndrome he imputed to the members of the Frankfurt School:

{{quote|A considerable part of the leading German intelligentsia, including Adorno, have taken up residence in the ''Grand Hotel Abyss'' which I described in connection with my critique of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as "a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered."&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, Georg. (1971). ''The Theory of the Novel''. MIT Press, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] equally believed that the school did not live up to Marx's promise of a better future:

{{quote|Marx's own condemnation of our society makes sense. For Marx's theory contains the promise of a better future. But the theory becomes vacuous and irresponsible if this promise is withdrawn, as it is by Adorno and Horkheimer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Karl R. Popper]]: ''Addendum 1974: The Frankfurt School.'' in: ''The Myth of the Framework.'' London New York 1994, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Habermas's solutions: critical theory "between past and future"===
In 2006, Nikolas Kompridis (who undertook a post-doctoral fellowship with Jürgen Habermas) published new criticisms of Habermas's approach to critical theory, calling for a dramatic break with the proceduralist ethics of communicative rationality. He writes:

{{quote|For all its theoretical ingenuity and practical implications, Habermas's reformulation of critical theory is beset by persistent problems of its own... In my view, the depth of these problems indicate just how wrong was Habermas's expectation that the paradigm change to linguistic intersubjectivity would render "objectless" the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', MIT Press, 1987. p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas accused Hegel of creating a conception of reason so "overwhelming" that it solved ''too well'' the problem of modernity's [need for] self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen (1987), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It seems, however, that Habermas has repeated rather than avoided Hegel's mistake, creating a theoretical paradigm so comprehensive that in one stroke it ''also'' solves too well the dilemmas of the philosophy of the subject ''and'' the problem of modernity's self-reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, he writes that:

{{quote|The change of paradigm to linguistic intersubjectivity has been accompanied by a dramatic change in critical theory's self-understanding. The priority given to questions of justice and the normative order of society has remodeled critical theory in the image of liberal theories of justice. While this has produced an important contemporary variant of liberal theories of justice, different enough to be a challenge to liberal theory, but not enough to preserve sufficient continuity with critical theory's past, it has severely weakened the identity of critical theory and inadvertently initiated its premature dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To prevent that dissolution, Kompridis suggests that critical theory should "reinvent" itself as a "possibility-disclosing" enterprise, incorporating Heidegger's controversial insights into [[world disclosure]] and drawing from the sources of normativity that he feels were blocked from critical theory by its recent change of paradigm. Calling for what [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has named a "new department" of reason,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments pp. 12, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; with a possibility-disclosing role that Kompridis calls "[[reflective disclosure]]", Kompridis argues that critical theory must embrace its neglected [[German romanticism|German romantic inheritance]] and once again imagine alternatives to existing social and political conditions, "if it is to have a future worthy of its past."&lt;ref&gt;Kompridis, Nikolas. (2006), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of psychoanalytic categorizations===
In an interview with Casey Blake and [[Christopher Phelps]], historian [[Christopher Lasch]] criticized the Frankfurt School's initial tendencies towards "automatically" rejecting opposing political criticisms on "psychiatric" grounds:

{{quote|''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' had a tremendous influence on [[Richard Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] and other liberal intellectuals, because it showed them how to conduct political criticism in psychiatric categories, to make those categories bear the weight of political criticism. This procedure excused them from the difficult work of judgment and argumentation. Instead of arguing with opponents, they simply dismissed them on psychiatric grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Casey and Christopher Phelps. (1994). "History as social criticism: Conversations with Christopher Lasch", ''Journal of American History'' 80, No. 4 (March), pp. 1310–1332&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Economic and media critiques===
During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticised the rigid and determinist view of popular culture deployed within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that [[EC Comics]] often did contain such cultural critiques.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Barker: ''A Haunt of Fears: The Strange History of the British Horror Comics Campaign'': London: Pluto Press: 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Shuker, Roger Openshaw and Janet Soler: ''Youth, Media and Moral Panic: From Hooligans to Video Nasties'': Palmerston North: Massey University Department of Education: 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] focused on the claim that culture has grown more sophisticated and diverse as a consequence of free markets and the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen, Tyler (1998) "Is Our Culture in Decline?" Cato Policy Report, http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v20n5/culture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon (2010) "The Attack on Imagination," {{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222855/http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conspiracy theory emerged in the late 1990s. It suggested that the Frankfurt School and other marxist theorists were working in a conspiracy to control and stage their own attack on Western society, using [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[multiculturalism]], [[progressive politics]] and [[political correctness]] as their methods.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Bill |title='Cultural Marxism' Catching On |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=August 15, 2003 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930043851/https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching |archivedate=September 30, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind" /&gt; This conspiracy theory is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as [[William S.

In 1999, Lind led the creation of an hour-long program entitled "Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School".&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;

The historian [[Martin Jay]] commented on this phenomenon saying that Lind's original documentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical right-wing sites. These in turn led to a welter of new videos now available on YouTube, which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line. The message is numbingly simplistic: all the ills of modern American culture, from feminism, [[affirmative action]], [[sexual liberation]] and [[gay rights]] to the decay of traditional education and even [[environmentalism]] are ultimately attributable to the insidious influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930's.&lt;ref name="Jay" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heidi Beirich likewise holds that the conspiracy theory is used to [[demonize]] various conservative "[[wikt:bête noire#English|bêtes noires]]" including "feminists, homosexuals, [[secular humanist]]s, multiculturalists, [[Sex education|sex educators]], environmentalists, immigrants, and [[black nationalist]]s".&lt;ref name="PERRY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara (ed.)|last2=Beirich|first2=Heidi|title=Hate crimes [vol.5]|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/?id=M7p6TDR1zwcC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Heidi+Beirich+Cultural+Marxism#v=onepage&amp;q=noires&amp;f=false|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Chip Berlet]], who specializes in the study of [[far-right]] movements, the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found a place within the [[Tea Party movement]] of 2009, with contributions published in the ''[[American Thinker]]'' and ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' highlighted by some Tea Party websites.&lt;ref name="Collectivists"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |title=Collectivists, Communists, Labor Bosses, and Treason: The Tea Parties as Right-Wing Populist Counter-Subversion Panic |author=Berlet, Chip |journal=Critical Sociology |date=July 2012 |volume=38 |pages=565–587 |doi=10.1177/0896920511434750 |issue=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115213944/http://crs.sagepub.com/content/38/4/565.abstract |archivedate=15 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KIMBALL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kimball|first1=Linda|title=Cultural Marxism|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2007/02/cultural_marxism.html|website=American Thinker|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] has reported that William S. Lind in 2002 gave a speech at a [[Holocaust denial]] conference on the topic of Cultural Marxism. In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were "to a man, Jewish", but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the Free Congress Foundation "to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis".&lt;ref name="BERK"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bill|title=Ally of Christian Right Heavyweight Paul Weyrich Addresses Holocaust Denial Conference|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/ally-christian-right-heavyweight-paul-weyrich-addresses-holocaust-denial-conference|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=SPLC 2003|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BILL" /&gt;

Although the theory became more widespread in the late 1990s and through the 2000s, the modern iteration of the theory originated in Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness{{'"}}, published in [[Fidelio (magazine)|''Fidelio Magazine'']] by the [[Schiller Institute]].&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jay |first1=Martin |title=Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe |url=http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm |website=skidmore.edu |publisher=''Salmagundi Magazine'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm |archivedate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schillerinstitute.org"&gt;[http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_91-96/921_frankfurt.html "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness{{'"}}], Schiller Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay (2010) notes that Daniel Estulin's book cites this essay and that [[Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|The Free Congress Foundation's]] program was inspired by it.&lt;/ref&gt; The Schiller Institute, a branch of the [[LaRouche movement]], further promoted the idea in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Minnicino (1994), [http://www.schillerinstitute.org/conf-iclc/1990s/conf_feb_1994_minnicino.html Freud and the Frankfurt School] ([[Schiller Institute]] 1994), part of "Solving the Paradox of Current World History", a conference report published in ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Minnicino article charges that the Frankfurt School promoted [[Modernism]] in [[Modern art|the arts]] as a form of [[cultural pessimism]] and shaped the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (such as the British pop band [[The Beatles]]) after the [[Wandervogel]] of the [[Monte Verità|Ascona commune]].&lt;ref name="schillerinstitute.org" /&gt; According to [[Samuel Moyn]], the fear of "cultural Marxism” is originally "an American contribution to the phantasmagoria of the alt-right", while the theory is "a crude slander, referring to something that does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Alt-Right’s Favorite Meme is 100 Years Old |author=Samuel Moyn |authorlink=Samuel Moyn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/cultural-marxism-anti-semitism.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=sectionfront |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher and political science lecturer Jérôme Jamin has stated that "[n]ext to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy".&lt;ref name="JAMIN"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shekhovtsov |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |last=Jamin |first=Jérôme |title=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate |chapter=Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-1-137-39619-8 |doi=10.1057/9781137396211.0009 |pages=84–103 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor and [[Oxford fellow]] Matthew Feldman has traced the terminology back to the pre-war German concept of [[Cultural Bolshevism]], locating it as part of the [[degeneration theory]] that aided in [[Hitler's rise to power]].&lt;ref name="MATT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew|first1=Feldman|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger (editor)|title=Fascism: Fascism and culture|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-29018-0 |page=343|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOH4yTFvBokC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=Cultural+Marxism|access-date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; William S.

The '''Institutional Analysis and Development framework''' ('''IAD''') was developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American [[political scientist]], also known as the first woman to receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD relates a set of concepts to help in the analysis of collective action problems that involve social structures, positions, and rules. Under the rational choice models, the IAD was devised in an attempt to ''explain and predict'' outcomes by formalising the structures, positions, and rules involved in collective choice problems. Thus, it can be seen as a [[Systematic sampling|systematic method]] to collect policy analysis functions similar to [[analytical technique|analytic technique]] commonly used in [[Physical science|physical]] and [[social science]]s and understand how institution operate and change over a period of time&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael D.

=== Components of the framework ===
[[File:IAD framework diagram.png|thumb|400px|IAD framework diagram]]
Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the regularised interactions in an established social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt; The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation)&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8085.pdf|title=Understanding Institutional Diversity|author=Elinor Ostrom|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831739|location=Princeton|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Krister Andersson|title=Understanding decentralized forest governance: an application of the institutional analysis and development framework|url=http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol2iss1/0507-010.andersson.html|journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The institutional arrangements can be studied by seven rule types (as per below).&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">IBIS-2 is the version 2 of the land-surface model '''Integrated Biosphere Simulator''' (IBIS), which includes several major improvements and additions to the prototype model developed by Foley et al. [1996]. IBIS was designed to explicitly link land surface and hydrological processes, terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, and [[vegetation]] dynamics within a single physically consistent framework &lt;ref&gt;[Kucharik et al. 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBIS Functionality==

The model considers transient changes in vegetation composition and structure in response to environmental change and is, therefore, classified as a [[Dynamic Global Vegetation Model]] ([[DGVM]]) &lt;ref&gt;[Steffeen et al. 1992; Walker, 1994; W. Cramer et al., Dynamic responses of global terrestrial vegetation changes in CO2 and climate, submitted to Global Change Biology, 1999].&lt;/ref&gt; This new version of IBIS has improved representations of land surface physics, plant [[physiology]], canopy [[phenology]], [[plant functional type]] (PFT) differences, and [[carbon]] allocation. Furthermore, IBIS-2 includes a new belowground biogeochemistry submodel, which is coupled to detritus production (litterfall and fine root turnover). All process are organized in a hierarchical framework and operate at different time steps, ranging from 60 min to 1 year. Such an approach allows for explicit coupling among ecological, biophysical, and physiological processes occurring on different timescales.

==IBIS Structure==

The land surface module is based on the land surface transfer model (LSX) package of Thompson and Pollard,&lt;ref&gt;[1995a,b]&lt;/ref&gt; and simulates the energy, water, carbon, and momentum balance of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. The model represents two vegetation canopies (e.g., trees versus shrubs and grasses), eight soil layers, and three layers of snow (when required). The solar radiative transfer scheme of IBIS-2 has been simplified in comparison with LSX and IBIS-1; sunlit and shaded fractions of the canopies are no longer treated separately. The model now follows the approach of Sellers et al. [1986] and Bonan [1995]. Infrared radiation is simulated as if each vegetation layer is a semitransparent plane; canopy emissivity depends on foliage density. Another difference between IBIS-2 and IBIS-1 and LSX, is that IBIS-2 uses an empirical linear function of wind speed to estimate turbulent transfer between the soil surface and the lower vegetation canopy, and IBIS-1 and LSX use a logarithmic wind profile. The total [[evapotranspiration]] from the land surface is treated as the sum of three water vapor fluxes: evaporation from the soil surface, evaporation of water intercepted by vegetation canopies, and canopy transpiration.

IBIS simulates the variations of heat and moisture in the soil. The eight layers are described in terms of soil temperature, volumetric water content and ice content.&lt;ref&gt;[Pollard and Thompson, 1995; Foley et al. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; All the process occurring in the soil are influenced by the soil texture and amount of organic matter within the soil. One difference from the physiological processes in previous version of the model is that IBIS-1 calculates the maximum [[Rubisco]] carboxylation capacity (Vm) by optimizing the net assimilation of carbon by the leaf.&lt;ref&gt;[Haxeltine and Prentice, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS-2 prescribes constant values of Vm for the plant functional typed (PFT). To scale [[photosynthesis]] and transpiration from the leaf level to canopy level, IBIS-2 assumes that the net photosynthesis within the canopy is proportional to the APAR within it.

==Soil Biogeochemistry==

In the original version of IBIS &lt;ref&gt;[Foley et al. 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; there was no explicit below ground biogeochemistry model to complete flow of carbon between the vegetation, detritus, and [[soil organic matter]] pools. IBIS-2 includes a new soil biogeochemistry module.&lt;ref&gt;[Kucharik et al., submitted manuscript, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4422">An '''ionospheric heater''', or an ionospheric HF pump facility, is a powerful radio wave transmitter with an array of [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s which is used for research of plasma turbulence, the [[ionosphere]] and upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=LeyserWong&gt;Powerful electromagnetic waves for active environmental research in geospace, by T. B. Leyser and A. Y. Wong (Reviews of Geophysics, Vol. 47, RG1001, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; These transmitters operate in the high frequency (HF) range (3-30&amp;nbsp;MHz) at which radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere back to the ground. With such facilities a range of plasma turbulence phenomena can be excited in a semi-controlled fashion from the ground, during conditions when the ionosphere is naturally quiet and not perturbed by for example aurora. This stimulus-response type of research complements passive observations of naturally excited phenomena to learn about the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.

The plasma turbulence phenomena that are studied include different types on nonlinear wave interactions, in which different waves in the plasma couple and interact with the transmitted radio wave, formation and self organization of filamentary plasma structures, as well as electron acceleration. The turbulence is diagnosed by for example [[incoherent scatter]] radar, by detecting the weak electromagnetic emissions from the turbulence and optical emissions. The optical emissions result from the excitation of atmospheric atoms and molecules by electrons that have been accelerated in the plasma turbulence. As this process is the same as for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], the optical emission excited by HF waves have sometimes been referred to as artificial aurora, although sensitive cameras are needed to detect these emissions, which is not the case for the real aurora.

Ionospheric HF pump facilities need to be sufficiently powerful to provide the possibility for plasma turbulence studies, although any radio wave that propagates in the ionosphere affects it by heating the electrons. That radio waves affect the ionosphere was discovered already in the 1930s with the [[Luxemburg-Gorky effect|Luxemburg effect]]. Although the research facilities need to have powerful transmitters, the power flux in the ionosphere for the most powerful facility (HAARP) is below 0.03 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007235012/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives an energy density in the ionosphere that is less than 1/100 of the thermal energy density of the ionospheric plasma itself.&lt;ref name=LeyserWong /&gt; The power flux may also be compared with the solar flux at the Earth's surface of about 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. During aurora generally no ionospheric effects can be observed with the HF pump facilities as the radio wave power is strongly absorbed by the naturally heated ionosphere.

The '''''Journal of Biblical Literature''''' ('''''JBL''''') is one of three [[academic journals]] published by the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL).
First published in 1881, ''JBL'' is the flagship journal of the field. ''JBL'' is published quarterly and includes scholarly articles, critical notes, and book reviews by members of the Society. 
''JBL'' is available on line as well as in print:

''JBL'' has a moving window of Open Access. Aside from the current issue, the past three years of ''JBL'' are freely available to the public in PDF form, after registering on the SBL website. Previous issues, back to 1881, are available in the JSTOR Arts and Sciences III collection."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kinbar, [http://sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 'Open Access and the SBL',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014152635/http://www.sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 |date=2006-10-14 }} ''[[SBL Forum]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was originally published under the title ''Journal of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis''. The current name was adopted with volume 9 (1890).

At the fourth meeting, on 29 December 1881, the SBL council voted to print 500 copies of a journal, including the full text of papers read at the society's annual June meetings.&lt;ref&gt;
''JBL'' '''50''' (1931): xxiv-xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;

''JBL'' was, at first, an annual serial, from 1882 to 1905 (though two serials appeared in each of 1886 and 1887). ''JBL'' became semiannual from 1906 to 1911, and has been quarterly since 1912 (with a hiatus in 1915 and exceptional years with only two serials).&lt;ref name="Scriptures" /&gt;

In 1916, the SBL secretary passed on to the members a communication, from the Third Assistant Postmaster General of the United States, refusing to give the ''JBL'' the second-class rate discount for scholarly journals, "on the ground that it was not scientific."&lt;ref name=Scriptures&gt;Saunders, Ernest W., 'Journal', in chapter 8, [http://www.sbl-site.org/SSchapter8.aspx 'Of the Making of Books'], of ''Searching the Scriptures: A History of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1880-1980'', (Chico: Scholars' Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Journal of the Society for Biblical Literature in the United States was published in Leipzig through World War I down to the Nazi period—yet for the most part this feature showed up only when it became a problem for delivery after Germany began to be devastated after 1916."&lt;ref&gt;
Martin E. Marty, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260316 Review of ''Searching the Scriptures'',] ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''103''' (1984): 85-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], an English [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained minister]] and [[Egyptology|egyptologist]] was editor of a journal also called ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', published from London prior to the establishment of SBL and its journal.

A '''kerb crawler''' (or [[curb (road)|curb]] crawler) is a person who drives around areas known for [[street prostitution]] [[soliciting]] [[prostitution|prostitutes]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The act is known as "kerb crawling" because the person will typically drive very slowly along the [[kerb (road)|kerbside]]. 

Where prostitution is illegal, kerb crawlers are widely regarded as a [[public nuisance]]: they help keep street prostitutes in business in [[red-light district]]s and often [[solicit]] [[pedestrian]]s who are not prostitutes for sex. As a result, kerb-crawling is illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s.

[[Sting operation]]s in which [[undercover police]] wait for kerb crawlers to [[proposition]] them are a common method for tackling kerb crawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Amelia |title=The policewomen who pose as prostitutes to trap kerb crawlers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/15/ukcrime.gender |website=The Guardian |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=15 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerb crawling is illegal in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution laws around the world |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/128029/at-a-glance-prostitution-laws/ |website=Global News |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="cps" /&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Federal and State Prostitution Laws and Related Punishments |url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000119 |website=prostitution.procon.org |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Ian |title=Research Projects |url=https://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/research-projects/prostitution |website=Imagining Urban Futures |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution in India and it's legal analysis |url=http://www.lawyersclubindia.com/articles/Prostitution-in-India-and-it-s-legal-analysis--9151.asp |website=Lawyers Club India |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police may also collect [[Vehicle registration plate|licence-plate number]]s of vehicles that appear to be kerb crawling and may contact their [[Vehicle registration|registered]] owners. 

Following the recommendations of the 1984 [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] report ''Prostitution on the Street'', the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Sexual Offences Act 1985]] introduced an offence of kerb crawling to persistently solicit women for the purposes of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Offences Act 1985 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/44/pdfs/ukpga_19850044_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=29 November 2018 |quote=Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulnerable"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Phil |last2=Scoular |first2=Jane |editor1-last=Canter |editor1-first=D |editor2-last=Ioannou |editor2-first=M |editor3-last=Youngs |editor3-first=D |title=Safer Sex in the City: The Experience and Management of Street Prostitution |date=2010 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=0754626156 |pages=135-153 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1057567710373119 |language=en |chapter=Making the vulnerable more vulnerable?

==John schools==
{{main|John school}}
A John school is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a [[diversion program]] for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for [[solicitation|soliciting]] the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation.

Whether the John school is a [[diversion program]] or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within [[red light districts]]. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with [[prostitution]], the [[sexually transmitted disease]] risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1998-11/s-boddy.html "John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution"] by Sharon Boddy, ''Peace and Environment News'', November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519,hunter,63812,5.html "School for Johns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918062417/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519%2Chunter%2C63812%2C5.html |date=2007-09-18 }} by Aina Hunter, ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medstar Television Inc.''' is a television production company based in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

==History &amp; Founding==
Medstar was incorporated in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1981 by Paul Dowling and William Ferretti to produce medical news and health information. &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Medstar financed, produced and distributed all of its own productions. ([http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters Health Matters: Independents Prescription Works])

==Productions==
One of its first was ''Health Matters'', a program on health and lifestyle issues, produced in cooperation with hospitals throughout the United States, which sponsor the program in their local areas with local and national content, along the same lines as ''[[PM Magazine]]''. ''Health Matters'' was [[television syndication|syndicated]] to various commercial and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations during the 1980s.  &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1987-01-18/business/2567668_1_medstar-communications-health-matters-television&lt;/ref&gt;

Medstar later expanded to produce two medical news products, "MedstarSource" and "MedstarAdvances" syndicated to commercial television stations in the United States.  Production of these segments ended in August 2011.

In 1990 Medstar began to produce programming for cable television including the [[Discovery Channel]], [[HBO]] and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]].

In 1995 the company created the ''Medical Detectives'' series on [[forensic science]], which premiered on TLC in April 1995. ([https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006447/ IMDB program listing])  It was the first reality based forensic series on television and used a 'murder mystery' approach to documentary storytelling. In 2000 the Medical Detectives series moved to the CourtTV network (now [[TruTV]]) where it was re-titled ''[[Forensic Files]]'' and quickly became the networks highest rated television series.  Internationally, the series was sold to stations and networks in over 142 countries where it remains enormously popular.  Peter Thomas narrates the series which is still in production, with more than 400 episodes. In 2002, ''Forensic Files'' would appear on [[NBC]] as the first prime time television series originally produced for cable to air on a commercial network, as a summer replacement series.

'''Meister Cody''' is an [[Online game|online training game]] with an integrated diagnostic screening test for children with [[dyscalculia]] and math weakness, the [[CODY Assessment]]. It was developed as a part of the CODY Project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY Project. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt; a collaboration with psychologists and neuroscientists at the [[University of Münster]], and technology experts at ''Kaasa health'' (an [[mHealth]] tech company based in [[Düsseldorf]]). The [[educational video game]] is used by parents, teachers and therapists as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. The scientific research at the [[University of Münster]] drove the development of the computer-based training software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/CODY/training.html ''CODY-Training'' Website of the University of Münster. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Before the training begins, children take the [[CODY Assessment]], a voluntary screening test that detects four dyscalculia relevant aspects: core markers (Dot Enumeration (DE), Magnitude Comparison (MCS, MCM)), number processing skills, calculation skills, and working memory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/test-and-training/ ''Meister Cody Test'' Link to test and training page. Retrieved 2016-05-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T./ Holling, H.: ''Number sense or working memory? The effect of two computer-based trainings on mathematical skills in elementary school.''  In: Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 2014, vol. 10(2), pp. 59-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, J.-T.: ''Developmental Dyscalculia. Causes, Characteristics, and Interventions.'' In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, pp 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The CODY training targets impaired number skills that could underlie dyscalculia. The focus lies on aspects of number and quantity processing, such as quantity-number-linkage, part-whole relationship, spatial ability, relational number perception, fact retrieval, [[subitizing]], understanding of the positional notation system and [[transcoding]].&lt;ref&gt;Landerl, K./ Kaufmann, L.: ''Dyskalkulie.

The first version of CODY training, which had four key tasks, was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, and compared with a computer-based training of inductive reasoning. A meta-analysis by psychologists at the University of Münster about children with mathematical disorders showed: "Computer-based interventions were also effective".&lt;ref&gt;Chodura, S., Kuhn, J.-T., Holling, H.: ''Interventions for Children With Mathematical Difficulties: A Meta-Analysis.

In: Zeitschrift für Psychologie, 2015, vol. 223, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The math training is embedded in an adventure story and incorporates gamification via its reward system. Daily training (3–5 days per week) is recommended for maximum growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meistercody.com/en/page/science/ ''CODY Assessment'' Link to scientific based background of the CODY project.

== Characters ==
The main character of the educational game is Meister Cody, a traveler, storyteller, scholar and master magician. He receives a call for help through his crystal ball from the Kingdom of Talasia. He asks the game player to assist Princess Namea and Prince Fandales to save Talasia. The epic story has many characters, such as the Genie, Port Master, Oracle, Forest Fairies and Ice Fairies. These characters give the child clues, support and motivation.

== Application ==
The game is aimed at elementary school children from the second to fourth grade, but it also develops basic math skills that could benefit children in kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, C./ Petermann, F.:''Rechenstörungen'', 2007, pp. 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Meister Cody – Talasia is an adaptive [[Single player video game|single player game]].

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be "crippling" psychologically.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful  pregnancies and children.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  A woman can grieve the "loss of a future child" and question her own role as a mother.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/grief-after-miscarriage#1|title=Grief After Miscarriage|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2011dil/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

"Women today...are aught in a unique historical moment: technology encourages them to form emotional attachments to their pregnancies, but society has not developed traditions to cushion the shock when those attachmets are shattered."{{sfn | Seftel | page = 62}}

Descriptions of the miscarriage are expressed in non-clinical terms by those who have experienced the event.

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}
&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford|first=Eleanor J|last2=Hughes|first2=Mark|date=2015-06-01|title=Women's experiences of early miscarriage: implications for nursing care|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=11–12|pages=1457–1465|doi=10.1111/jocn.12781|pmid=25662397|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; The religious faith of the woman and family impacts the grief process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowchock|first=F.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==
Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture.&lt;ref name="Klass2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klass|first1=Dennis|title=Book Reviews of Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=70|issue=4|year=2015|pages=454–457|issn=0030-2228|doi=10.1177/0030222815573931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicefoundation.org/Grief-(1)/What-to-Expect | title=Hospice Foundation of America - What is Grief?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s [[culture]] plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shear|first1=MK|last2=Simon|first2=N|last3=Wall|first3=M|last4=Zisook|first4=S|last5=Neimeyer|first5=R|last6=Duan|first6=N|last7=Reynolds|first7=C|last8=Lebowitz|first8=B|last9=Sung|first9=S|last10=Ghesquiere|first10=A|last11=Gorscak|first11=B|last12=Clayton|first12=P|last13=Ito|first13=M|last14=Nakajima|first14=S|last15=Konishi|first15=T|last16=Melhem|first16=N|last17=Meert|first17=K|last18=Schiff|first18=M|last19=O'Connor|first19=MF|last20=First|first20=M|last21=Sareen|first21=J|last22=Bolton|first22=J|last23=Skritskaya|first23=N|last24=Mancini|first24=AD|last25=Keshaviah|first25=A|title=Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5.|journal=Depression and Anxiety|date=February 2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–17|doi=10.1002/da.20780|pmid=21284063|pmc=3075805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed.

Investigations describe their grief over their miscarriage: "When miscarriage occurs it is not a gore, an embryo, or a fetus they lose, it is their child.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">The '''National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard''' ('''NIMAS''') helps facilitate timely access to alternate formats of [[instructional materials]] for students with [[visual impairments]] or other [[print disabilities]]. NIMAS (pronounced NYE-mas) outlines a set of consistent and valid [[XML]]-based source files created by [[K-12]] [[curriculum]] [[publishers]] or other content producers. These well-structured source files can be used to create [[accessible]] specialized formats (i.e., [[braille]], audio, [[e-text]], [[large print]], etc.) of print instructional materials. The full set of files includes XML content files, a package file, [[image]]s, and a [[PDF]] file of the title page (or whichever page contains [[ISBN]] and [[copyright]] information).

In a significant step forward for students with disabilities, the [[U.S. Congress]] adopted NIMAS as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, a reauthorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2674">In [[spherical astronomy]], the '''parallactic angle''' is the angle between the [[great circle]] through a [[celestial object]] and the [[zenith]], and the [[hour circle]] of the object.&lt;ref name="aips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astron.nl/aips++/docs/glossary/p.html#parallactic_angle|title=AIPS++ Glossary|publisher=Associated Universities Inc., Washington, D.C.|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually denoted ''q''. In the triangle zenith—object—celestial pole, the parallactic angle will be the [[position angle]] of the zenith at the celestial object. Despite its name, this angle is unrelated with [[parallax]]. The parallactic angle is zero when the object crosses the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].

== Uses ==
Depending on the type of [[telescope mount|mount]] of the [[telescope]], this angle may also affect the orientation of the celestial object's disk as seen in a telescope. With an [[equatorial mount]], the cardinal points of the celestial object's disk are aligned with the vertical and horizontal direction of the view in the telescope. With an [[altazimuth mount]], those directions are rotated by the amount of the parallactic angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petermeadows.com/html/parallactic.html|title=Solar Observing: Parallactic Angle|last=Meadows|first=Peter|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal points referred to here are the points on the limb located such that a line from the center of the disk through them will point to one of the celestial poles or 90° away from them; these are not the [[cardinal points]] defined by the object's axis of rotation.

The orientation of the disk of the Moon, as related to the [[horizon]], changes throughout its [[diurnal motion]] and the parallactic angle changes equivalently.&lt;ref name="meeus1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meeus|first=Jean|title=Astronomical Algorithms|date=1998|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case with other celestial objects.

In an [[ephemeris]], the [[position angle]] of the midpoint of the bright [[lunar limb|limb]] of the Moon or planets, and the position angles of their [[North pole]]s may be tabulated. If this angle is measured from the North point on the limb, it can be converted to an angle measured from the zenith point (the vertex) as seen by an observer by subtracting the parallactic angle.&lt;ref name="meeus1998" /&gt; The position angle of the bright limb is directly related to that of the [[subsolar point]].

A '''Persian carpet''' ({{lang-fa|فرش ايرانى}} ''farsh'', meaning "to spread") or '''Persian rug''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: قالی ايرانى ''qālī-ye īranī''),&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Iranian carpet''', is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in [[Iran]] (historically known as [[Name of Iran|Persia]]), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an essential part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Iranian art]]. Within the group of [[Oriental rug]]s produced by the countries of the so-called '''"rug belt"''', the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.

Persian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the [[history of Iran]] and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] court manufactories of [[Isfahan]] during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]], [[Mashhad]], [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Nain rug|Nain]] and [[Qom rug|Qom]] are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of [[Tabriz]] have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. [[Gabbeh]] rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.

The art and craft of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of political unrest, or under the influence of commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with [[natural dye]]s, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.

Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like [[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], and embroidered tissues like [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in [[Fars Province]] and [[Kashan rug|Kashan]] were inscribed to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00382|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00383|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of '''[[felt]]''', or a technique known as "'''flat weaving'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[warp and weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as '''loop weaving'''. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine [[pile rug]]. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the [[pile (textile)|thread]] after each single knot.

=== The Pazyryk carpet: Earliest pile-woven carpet ===
[[File:Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]]. Circa 400 BC. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

The [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] carpet was excavated in 1949 from the grave of a [[Scythia]]n nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="Haider, R."&gt;Haider, R., ''Carpet that Captive''&lt;/ref&gt; This carpet is {{convert|183|x|200|cm|abbr=off}} and has 36 symmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] cm² (232 per inch²).&lt;ref&gt;Nouri-Zadeh, Sh., ''Turkish Carpet; The Beautiful Picture of Art in History'',&lt;/ref&gt; The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinson, Karen S., ''"Animal Style" Art &amp; the Image of the Horse and Rider''&lt;/ref&gt; Its central field is a deep red color and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 x 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=2,500-Year-Old Carpet is Stunning Reflection of Advanced Culture of the Pazyryk Nomads|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/2500-year-old-carpet-stunning-reflection-advanced-culture-pazyryk-nomads-021858|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet, [[Sergei Rudenko]], assumed it to be a product of the contemporary [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]].&lt;ref&gt;S.I. Rudenko, ''Kul'tura naseleniia Gornogo Altaia v skifskoe vremia'' (Moscow and Leningrad, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudenko, Sergei I., Frozen Tombs of Siberia, The Pazyryk Burials of Iron-Age Horseman (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it was produced in the region where it was found, or is a product of Achaemenid manufacture, remains subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner J., ''Some So-called Achaemenid Objects from Pazyryk'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:8-15 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harald Böhmer and Jon Thompson, ''The Pazyryk Carpet: A Technical Discussion'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:30-36 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Its fine weaving and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production.

=== Early fragments ===
There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]], assumed to have lived around 850 BC, writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a "splendid carpet". In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X "carpets" are mentioned. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets ("polymita") were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the Greek and Latin texts.

Flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD were found in [[Turfan]], [[Hotan|Hotan prefecture]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;ref name="Spuhler Carpets Islamic Museum Berlin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Die Orientteppiche im Museum für Islamische Kunst Berlin|date=1987|publisher=Klinkhardt and Biermann|location=Munich|isbn=3-7814-0270-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fragments woven in symmetrical as well as asymmetrical knots have been found in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfister|first1=R.|last2=Bellinger|first2=L.|title=The Excavations at Dura-Europos; IV Vol. 2 The Textiles|date=1945|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the At-Tar caves in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name="At-Tar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fujii|first1=Hideo|last2=Sakamoto|first2=Kazuko|editor1-last=Eiland|editor1-first=M.L.|title=The marked characteristics of carpets unearthed from the At-Tar caves, Iraq|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV|pages=35–40|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the first centuries AD.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

=== Early history: circa 500 BC – 200 AD ===
Persian carpets were first mentioned around 400 BC, by the Greek author [[Xenophon]] in his book "[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς", (Xen. anab. VII.3.18)
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ|Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Xenophon describes Persian (lit.: "barbarian", meaning: non-Greek) carpets as precious, and worthy to be used as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., [[kilim|flat-weaving]], or [[embroidery]], but it is interesting that the very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.

There are no surviving Persian carpets from the reigns of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenian]] (553–330 BC), [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] (312–129 BC), and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (ca. 170 BC – 226 AD) kings.

=== The Sasanian Empire: 224–651 ===

The [[Sasanian Empire]], which succeeded the [[Parthian Empire]], was recognized as one of the leading powers of its time, alongside its neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire]], for a period of more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;International Congress of Byzantine Studies ''Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies, London, 21–26 August 2006, Volumes 1–3'' pp 29. Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 {{ISBN|075465740X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sasanids established their empire roughly within the borders set by the Achaemenids, with the capital at [[Ctesiphon]]. This last Persian dynasty before the arrival of [[Islam]] adopted [[Zoroastrianism]] as the state religion.

When and how exactly the Persians started weaving pile carpets is currently unknown, but the knowledge of carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: [[History of Anatolia|Anatolia]], located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare as well as by trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat weaving and embroidery were known during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, where they were used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=N. (no author)|first1=N.|title=Splendeur des Sassanides: L'empire Perse entre Rome et la Chine (224-642) / the Splendor of the Sassanians: the Persian Empire between Rome and China (224-642)|date=1993|publisher=Credit Communal|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Chinese cultural revolution]], or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the [[Silk Road]] near [[Turpan|Turfan]]. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by the report of the historian [[Al-Tabari]] about the [[Baharestan Carpet|Spring of Khosrow]] carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche = Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictions of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|pages=14–19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments are now in the [[House of Sabah|Al-Sabah]] Collection in the [[Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah]], [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="darmuseum.org.kw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah rugs and textiles collection|url=http://darmuseum.org.kw/the-collections/rugs-textiles/|website=Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet fragments, although reliably dated to the early Sasanian time, do not seem to be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating [[Shag (fabric)|shag]] on the reverse hints at the need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.&lt;ref name="Spuhler, Pre-Islamic carpets 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Pre-Islamic carpets and textiles from eastern lands.|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=Farnborough|isbn=9780500970546|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The advent of Islam and the Caliphates: 651–1258 ===
The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Persia became a part of the Islamic world, ruled by Muslim [[Caliphate]]s.

Arabian geographers and historians visiting Persia provide, for the first time, references to the use of carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the [[Hudud al-'Alam]] states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] refers to carpets in the Qaināt. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] tells us that carpets were woven in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijān]] in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari [[atabeg]] in [[Izeh|Idhej]]. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian carpet : a survey of the carpet-weaving industry of Persia|date=1975|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715602560|edition=Reprinted 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Caliphs over Persia ended when the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was overthrown in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] by the [[Mongol Empire]] under [[Hulagu Khan]]. The Abbasid line of rulers recentered themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious matters until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt]] (1517). Under the Mamluk dynasty in Cairo, large carpets known as "Mamluk carpets" were produced.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Mamluks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

=== Seljuq invasion and Turko-Persian tradition: 1040–1118 ===
{{see also|Turkish carpet}}

Beginning at latest with the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq]] invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a distinct [[Turko-Persian tradition]] emerged. Fragments of woven carpets were found in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in the Turkish town of [[Konya]] and the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]], and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"/&gt;

=== The Mongol Ilkhanate (1256–1335) and Timurid Empire (1370–1507) ===
[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|A Mongol prince studying the Koran. Illustration of Rashid-ad-Din's Gami' at-tawarih. Tabriz (?), 1st quarter of 14th century]]
Between 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. After 1260, the title [[Ilkhanate|"Ilkhan"]] was borne by the descendants of [[Hulagu Khan]] and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At the end of the thirteenth century, [[Ghazan]] Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the floors of his residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

With the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. In 1381, [[Timur]] invaded Iran and became the founder of the [[Timurid Empire]]. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until they had to submit to the [[Ag Qoyunlu|"White Sheep" Turkmen]] confederation under [[Uzun Hassan]] in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

In 1463, the Venetian Senate, seeking allies in the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479)]] established diplomatic relations with Uzun Hassans court at Tabriz. In 1473, [[Giosafat Barbaro]] was sent to Tabriz. In his reports to the Senate of Venetia he mentions more than once the splendid carpets which he saw at the palace. Some of them, he wrote, were of silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Lettere%20al%20senato%20veneto%20annotate%20per%20E.%20Cornet%20giosafat%20barbaro|title=Worldcat|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1403-05 [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] was the ambassador of [[Henry III of Castile]] to the court of [[Timur]], founder and ruler of the [[Timurid Empire]]. He described that in Timur's palace at [[Samarkand]], "everywhere the floor was covered with carpets and reed mattings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Clavijo|first1=Ruy Gonzáles|editor1-last=Le Strange|editor1-first=Guy|title=Embassy to Tamerlane, 1403-1406|date=2009|publisher=Hardinge Simpole|location=Kilkerran|isbn=978-1843821984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timurid period miniatures show carpets with geometrical designs, rows of octagons and stars, knot forms, and borders sometimes derived from [[kufic]] script. None of the carpets woven before 1500 AD have survived.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Safavid Period (1501–1732) ===

In 1499, a new dynasty arose in Persia. Shah [[Ismail I]], its founder, was related to Uzun Hassan. He is regarded as the first national sovereign of Persia since the Arab conquest, and established [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]] as the state religion of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521042512|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his successors, Shah [[Tahmasp I]] and Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] became patrons of the Persian [[Safavid art]]. Court manufactories were probably established by Shah Tahmasp in Tabriz, but definitely by Shah Abbas when he moved his capital from Tabriz in northwestern to [[Isfahan]] in central Persia, in the wake of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)]]. For the art of carpet weaving in Persia, this meant, as Edwards wrote: "that in a short time it rose from a cottage ''métier'' to the dignity of a fine art."&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The time of the [[Safavid dynasty]] marks one of the greatest periods in [[Iranian art|Persian art]], which includes carpet weaving. Later Safavid period carpets still exist, which belong to the finest and most elaborate weavings known today. The phenomenon that the first carpets physically known to us show such accomplished designs leads to the assumption that the art and craft of carpet weaving must already have existed for some time before the magnificent Safavid court carpets could have been woven. As no early Safavid period carpets survived, research has focused on Timurid period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. These paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with "kufic" border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially to "[[Holbein carpet]]s" that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The "design revolution" ====
By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier "kufic" border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''"carpet design revolution"'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=30–32|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently, the new designs were developed first by miniature painters, as they started to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This marks the first time when the "classical" design of Islamic rugs was established: The medaillon and corner design (pers.: "Lechek Torūnj") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail I employed the miniature painter [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|editor1-last=Erdmann|editor1-first=Hanna|editor2-last=Beattie (transl.)|editor2-first=May H.|title=Seven hundred years of Oriental carpets.|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some carpets like the [[Ardabil carpet]]s have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no refuge in the world other than thy threshold.&lt;br/&gt;There is no protection for my head other than this door.''&lt;br/&gt;''The work of the slave of the threshold Maqsud of Kashan in the year 946.&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Ardabil carpet''}}

The AH year of 946 corresponds to AD 1539-40, which dates the Ardabil carpet to the reign of Shah Tahmasp, who donated the carpet to the shrine of Shaykh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] in [[Ardabil]], who is regarded as the spiritual father of the Safavid dynasty.

Another inscription can be seen on the "Hunting Carpet", now at the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli]], Milan, which dates the carpet to 949 AH/AD 1542–3:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;By the diligence of Ghyath ud-Din Jami was completed&lt;br/&gt;This renowned work, that appeals to us by its beauty&lt;br/&gt;In the year 949&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Milan Hunting carpet''}}

[[File:Embassy to Europe.jpg|thumb|Shah 'Abbas I. embassy to Venice, by [[Carlo Caliari]], 1595. Doge's palace, Venice]]

The number of sources for more precise dating and the attribution of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge [[Marino Grimani (doge)|Marino Grimani]]. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the [[Armenia]]n Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt; Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of "Polish" or "Polonaise" carpets. The more appropriate type name of "Shah Abbas" carpets was suggested by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt;

==== Safavid "Vase technique" carpets from Kirmān ====
[[File:Sanguszko carpet 01.jpg|thumb|"Sanguszko carpet", Kirmān, 16/17th century. [[Miho Museum]]]]
[[File:Safavid tilework MKG Hamburg.jpg|thumb|Tiled arch with hunting scenes. Late 17th century, Isfahan/Iran. [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]], Hamburg]]

A distinct group of Safavid carpets can be attributed to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure:&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia : with special references to rugs of Kirman.|date=1976|publisher=World of Islam Festival Pub. Co.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0905035178|pages=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the front. When the carpets are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, "tram line" effect.

The best known "vase technique" carpets from Kirmān are those of the so-called "Sanguszko group", named after the [[House of Sanguszko]], whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with [[Houri]]s, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to mosaic tile spandrels in the [[Ganjali Khan Complex]] at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrier|first1=R.W.|title=The arts of Persia|date=1989|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300039875|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other "vase technique" carpets have inscriptions with a date: One of them bears the date 1172 AH/AD 1758 and the name of the weaver: the Master Craftsman Muhammad Sharīf Kirmānī, the other has three inscriptions indicating that it was woven by the Master Craftsman Mu'min, son of Qutb al-Dīn Māhānī, between 1066-7 AH/AD 1655-6. Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;127&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"/&gt;).

The end of [[Shah Abbas II]]'s reign in 1666 marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] chieftain named [[Mirwais Khan Hotak|Mir Wais Khan]] began a rebellion in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, [[Gurgin Khan]]. In 1722, [[Peter the Great]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including [[Derbent]], [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Baku]], but also [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Astrabad]]. In 1722, an Afghan army led by [[Mir Mahmud Hotaki]] marched across eastern Iran, and [[Siege of Isfahan|besieged and took Isfahan]]. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axworthy|first1=Michael|title=The sword of Persia : Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant|date=2008|publisher=I.

=== The Afsharid (1736–1796) and Zand (1750–1796) dynasties ===
[[File:North West Persian Runner detail.jpg|thumb|North West Persian Runner (detail), late 18th century|upright]]
Iran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Afsharid|Afshar]] warlord from Khorasan, [[Nader Shah]]. He defeated the Afghans, and [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|Ottomans]], [[Restoration of Tahmasp II to the Safavid throne|reinstalled]] the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the [[Treaty of Resht]] and [[Treaty of Ganja]]. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of carpet weaving, which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Qajãr dynasty (1789–1925) ===
In 1789, [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]] was crowned king of Persia, the founder of the [[Qajar dynasty]], which provided Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]], [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], and [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]] revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of carpet weaving in Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) ===
In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]], Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|unsuccessful attempt]] to reverse the Revolution. The [[Soviet Union]] responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the [[Persian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By 1920, the Iranian government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland.

In 1925 Rezā Shāh, supported by the British government, deposed [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]], and founded the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state. In order to stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of carpet weaving, often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought carpet weaving under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillmann|first1=Michael Craig|title=A cultural-aesthetic analysis of a modern Persian carpet|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pahlavi dynasty modernized and centralized the Iranian government, and sought effective control and authority over all their subjects. Reza Shah was the first Persian monarch to confront this challenge with modern weapons. Enforced by the army, nomadism was outlawed during the 1930s, traditional tribal dresses were banned, the use of tents and yurts was forbidden in Iran. Unable to migrate, having lost their herds, many nomadic families starved to death. A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia was involved in the Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called [[White Revolution]], despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the [[Qashqai people]], and the traditional way of nomadic life. The centuries-old traditions of nomadic carpet weaving, which had entered a process of decline with the introduction of synthetic dyes and commercial designs in the late nineteenth century, were almost annihilated by the politics of the last Iranian imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"/&gt;

=== Modern times ===
[[File:Tabriz Lilac.jpg|thumb|Modern Iranian Carpet "Tabriz Lilac", 2010, by Hossein Rezvani]]
[[File:TapisGabbeh.png|thumb|A modern gabbeh carpet]]

After the [[Iranian Revolution]], little information could at first be obtained about carpet weaving in Iran. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new interest arose in Europe in [[Gabbeh]] rugs, which were initially woven by nomadic tribes for their own use. Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.

In 1992, the first Grand Persian Conference and Exhibition in Tehran presented for the first time modern Persian carpet designs. Persian master weavers like Razam Arabzadeh displayed carpets woven in the traditional technique, but with unusual, modern designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. III|title=Persian design: A step forward|journal=The Decorative Rug|date=1994|volume=7|issue=9|pages=40–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Grand Conferences continue to take place at regular intervals, two trends can be observed in Iranian carpet weaving today. On the one hand, modern and innovative artistic designs are invented and developed by Iranian manufacturers, who thus take the ancient design tradition forward towards the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the renewed interest in natural dyes&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by commercial enterprises, which commission carpets to tribal village weavers. This provides a regular source of income for the carpet weavers. The companies usually provide the material and specify the designs, but the weavers are allowed some degree of creative freedom. With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique Persian carpets acquired at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

As commercial household goods, Persian carpets today are encountering competition from other countries with lower wages and cheaper methods of production: Machine-woven, [[Tufting|tufted]] rugs, or rugs woven by hand, but with the faster and less costly loop weaving method, provide rugs in "oriental" designs of utilitarian, but no artistic value. Traditional hand woven carpets, made of sheep wool dyed with natural colours are increasingly sought after. They are usually sold at higher prices due to the large amount of manual work associated with their production, which has, essentially, not changed since ancient times, and due to the artistic value of their design. Thus, the Persian carpet retains its ancient status as an object of luxury, beauty, and art.

== Materials ==

=== Wool ===
In most Persian rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is "skin" wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; Higher grades of Persian wool are often referred to as '''kurk''', or '''kork''' wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. [[Merino]] wool from [[New Zealand]], because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like [[Baloch people|Baluch]] rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== Cotton ===
[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Silk ===
[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as [[Tapestries|wall hangings]], or pillows.

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}
[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|upright|50px|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. Like nearly all Islamic rugs with the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all Persian rugs use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===
[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Plants ====
[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used in Persian rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyses, natural dyes used for carpet wool include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur, or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

In Iran, traditional dyeing with natural dyes was revived in the 1990s, inspired by the renewed general interest in traditionally produced rugs, but master dyers like Abbas Sayahi had kept alive the knowledge about the traditional recipes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Insect reds ====
[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====
With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that without chemical analysis it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====
The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and structures==
{{see also|Oriental rug # manufacture}}

=== The process of weaving a rug ===
The weaving of pile rugs is a time-consuming process which, depending on the quality and size of the rug, may take anywhere from a few months to several years to complete.

To begin making a rug, one needs a foundation consisting of warps and wefts: [[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which run through the length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one side to the other are called [[Warp and woof|wefts]]. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.

Weaving normally begins from the bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the [[knot count]] of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.

When the rug is completed, the warp ends form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.

===Looms===
Looms do not vary greatly in essential details, but they do vary in size and sophistication. The main technical requirement of the loom is to provide the correct tension and the means of dividing the warps into alternate sets of leaves. A shedding device allows the weaver to pass wefts through crossed and uncrossed warps, instead of laboriously threading the weft in and out of the warps.

===Horizontal looms===
The simplest form of loom is a horizontal; one that can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

===Vertical looms===
The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled around the back of the loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.

===Tools===
[[File:Carpet tools.jpg|thumb|Some traditional tools of the craft.]]

The weaver needs a number of essential tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; and a pair of shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.

A variety of additional instruments are used for packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In [[Kerman]], a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.

A number of different tools may be used to shear the wool depending on how the rug is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when the rug is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.

===Knots===

}}

Persian carpets are mainly woven with two different knots: The symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]] or "Giordes" knot, also used in Turkey, the Caucasus, East Turkmenistan, and some Turkish and Kurdish areas of Iran, and the asymmetrical '''Persian''', or '''Senneh knot''', also used in India, Turkey, Pakistan, China, and Egypt. The term "Senneh knot" is somewhat misleading, as rugs are woven with symmetric knots in the town of Senneh.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

To tie a symmetric knot, the yarn is passed between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled through the center so that both ends emerge between the warps.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot is tied by wrapping the yarn around only one warp, then the thread is passed behind the adjacent warp so that it divides the two ends of the yarn. The Persian knot may open on the left or the right.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot allows to produce more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, the quality of the design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

Another knot frequently used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Flat-woven carpets===
Flat woven carpets are given their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly intertwined with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.

The most popular of flat-weaves is called the Kilim. Kilim rugs (along with jewellery, clothing and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribes-people. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.

Various forms of flat-weaves exist including:
*[[Herati rug|Herati]]
*[[Jajim rug|Jajim]]
*[[Gelim]] ([[Kilim]])
*[[Maleki rug|Maleki]]
*[[Sirjan rug|Sirjan]]
*[[Soumak rug|Soumak]] (Soumakh)
*[[Suzani rug|Suzani]]

==Design==
[[File:Persian Kermanshah 'Tree of Life' (4-6 x 7-8, ca 3rd quarter 19th century).jpg|thumb|[[Kermanshah]] 'Tree of Life' carpet, 3rd quarter 19th century]]
In 2016 Iran had 40 carpet designs that each belong to a different [[Provinces of Iran|geographical region]] including 29 designs internationally registered with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;http://presstv.com/Detail/2016/11/06/492379/Iran-to-ship-carpets-to-US-directly-soon&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formats and special types ===
* '''''Ghali''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالی}}, lit. "carpet"): large format carpets (190 × 280&amp;nbsp;cm).
* '''''Dozar''''' or '''''Sedjadeh''''': The term comes from Persian ''do'', "two" and ''zar'', a Persian measure corresponding to about {{convert|105|cm|lk=out|abbr=off}}. Carpets of Dozar size are approximately {{convert|130|-|140|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|200|-|210|cm|abbr=on}}.
* '''''Ghalitcheh''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالیچه}}): Carpet of Dozar format, but woven in very fine quality.
* '''''Kelleghi''''' or '''''Kelley''''' : A long format, ca. {{convert|150|-|200|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|300|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. This format is traditionally placed at the head of a ''ghali'' carpet (''kalleh'' means "head" in Persian).
* '''''Kenareh''''' : Smaller long format: {{convert|80|-|120|cm|abbr=on}} × {{convert|250|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. Traditionally laid out along the longer sides of a larger carpet (''kenār'' means "side" in Persian language).
* '''''Zaronim''''' : corresponds to 1 ½ ''zar''. These smaller rugs are about {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}} long.

[[Nomad]]ic carpets are also known as '''''Gelim''''' ({{lang|fa|گلیم}}; including {{lang|fa|زیلو}} ''Zilu'', meaning "rough carpet".&lt;ref name="Savory, R."/&gt; In this use, Gelim includes both pile rugs and flat weaves (such as [[kilim]] and [[soumak rug|soumak]]).

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|Toranj (medallion) - special circular design of Iranian carpets]]
Rug design can be described by the way the ornaments are arranged within the pile. One basic design may dominate the entire field, or the surface may be covered by a pattern of repeating figures.

In areas with traditional, time-honoured local designs, such as the Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the specific patterns are part of the family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a "cartoon". The weaver weaves a knot for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Rugs: A Complete Guide, by Murray L. Eiland Jr. &amp; Murray Eiland III, London 2008, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the rug is arranged and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field ('''"all-over design"'''). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called '''infinite repeat'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four '''corners''' of the field. The common Persian "Lechek Torūnj" (medaillon and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In contrast to Anatolian rugs, the Persian carpet medaillon represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinate, creating an impression of the medaillon "floating" on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Persian rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider '''main border''' surrounded by minor, or '''guardian borders'''. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs.

The corner articulations are a particularly challenging part of rug design. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be "resolved", or "reconciled". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===
The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the [[Paisley (design)|'''boteh''']] is used throughout the "carpet belt". Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called "fish".  Herati patterns are used throughout the "carpet belt"; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Safavid period, and the "claws" of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.

== Classification ==
Persian carpets are best classified by the social context of their weavers. Carpets were produced simultaneously by nomadic tribes, in villages, town and court manufactures, for home use, local sale, or export.
{{clear}}

=== Nomadic/tribal carpets ===
Nomadic, or tribal carpets are produced by different ethnic groups with distinct histories and traditions. As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced settlement policy of the last Persian emperors of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. By 1970, it was observed that traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes,&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Kurds ====
The [[Kurds]] are an [[ethnic group]], mostly inhabiting the area spanning adjacent parts of southeastern ([[Turkish Kurdistan|Turkey]]), western ([[Iranian Kurdistan|Iran]]), northern ([[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraq]]), and northern ([[Rojava|Syria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bengio|first1=Ofra|title=Kurdish awakening: Nation building in a fragmented homeland|date=2014|publisher=Univ of Texas Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0292758131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large population and the wide geographical distribution of the Kurds account for a varied production spanning a spectre from coarse and naïve nomadic weavings to the most elaborate town manufacture carpets, finely woven like Senneh, or heavy fabrics like [[Bidjar rug|Bijar]] carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagleton|first1=William|title=An introduction to Kurdish rugs and other weavings|date=1988|publisher=Interlink Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0940793170|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kurdish rugs represent a traditional part of Persian rug production, they merit separate consideration.

===== Senneh carpets =====
[[File:Senneh.jpg|thumb|1Senneh rug]]

The city of [[Sanandij]], formerly known as Senneh, is the capital of [[Kurdistan Province|Persian Kurdistan]]. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name "Senneh". They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine carpets have silk warps dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as "rainbow warps" in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours are used in the field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Herati pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Herati patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Bijar carpets =====
[[File:Fine Bidjar rug.jpg|thumb|Bidjar rug]]

The town of [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]] lies around {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} northeast of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding areas have been major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, which has led to the distinction between "city" and "village" Bijar rugs. The Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as "wet weaving", with the help of a special tool. Warps, weft and pile are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is consideravly thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), rarely even over 400 (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The colours of Bijar rugs are exquisite, with light and dark blues, and saturated to light, pale madder red. The designs are traditionally Persian, with predominant Herati, but also Mina Khani, Harshang, and simple medallion forms. Frequently the design is more rectilinear, but Bijar rugs are more easily identified by their peculiar, stiff and heavy weaving than by any design. Bijar rugs cannot be folded without risking to damage the foundation. A specific feature is also the lack of outlining, particularly of the smaller patterns. Full-size "sampler" carpets showing only examples of field and border designs rather than a fully developed carpet design are called "vagireh" by rug traders, and are frequently seen in the Bijar area. New Bijar carpets are still exported from the area, mostly with less elaborate Herati designs and dyed with good synthetic dyes.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Kurdish village rugs =====
From a Western perspective, there is not much detailed information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as "northwest Persian, probably Kurdish".&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of "village production", made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal provenience. A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used "Kurdish" design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Qashqai ====

[[File:Abrash.JPG|thumb|Central medallion of a Qashqai rug, 19th century, with fragmented Herati pattern]]
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}

The early history of the [[Qashqai people]] remains obscure. They speak a Turkic dialect similar to that of Azerbaijan, and may have migrated to the Fars province from the north during the thirteenth century, possibly driven by the Mongol invasion. [[Karim Khan]] Zand appointed the chief of the Chahilu clan as the first Il-Khan of the Qashqai.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; The most important subtribes are the Qashguli, Shishbuluki, Darashuri, Farsimadan, and Amaleh. The Gallanzan, Rahimi, and Ikdir produce rugs of intermediate quality. The rugs woven by the Safi Khani and Bulli subtribes are considered among the highest quality rugs.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; The rugs are all wool, usually with ivory warps, which distinguishes Qashqai from Khamseh rugs. Qashqai rugs use asymmetric knots, while Gabbeh rugs woven by Qashqai more often use symmetric knots. Alternate warps are deeply depressed. Wefts are in natural colours or dyed red. The selvedges are overcast in wool of different colours, creating a "barber pole" pattern, and are sometimes adorned with woolen tassels. Both ends of the rug have narrow, striped flat-woven kilims. Workshops were established in the nineteenth century already around the town of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]. Rugs with repeating boteh and the Herati pattern, medallion, as well as prayer rug designs resembling the millefleurs patterns of Indian rugs were woven in these manufactures. The Herati design may sometimes appear to be disjointed and fragmented. The Qashqai are also known for their flatweaves, and for their production of smaller, pile-woven saddle bags, flat-woven larger bags (''mafrash''), and their [[Gabbeh]] rugs.

The '''Shishbuluki''' (''lit.'': "six districts") rugs are distinguished by small, central, lozenge-shaped medallions surrounded by small figures aligned in concentric lozenges radiating from the center. The field is most often red, details are often woven in yellow or ivory. '''Darashuri''' rugs are similar to those of the Shishbuluki, but not so finely woven.&lt;ref name="Parham 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Cyrus|title=Masterpieces of Fars Rugs|date=1996|publisher=Soroush Press|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the truly nomadic way of life has virtually come to an end during the twentieth century, most Qashqai rugs are now woven in villages, using vertical looms, cotton warps, or even an all-cotton foundation. They use a variety of designs associated with the Qashqai tradition, but it is rarely possible to attribute a specific rug to a specific tribal tradition. Many patterns, including the "Qashqai medallion" previously thought to represent genuine nomadic design traditions, have been shown to be of town manufacture origin, and were integrated into the rural village traditions by a process of stylization.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

The revival of natural dyeing has had a major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in [[Shiraz]] during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi,&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt; particularly [[Gabbeh]] rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from [[Fars province]] soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Khamseh federation ====
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}
[[File:persian rug.jpg|thumb|A rug by [[Basseri|Basseri tribe]]]]

The [[Khamseh]] (''lit.'': "five tribes") federation was established by the Persian [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] government in the nineteenth century, to rival the dominant Qashqai power. Five tribal groups of Arab, Persian and Turkic origin were combined, including the Arab tribe, the [[Basseri]], Baharlu, Ainalu, and Nafar tribes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; It is difficult to attribute a specific rug to the Khamseh production, and the label "Khamseh" is often used as a term of convenience. Dark woolen warps and borders are associated with '''Arab''' Khamseh rugs, warps are rarely depressed, the colour scheme is more subdued. Specifically, a stylized bird (''"murgh"'') pattern is often seen on rugs attributed to the confederation, arranged around a succession of small, lozenge shaped medallions. '''[[Basseri]]''' rugs are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; The '''Baharlu''' are a Turkic-speaking tribe settled around [[Darab]], and few carpets are known from this more agricultural region.

==== Luri ====
The [[Lurs]] live mainly in western and south-western Iran. They are of Indo-European origin. Their [[Luri language|dialect]] is closely related to the [[Bakhtiari dialect]] and to the dialect of the southern [[Kurds]]. Their rugs have been marketed in [[Shiraz]]. The rugs have a dark wool foundation, with two wefts after each row of knots. Knots are symmetrical or asymmetrical. Small compartment designs of repeating stars are often seen, or lozenge-shaped medallions with anchor-like hooks on both ends.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt;

==== Afshari ====
{{see also|Afshar rugs}}

The [[Afshar people]] are a semi-nomadic group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of [[Kirman]] in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and allover patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Beluch ====
{{see also|Baluch rug}}
The [[Beluch]] people live in eastern Iran. They weave small-format rugs and a variety of bags with dark red and blue colours, often combined with dark brown and white. Camel hair is also used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Village carpets ===
Carpets produced in villages are usually brought to a regional market center, and carry the name of the market center as a label. Sometimes, as in the case of the "Serapi" rug, the name of the village serves as a label for a special quality. Village carpets can be identified by their less elaborate, more highly stylized designs.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

Criteria suggesting village production include:&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilber|first1=Donald N.|title=An introduction to Persian village rugs|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A rug of so-called scatter-size (''dozar'') that has been woven in a settled environment;
# woven without a cartoon;
# woven without reconciled corners;
# woven with possible idiosyncrasies of construction and pattern elements.

Village rugs are more apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as elaborate and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"/&gt;

==== Northwestern Iran ====
{{main|Azerbaijani carpet|Ardabil rugs|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}
[[Tabriz]] is the market center for the Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the symmetric knot. [[Heriz]] is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of [[Sarab, East Azerbaijan|Sarab]] produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. [[Bakshaish rugs and carpets|Bakshaish carpets]] with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of [[Bakhshayesh]]. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Western Iran ====
Major production centers in the West are [[Hamadan]], [[Sarrak, Iran|Saruk]] with its neighbouring town of [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Minudasht, Markazi|Minudasht]] also known under the trade name [[Lilihan carpets and rugs|Lilihan]] and Serabend, Maslaghan, [[Malayer]] and Feraghan.

* Carpets from '''Maslaghan''' are usually small (120 × 180&amp;nbsp;cm), the warps are made of cotton, the wefts of wool or cotton. The large medaillon shows a so-called "lobed [[Gul (design)|Göl]]", the colours of which are in sharp contrast to the field, with small borders. Malayer, Sarouk and Feraghan are located closely to each other. They use cotton for the foundation.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* '''Malayer''' carpets sre distinguished by their single-weft and the use of the symmetrical knot. Allover and medaillon patterns are common, the boteh motif is frequently used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* The original '''Sarouk''' design was distinguished by a round-star medaillon with surrounding pendants. The traditional design of the Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; '''Feraghan''' carpets are less finely woven thsn Sarouk. Often the Herati pattern is seen all over. Medaillons, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Southern Iran ====
Since the mid-twentieth century, commercial production started in the villages of [[Abade]]h and Yalameh. [[Abadeh rug]]s adopted traditional [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. [[Yalameh rug|Yalameh]] carpets more resemble [[Khamseh]] designs with hooked medaillons arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Eastern Iran ====
The village of Doroksh is known for its carpet production in Eastern Persia. They are characterized by their use of orange dyes, the boteh motif is often seen. Usually, there is only one border. The knots are asymmetric.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Town carpets ===
[[File:Following the Pattern, Weaver, Esfahan, Iran (14451927066).jpg|thumb|Weaving a carpet from a cartoon, Esfahan, Iran]]

[[Tabriz]] in the West, [[Kerman]] in the South, and [[Mashhad]] in the Northeast of Iran, together with the central Iranian towns of [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]] and [[Qom]] are the main centers of town manufacture.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

* '''[[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]]''' has been a center of carpet production for centuries. All kinds of designs are reproduced by Tabrizi weavers, with wool or silk in the pile, and wool, cotton or silk in the foundation.
* '''[[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]''' is known for finely knotted, elegant carpets with prominent cochineal red, ivory and golden yellow colours. Their medaillons are elegantly designed, and elaborate versions of the boteh design are often seen in the field. 
* '''[[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]]''' carpets are of average quality. Cochineal red is often used. Emogli carpets are made of silk, and represent the finest carpets manufactured in Mashhad. They show dense arabesque patterns on red ground.
* '''[[Kashan rug|Kashan]]''' is the oldest carpet-producing city in Central Iran. Famous for its production of silk carpets, carpet weaving was revived in the late 19th century. The earliest carpets woven in Kashan at the turn of the nineteenth century show some imbalances in their designs, which was overcome, and carpets were produced mainly with a red or ivory field and elaborate ogival central medallions.
* '''[[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]]''', '''[[Nain rug|Nain]]''', and '''[[Qom rug|Qom]]''' revived or started carpet manufacture by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets are produced with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by [[Safavid art|Safavid]] designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated medaillons, and tender light blue and ivory colours. Isfahan carpets use more dark red and blue colours. They count among the finest Persian carpets today with some of them having a knot density of over one million knots per square meter. Some of the master weavers from these cities gained a worldwide reputation like Jamshidi from Qom or Habibian from Nain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carpet-wiki.com/persian-master-knotters|title=The most popular Persian master knotters|last=Trading|first=Nain|website=www.carpet-wiki.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial aspects ==
[[File:An Iranian Persian carpet exhibition.jpg|thumb|An Iranian/Persian carpet exhibition in city of [[Hamadan]] in 2015.]]
Iran exported $517 million worth of hand woven carpets in 2002. Iran's carpet exports amounted to US$635 million in 2004{{update after|2012|8}}, according to the figures from the state-owned Iran Carpet Company. In October 2006, National Iranian Carpet Center revealed that hand-woven carpets have ranked first in country's non-oil exports and hold the third position among overall exports. Nearly five million workers are engaged in the Iranian carpet industry, making it one of the biggest enterprises in the country.

In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing fakes of the original Persian designs as well as genuine cheaper substitutes. Most of the problems facing this traditional art is due to absence of patenting and branding the products as well as reduced quality of raw materials in the local market and the consistent loss of original design patterns. The absence of modern [[R&amp;D]] is causing rapid decline in the size as well as market value of this art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/business/story/2007/07/070701_ka-carpet-iranian.shtml BBCPersian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

United States is the single largest importer of Persian hand woven carpets. In 2011, President Obama signed into law an act that greatly enhanced restrictions on Iranian-origin imports, causing the imports of Iranian carpets to be frozen. In January 2016, the sanctions had been lifted and in the first quarter Iran's exports of carpets had amounted to $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carpetsymphony.com/blogs/rug-academy/persian-rugs-the-silent-war-on-decoration|author=Tajvidi K.|publisher=Rug Academy|title=Persian Rugs &amp; The Silent War On Decoration|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country produces about five million square metres of carpets annually—79 percent of which are sold in international markets.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=138668&amp;sectionid=351020102 Presstv.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826114740/http://presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=138668&amp;sectionid=351020102 |date=2010-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing reproductions of the original Iranian designs as well as cheaper substitutes.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"/&gt;

'''Philosophy of geography''' is the subfield of [[philosophy]] which deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[axiology|axiological]] issues in [[geography]], with geographic methodology in general, and with more broadly related issues such as the perception and representation of space and place.

Though methodological issues concerning geographical knowledge have been debated for centuries, [[Richard Hartshorne]] (1899–1992) is often credited with its first major systematic treatment in English, ''The Nature of Geography: A Critical Survey of Current Thought in the Light of the Past'', which appeared in 1939, and which prompted several volumes of critical essays in subsequent decades.  [[John Kirtland Wright]] (1891–1969), an American geographer notable for his [[cartography]] and study of the history of geographical thought, coined the related term [[geosophy]] in 1947, for this kind of broad study of geographical knowledge.  Other books oft-cited as key works in the field include [[David Harvey]]'s 1969 ''Explanation in Geography'' and [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s 1974 The Production of Space.  It was a discussion of issues raised by the latter which in part inspired the founding of a ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' in the 1990s.

The ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' was founded in 1997 by Andrew Light, a philosopher currently at George Mason University, and Jonathan Smith a geographer at Texas A&amp;M University.  Three volumes of an annual peer-reviewed journal, ''Philosophy and Geography,'' were published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield Press which later became a bi-annual journal published by Carfax publishers.  This journal merged with another journal started by geographers, ''Ethics, Place, and Environment,'' in 2005 to become ''Ethics, Place, and Environment:  A journal of philosophy and geography'' published by Routledge.  The journal was edited by Light and Smith up to 2009, and has published work by philosophers, geographers, and others in allied fields, on questions of space, place, and the environment broadly construed.  It has come to be recognized as instrumental in expanding the scope of the field of environmental ethics to include work on urban environments.

In 2009 Smith retired from the journal and Benjamin Hale from the University of Colorado came on as the new co-editor.  Hale and Light relaunched the journal in January 2011 as Ethics, Policy, and Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217145734/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the journal has since focused more on the relationship between environmental ethics and policy, it still welcomes submissions on relevant work from geographers.

A book series, also initially published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield, and later by Cambridge Scholars Press, began in 2002 to publish the transactions of the ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'''s annual meetings, organized by Gary Backhaus and John Murungi of Towson University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|title=IASESP Conference History|author=|date=2 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002045202/http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|archivedate=2 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the society sponsoring these annual meetings became the ''International Association for the Study of Environment, Space, and Place'', and in 2009 the book series gave way to a peer-reviewed journal, ''Environment, Space, Place'', published semiannually and currently edited by C. Patrick Heidkamp, Troy Paddock, and Christine Petto of Southern Connecticut State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|title=Environment, Space, Place - www.zetabooks.com|author=|date=9 July 2009|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709084916/http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|archivedate=9 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''postmaterialism''' is the transformation of individual values from materialist, physical, and economic to new individual values of autonomy and self-expression.

The term was popularized by the political scientist [[Ronald Inglehart]] in his 1977 book ''The Silent Revolution'', in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement.

Postmaterialism is a tool in developing an understanding of modern culture. It can be considered in reference of three distinct concepts of [[materialism]]. The first kind of materialism, and the one in reference to which the word postmaterialism is used most often, refers to [[economic materialism|materialism]] as a value-system relating to the desire for fulfillment of material needs (such as security, sustenance and shelter) and an emphasis on material luxuries in a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. A second referent is the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] held by many [[socialists]], most notably [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their philosophic concept of [[dialectical materialism]]. The third definition of materialism concerns the philosophical argument that matter is the only existing reality. The first concept is sociological, the second is both philosophical and sociological, and the third is philosophical.

Depending on which of the three above notions of materialism are being discussed, postmaterialism can be an [[ontology|ontological]] postmaterialism, an existentialistic postmaterialism, an ethical postmaterialism, or a political-sociological postmaterialism, which is also the best known.

==History==
The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by [[Ronald Inglehart]]. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized [[autonomy]] and [[Self-expression Values|self-expression]].{{sfn|Inglehart|2008}} Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs.

Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this [[silent revolution]] was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of [[generational replacement]] causing intergenerational value change.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971}}

The theory of intergenerational change is based on two key hypotheses:
* The scarcity hypothesis
* The socialization hypothesis

===The scarcity hypothesis===

Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart's interpretation of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human goals]], while [[scarcity]] prevails, these ''materialistic'' goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these "non-material" goods.{{sfn|Inglehart|1977}}

===The socialization hypothesis===

The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter.{{sfn|Rokeach|1968}} Therefore, [[cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] which often experienced economic scarcity would ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as [[individual]] improvement, personal [[freedom (political)|freedom]], [[citizen]] input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on [[humanism]], and maintaining a clean and healthy [[environmentalism|environment]].

Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during [[socialization]] have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]-system in contrast to the more volatile political and [[social attitude]]s.

===Measuring postmaterialism===
There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents' patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities.

{{quote|"If you had to choose among the following things, which are the ''two'' that seem the most desirable to you?
* Maintaining order in the nation.
* Giving people more say in important political decisions.
* Fighting rising prices.
* Protecting [[freedom of speech]]."

... On the basis of the choices made among these four items, it is possible to classify our respondents into value priority groups, ranging from a "pure" acquisitive type to a "pure" post-[[bourgeois]] type, with several intermediate categories.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971|pp=994–995}}}}

The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the [[validity (statistics)|validity]], the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted.

The so-called "Inglehart-index" has been included in several [[statistical survey|surveys]] (e.g., [[General Social Survey]], [[World Values Survey]], [[Eurobarometer]], [[ALLBUS]], [[Turning Points of the Life-Course]]). The [[time series]] in ALLBUS ([[German General Social Survey]]) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of "pure post-materialists" increased from 13 to 31 per cent in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by [[German reunification]] in 1990 it dropped to 23 per cent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards.{{sfnm |1a1=Terwey |1y=2000 |1p=155 |2a1=ZA |2a2=ZUMA |2y=2005}} The ALLBUS [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15 per cent, 1992: 10 per cent, 1998: 12 per cent). International [[data]] from the 2000 [[World Values Survey]] show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in [[Australia]] (35 per cent) followed by [[Austria]] (30 per cent), [[Canada]] (29 per cent), [[Italy]] (28 per cent), [[Argentina]] (25 per cent), [[United States]] (25 per cent), [[Sweden]] (22 per cent), [[Netherlands]] (22 per cent), [[Puerto Rico]] (22 per cent) etc.{{sfn|Inglehart|Basáñez|Díez-Medrano|Halmann|2004|p=384}} In spite of some questions raised by these and other data, measurements of postmaterialism have ''prima facie'' proven to be statistically important variables in many analyses.{{sfn|Kislev|2017}}

As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with [[asceticism]] or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class.{{sfn|Pappi|Terwey|1982}}

Recently, the issue of a "second generation of postmaterialism" appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their "positive ideological embodiment", has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series ''Postmaterialismus'' (2001–2005).

'''Procedural rhetoric''' or simulation rhetoric&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative"&gt;[[Gonzalo Frasca|Frasca, Gonzalo]] (2003). “Simulation versus Narrative: Introduction to Ludology.” In ''The Video Game Theory Reader''. Ed. by Mark J. P. Wolf and Bernard Perron. New York: Routledge. 221–37  {{ISBN|9780415965798}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a rhetorical concept that explains how people learn through the authorship of rules and processes. The theory argues that games can make strong claims about how the world works—not simply through words or visuals but through the processes they embody and models they construct.The term was first coined by Ian Bogost in his 2007 book Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"&gt;[[Ian Bogost|Bogost, Ian]] (2008). "The Rhetoric of Video Games." ''[https://mitpress.mit.edu/index.php?q=books/ecology-games The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning]''. Ed. by Katie Salen. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press. 117–40. {{ISBN|9780262693646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Bogost|Bogost]] is a professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication and in Interactive Computing in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Chair in Media Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}

Bogost argues that games make strong claims about how the world works by the processes they embody. Procedural rhetoric analyzes the art of persuasion by rule based representations and interactions rather than spoken or written word.  Procedural rhetoric focuses on how gamemakers craft laws and rules within a game to convey a particular ideology.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

==A New Rhetorical Theory==
The term “procedural rhetoric” was developed by [[Ian Bogost]] in his book ''Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames''.&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games"&gt;[[Ian Bogost|Bogost, Ian]] (2007). ''Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.  {{ISBN|978-0262514880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost defines procedural rhetoric as “the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures”&lt;ref&gt;‘Persuasive Games’ p ix&lt;/ref&gt; and “the art of using processes persuasively.”&lt;ref&gt;‘Persuasive Games’ p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Gonzalo Frasca]]’s preferred term of “simulation rhetoric” uses different language, the concept is the same: he envisions the authors of games as crafting laws&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 229&lt;/ref&gt; and that these authors convey ideology “by adding or leaving out manipulation rules.”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 231&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca defines simulations as “to model a (source) system through a different system which maintains (for somebody) some of the behaviors of the original system,”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 223"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 223&lt;/ref&gt; a definition that shows the importance of systemic procedures.

In coining this term, Bogost borrows [[Janet Murray]]’s definition of procedural from her book ''Hamlet on the Holodeck''—“a defining ability to execute a series of rules”&lt;ref name="Hamlet on the Holodeck"&gt;Murray, Janet (1997). ''Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace''. The Free Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;—to theorize that a different system of learning and persuasion could be found in computerized media. As Bogost suggests, “This ability to execute computationally a series of rules fundamentally separates computers from other media.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122"&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca likewise sees the need for new rhetorical theory because “simulations can express messages in ways that narrative simply cannot.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 225&lt;/ref&gt; In procedural rhetoric, these rules of behavior then create “possibility spaces, which can be explored through play.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 122"/&gt;

Procedural rhetoric also views games as strongly rhetorical—we “read games as deliberate expressions of particular perspectives.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 119&lt;/ref&gt;  The exploration of possibility spaces becomes rhetorical and instructive as soon as games make claims about aspects of human experience, whether they do so intentionally or inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 123&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca concurs that “video games are capable of conveying the ideas and feelings of an author”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 224&lt;/ref&gt; and “offer distinct rhetorical possibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 222&lt;/ref&gt; Game laws represent “the designer's agenda.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 233"&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 233&lt;/ref&gt; As Bogost traces the history of rhetoric back to classical Greece, he argues that, as theories of rhetoric have expanded from examining only verbal to including written and visual media, an expansion of rhetoric is now necessary to include the properties of procedural expression: “A theory of procedural rhetoric is needed to make commensurate judgments about the software systems we encounter everyday and to allow a more sophisticated procedural authorship with both persuasion and expression as its goal […] Procedural rhetoric affords a new and promising way to make claims about how things work.”&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125"&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Matt King summarizes the procedural and rhetorical sides of this theory, “By embodying certain processes and not others, by structuring a playing experience around particular rules and logics, videogames make claims about the world and how it works–or how it does not work, or how it should work.”&lt;ref name="Rhetoric's Procedures: Rhetorical Peaks and What It Means to Win the Game"&gt;King, Matt (2010). “Procedural Rhetorics - Rhetoric's Procedures: Rhetorical Peaks and What It Means to Win the Game.” ''Currents in Electronic Literacy: Gaming across the Curriculum''. {{cite web |url=http://currents.cwrl.utexas.edu/2010/king_procedural_rhetorics_rhetorics_procedures |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026035307/http://currents.cwrl.utexas.edu/2010/king_procedural_rhetorics_rhetorics_procedures |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogost overwhelmingly uses video games as the medium to clarify this concept because “they embody processes and rely upon players to enact them.”&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 44, 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does suggest that this theory could apply to other types of “play” and their possibility spaces: “For example, consider a game of hide-and-seek in which an older player must count for a longer time to allow younger players a better chance to hide more cleverly. This rule is not merely instrumental; it suggests a value of equity in the game and its players.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 121&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, procedural rhetoric would apply to board games such as Elizabeth Magie’s ''The Landlord Game'', a forerunner of ''[[Monopoly (game)]]'', that was designed to educate players on the negative outcomes of capitalism.&lt;ref name=Inventor&gt;Pilon, Mary (February 13, 2015). "Monopoly’s Inventor: The Progressive Who Didn’t Pass 'Go.'" ''New York Times''. Retrieved February 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca is much more explicit about the historical use of procedural rhetoric: “Simulation is not a new tool. It has always been present through such common things as toys and games but also through scientific models or cybertexts like the ''[[I-Ching]]''.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 223"/&gt;

==Procedural vs. Simulation Rhetoric==
Although Bogost and Frasca use different terms, their descriptions of this new type of rhetoric should be considered synonymous. Bogost sees procedural rhetoric in contrast to theories of verbal, written, and visual rhetoric,&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games p 125"/&gt; while Frasca coins the term “simulation rhetoric” to compare with narrative and drama as a form of representational storytelling. As he explains, “It is common to contrast narrative and drama because the former is the form of the past, of what cannot be changed, while the latter unfolds in present time. To take the analogy further, simulation is the form of the future. It does not deal with what happened or is happening, but with what may happen. Unlike narrative and drama, its essence lays on a basic assumption: change is possible.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 233"/&gt; The ways in which they discuss their concepts are nevertheless almost identical.

==Further Concepts of Procedural Rhetoric==
Expanding from the fundamental concepts of '''Procedural Rhetoric''', where the core concepts deal with rhetoric as means of learning through rules and processes,&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games" /&gt; there are extensions of other theories that contribute to the functionality of Procedural Rhetoric. In her article ''Game-based Pedagogy in the Writing Classroom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shultz Colby|first=Rebekah|title=Game-based Pedagogy in the Writing Classroom|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compcom.2016.11.002|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=43|pages=55–72|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2016.11.002|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebekah Schultz Colby, outlines how "games" can essentially be beneficial towards improving an individual's skill due to the nature of ''[[Multimodal interaction]],'' or better defined as ''Multimodal Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869461917|title=An evaluation framework for multimodal interaction : determining quality aspects and modality choice|last=Ina,|first=Wechsung,|isbn=9783319038094|location=Hedielberg|oclc=869461917}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the article. Though Schultz, only focuses on core principles of games and the effect of game instructions, this approach relates to [[Ian Bogost]]'s theory on how a pedagogical rule-based system can effect the outcome of a persons performance. Moreover, between the similarities of Bogost and Schultz's theories, it can be noted that there is a correlation between the rule based system, and the improvements of a persons skills.

==The Rhetoric of Gaming==
[[Rhetoric]] is the art of discourse wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular audiences in specific situations. Procedural rhetoric focuses on the composition of gameplay, more specifically how simulation games are constructed to make claims about how the world should work.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

James Gee, Professor at University of Wisconsin - Madison outlined the importance of video games for learning in his essay Why Video Games are Good For Learning, Gee describes commercial games as “worlds in which variables interact through time” .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gee|first1=James P.|title=What Video Games Have To Teach Us About Learning and Literacy?|date=December 26, 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=1403984530|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game-makers compose video games with a series of predetermined rules and processes that the play must follow in order to win. The player must learn the rules of the virtual world and deduce what is possible and impossible in order to solve problems and carry out the ultimate goal of winning. The requirement of learning the rules of video games is the baseline of the procedural rhetoric theory.

Researchers Jens Seiffert and Howard Nothhaft found that computer games are powerful persuasive tools that act as a manipulating force for society.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seiffert|first1=Jens|last2=Nothhaft|first2=Howard|title=The Missing Media: The Procedural Rhetoric of Computer Games|journal=Public Relations Review|date=June 2015|volume=41|issue=2|pages=254–263|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2014.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers cited a 2009 study finding that military computer games transferred to the players understanding of warfare. In particular, the logic of the game revealed by the procedural and structural rules guided players with a deeper comprehension of the rules of warfare and tactics in real life.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

Through the processes and rules of a simulation, game-makers have the ability to persuade players to view the world according to the procedures of a particular game. While contemporary rhetorics focuses on discourse as the art of persuasion, procedural rhetorics focuses on the gaming system, processes, rules, and procedures as a mean to persuade the audience, that being players.&lt;ref name="The Rhetoric of Video Games"/&gt;

==Procedural Rhetoric in Other Settings==
Elements of Procedural Rhetoric can also be found outside of video games. For example, Bogost references Bureaucratic processes that involve computers, such as banking. In banking, the actions available to account holders are limited and directed by the procedures built into the banking system such as interest, fees, credit, and money transfers. These factors incentivise account holders to take a variety of specific actions, such as spending to improve credit, saving to accrue interest, and more.&lt;ref name="Persuasive Games" /&gt;

Alec Slade Baker of San Diego State University argues that procedural rhetoric be used to study capitalist systems as well. In his masters dissertation, ''Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Alec Slade|title=Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|date=2017|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1986814804/abstract/AAF7687CA8704464PQ/1?accountid=14696|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he examines the rhetorical arguments created by customer service return policies at a variety of commercial businesses. According to him, forgiving return policies, Nordstrom’s communicate to customers a willingness to help and accommodate. On the other hand, strict return policies such as that of Dollar Tree reflect a hostile distrust of the customer that impacts the way they interact with those businesses.

Lucille A. Jewel of the University of Tennessee College of Law theorizes uses for procedural rhetoric in the courtroom setting in her scholarly article, ''The Bramble Bush of Forking Paths: Digital Narrative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewel|first1=Lucille A.|title=The Bramble Bush of Forking Paths: Digital Narrative, Procedural Rhetoric, and the Law|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Technology|date=2011|volume=14|pages=66–105|url=http://heinonline.org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/yjolt14&amp;div=4&amp;start_page=66&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, games or other interactive media could be used in the future to help explain complex legal concepts to juries, taking over the role that videos or other supplemental media now hold. This is because interactive media that uses procedural rhetoric can better illustrate the complexities of law on a case-by-case basis than static media.

==Critical Discourse==
Along with the development of Procedural Rhetoric in the greater Digital Rhetoric discourse, several counter-arguments critiquing the theory have been made as well. For example, Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas of the University of California, Santa Cruz critiqued the concept of procedural rhetoric in their conference paper, ''Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treanor|first1=Mike|last2=Mateas|first2=Michael|title=Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons|journal=DiGRA '09 - Proceedings of the 2009 DiGRA International Conference: Breaking New Ground: Innovation in Games, Play, Practice and Theory|date=September 2009|volume=5|url=http://www.digra.org/digital-library/publications/newsgames-procedural-rhetoric-meets-political-cartoons/|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the concept gave too much credit to game creators who often didn’t take the rhetoric supported by their systems into account during game design. For example, the 2004 flash game ''Madrid'' by Gonzalo Frasca,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frasca|first1=Gonzalo|title=Madrid|url=http://www.newsgaming.com/games/madrid/|website=Newsgaming.com|publisher=Newsgaming.com|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; created as a procedural rhetoric device discussing the 2004 Madrid train bombings, features a gameplay system that promotes frenetic, consistent, stressful action which is in direct opposition to the goal of creating empathy between the players and the people who were harmed.

Another major critique of Procedural Rhetoric is expressed by Miguel Sicart of the IT University of Copenhagen in his journal article, ''Against Procedurality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sicart|first1=Miguel|title=Against Procedurality|journal=The International Journal of Computer Game Research|date=December 2011|volume=11|issue=3|url=http://gamestudies.org/1103/articles/sicart_ap/|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sicart disagrees with Procedural Rhetoric because of how it focuses completely on the creator’s engineered experiences and systems, while ignoring the ability of the player to interact and change procedural systems in unforeseen ways. Specifically, he claims that the unique interests and goals of each player have the power to radically change the play experience, regardless of the author’s intent.

==Examples of Procedural Rhetoric==
Bogost describes three prominent categories through which procedural rhetoric manifests itself in video games: politics, advertising, and education. Frasca also suggests examples of rhetoric in each of these categories.

'''Politics'''

Although perhaps not overwhelmingly common, a number of games have made political arguments. Bogost shows the potential effect of procedural rhetoric on political values through ''The Howard Dean for Iowa Game''. He discusses how this game represents the “procedural rhetoric of politics,” claiming that “one amasses supporters in support of nothing more than support.”&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 328&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost also sees political content in the government-funded [[first-person shooter]] ''[[America’s Army]]'', arguing that the game “serves as a convincing procedural rhetoric for the chain of command, the principle structure new recruits must understand immediately.”&lt;ref&gt;The Rhetoric of Video Games p 130&lt;/ref&gt; America’s Army therefore privileges government values and authority, suggesting to players that they should uncritically accept the missions they are provided. Frasca cites a 2002 CBS report that Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura considered using video games for propaganda and mentions the wave of anti-Osama video games that erupted online after September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Simulation versus Narrative p 226&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising'''
 
Rhetoric focuses on persuasion, so it is no surprise that advertising would be present in some examples of procedural rhetoric. Bogost describes a possible effect of advertising procedural rhetoric in the game ''[[Animal Crossing]]''. Although the game is targeted to children, there are certain rare things in the game that can only be found during the late hours of the night, meaning that the child would have to ask permission to acquire this rare item or enlist the help of parent(s) to acquire it. Bogost argues that this could be incentivized by the parents—for example, “do your chores and I will let you stay up to get it”—which shows the persuasive effect video games could have on both the parent and the child.&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 334-335&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca sees advertising as especially prevalent in procedural rhetoric, arguing that advertisers “see in games a tool for persuasion” and noting the prevalence of product-based “[[advergames]].”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt; Advergames make it especially clear that games in general contain ideological content because players understand that advergames have an explicit agenda.&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt;

'''Education'''

Education and instruction is an inherent theme of procedural rhetoric; players learn from seeing their behaviors rewarded or punished. Bogost uses the ''[[SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon]]'' game (one of a number of simulation games about managing business franchises) as an example of the educational value of procedural rhetoric. In these games the player is tasked with creating a theme park, zoo, or other business and making it profitable. Although such games allow players to develop their businesses as they see fit, they ultimately require a successful business to progress and keep playing. This feedback process forces the player to learn how to manage a business and grow in knowledge as they play.&lt;ref&gt;Persuasive Games p 335&lt;/ref&gt; Frasca mentions the simulation games ''[[SimCity]]'' and ''[[The Sims]]'' as examples of procedural rhetoric and uses the handling of same-sex relationships as an example:
“[T]he way that ''The Sims'''s designers dealt with gay couples was not just through representation (for example, by allowing players to put gay banners on their yards), they also decided to build a rule about it. In this game, same-gender relationships are possible. […] By incorporating this rule, the designers are showing tolerance towards this sexual option.”&lt;ref name="Simulation versus Narrative p 225"/&gt;

[[File:Uhuru Design Cyclone Lounger.png|thumb|A lounge chair using reclaimed wood]]
'''Reclaimed lumber''' is [[processed wood]] retrieved from its original application for purposes of subsequent use. Most reclaimed [[lumber]] comes from timbers and decking rescued from old [[barn]]s, factories and warehouses, although some companies use wood from less traditional structures such as boxcars, [[coal mine]]s and [[wine barrel]]s. Reclaimed or antique lumber is used primarily for decoration and home building, for example for siding, architectural details, cabinetry, [[furniture]] and flooring.

==Wood origins==
In the [[United States of America]], wood once functioned as the primary building material because it was strong, relatively inexpensive and abundant. Today, many of the woods that were once plentiful are only available in large quantities through reclamation. One common reclaimed wood, [[longleaf pine]], was used to build factories and warehouses during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The trees were slow-growing (taking 200 to 400 years to mature), tall, straight, and had a natural ability to resist mold and insects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridata.com/ref/p/pinu_pal.cfm Floridata: Pinus palustris&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were also abundant. [[Longleaf pine]] grew in thick forests that spanned over {{convert|140000|sqmi|km2}} of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longleafalliance.org Longleaf Pine Forests and Longleaf Alliance Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Reclaimed [[longleaf pine]] is often sold as Heart Pine, where the word "heart" refers to the [[heartwood]] of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.longleaflumber.com/reclaimed-heart-pine/ Longleaf Lumber&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously common woods for building barns and other structures were [[redwood]] (Sequoia sempervirens) on the U.S. west coast and [[American Chestnut]] on the U.S. east coast. Beginning in 1904, a [[chestnut blight]] spread across the US, killing billions of American Chestnuts, so when these structures were later dismantled, they were a welcome source of this desirable but later rare wood for subsequent reuse. American Chestnut wood can be identified as pre- or post-blight by analysis of worm tracks in sawn timber. The presence of worm tracks suggests the trees were felled as dead standing timber, and may be post-blight lumber.

Barns are one of the most common sources for reclaimed wood in the United States. Those constructed through the early 19th century were typically built using whatever trees were growing on or near the builder's property. They often contain a mix of oak, chestnut, poplar, hickory and pine timber. Beam sizes were limited to what could be moved by man and horse. The wood was often hand-hewn with an axe and/or [[adze]]. Early settlers likely recognized American oak from their experience with its European species. Red, white, black, scarlet, willow, post, and pin [[oak]] varieties have all been used in North American barns.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Mill buildings throughout the Northeast also provide an abundant source of reclaimed wood. Wood that is reclaimed from these buildings includes structural timbers - such as beams, posts, and joists - along with decking, flooring, and sheathing. These buildings often have no economic or reuse possibility, can be a fire hazard, and may require varying degrees of environmental cleanup. Reclaiming lumber and brick from these retired mills is considered a better use of materials than landfill-based disposal.

Another source of reclaimed wood is old [[snowfence]]. At the end of their tenure on the mountains and plains of the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, snowfence boards are a valued source of consistent, structurally sound and reliable reclaimed wood.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.centennialwoods.com/blog/reclaimed-lumber.html Centennial Woods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other woods recycled and reprocessed into new wood products include [[coast redwood]], [[hard maple]], [[Douglas Fir]], walnuts, hickories, red and [[white oak|White Oak]], and [[Eastern white pine]].

==Properties==
Reclaimed lumber is popular for many reasons: the wood's unique appearance, its contribution to [[green building]], the history of the wood's origins, and the wood's physical characteristics such as strength, stability and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.terramai.com/pages.aspx?id=234|title=Why Reclaimed Wood?|website=www.terramai.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased strength of reclaimed wood is often attributed to the wood often having been harvested from virgin growth timber, which generally grew more slowly, producing a denser grain. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Reclaimed beams can often be sawn into wider planks than newly harvested lumber, and many companies claim their products are more stable than newly-cut wood because reclaimed wood has been exposed to changes in humidity for far longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://superior-hardwoods.com/top-10-reasons-to-choose-reclaimed-wood/|title=Top 10 Reasons to Choose Reclaimed Wood|website=www.superior-hardwoods.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclaimed lumber industry==
The reclaimed lumber industry gained momentum in the early 1980s on the West Coast when large-scale reuse of softwoods began. The industry grew due to a growing concern for environmental impact as well as declining quality in new lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.p2pays.org/ref/12/11761.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On the East Coast, industry pioneers began selling reclaimed wood in the early 1970s but the industry stayed mostly small until the 1990s as waste disposal increased and deconstruction became a more economically alternative to demolition. A trade association, the [[Reclaimed Wood Council]], was formed in May 2003 but dissolved in January 2008 due to a lack of participation among the larger reclaimed wood distributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0VCW/is_16_25/ai_55781815 Recycled lumber enjoys rebirth | Home Channel News | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed lumber is sold under a number of names, such as antique lumber, distressed lumber, recovered lumber, upcycled lumber, and others. It is often confused with [[salvage logging]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longleaflumber.com/reclaimed-wood-names-what-do-they-mean/ Reclaimed Wood Names: What do they mean?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==LEED==
The [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System is the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) benchmark for designing, building and operating green buildings. To be certified, projects must first meet the prerequisites designated by the USGBC and then earn a certain number of credits within six categories: sustainable sites, [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and design process. 

Using reclaimed wood can earn credits towards achieving LEED project certification. Because reclaimed wood is considered recycled content, it meets the 'materials and resources' criteria for LEED certification, and because some reclaimed lumber products are [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) certified, they can qualify for LEED credits under the 'certified wood' category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 Usgbc: Leed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}
With reclaimed material being so popular, it is becoming more difficult to source. With such a high demand, some sellers try to pass newer wood off as antique. 

It is also common (although not necessarily done intentionally) for species to be misidentified because it is difficult to tell the difference in older material unless it is cut open and examined, leaving the material less desirable. Professionals in the field and with established reclaimed wood enterprises do not have difficulty identifying the species.

Reclaimed lumber sometimes has pieces of metal embedded in it, such as broken off nails, so milling the material can often ruin planer knives, saw blades, and moulder knives. Nail-compatible saw blades are advisable for the same reason, as well as for safety.  The alternative is to remove all metal from the reclaimed lumber, which is a costly and tedious process commonly achieved by scanning each piece of wood with a metal detector and then manually pulling out all nails, bolts, bullets, screws, buckshot, and other miscellaneous metal hardware. This process can make the cost of reclaimed lumber higher than new lumber.

Many sources of reclaimed wood cannot verify what the wood might have been treated with over its lifetime. This uncertainty leads to fears of harmful offgassing of [[volatile organic compounds]] associated with lead paint or various stains and treatments that may have been used on the wood. These fears are particularly pressing when the wood is for an interior application.

[[Image:Religious syms.svg|thumb|Various [[religious symbols]]]]
'''Religious studies''', alternately known as the '''study of religion''', is an academic field devoted to research into [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While [[theology]] attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as [[deities]]),  religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including [[anthropology of religion|anthropology]], [[sociology of religion|sociology]], [[psychology of religion|psychology]], [[philosophy of religion|philosophy]], and [[history of religion]].

Religious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the [[Bible]] had flourished, and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist texts]] were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included [[Friedrich Max Müller]], in England, and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Cornelius P. Tiele]], in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.S. Adcock|title=The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UMfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, it was known as "[[comparative religion]]" or the '''science of religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular [[Mircea Eliade]], from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). 

The religious studies scholar [[Walter Capps]] described the purpose of the discipline as to provide "training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}} At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use "prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible."{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}}
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as "a subject matter" that is "open to many approaches", and thus it "does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status."{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xvii}}

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xvi}} Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=15}}

Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]] world.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=6–7}} It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=7–10}}

==Etymology==
The term "[[religion]]" originated from the Latin noun ''religio'', that was nominalized from one of three verbs: ''relegere'' (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); ''religare'' (to bind oneself [back]); and ''reeligere'' (to choose again).&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P.  ''Catholicism.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these three different potential meanings, an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term "religious" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a "religious").

==Defining "religion"==
[[File:Totem poles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Totem pole]]s reflect the beliefs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]; some religious studies scholars argue that the term "religion" is too Western-centric to encompass the beliefs and practices of communities such as these]]

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term "religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xviii}} Many of these have been ''monothetic'', seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define "religion" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Capps|1y=1995|1p=xviii|2a1=Herling|2y=2016|2p=37}} There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are ''substantive'', seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} The second are ''functional'', seeking to define "religion" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} Other forms of definition are ''polythetic'', producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}}

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various [[secularism|secular]] world views, such as [[nationalism]] and [[Marxism]], which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.{{sfn|Smart|1998|pp=22–26}}

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term "religion" altogether and cease trying to define it.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=36}} In this perspective, "religion" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism.{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}} According to scholar of religion [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], "many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever".{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=10}} There is, for instance, no word for "religion" in languages like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}}

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Before religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s,  several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[William James]]. His 1902 [[Gifford lectures]] and book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''[[The Will to Believe]]'' defends the rationality of faith.

[[Max Weber]] studied religion from an economic perspective in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in [[sociology]], he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
[[Émile Durkheim]] also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Max Muller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Müller]]]]Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[ca.]] 550 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and [[Herodotus]] (ca. 484 BCE &amp;ndash; 425 BCE). Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]]ic scholars such as [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064 CE) studied [[Zoroastrianism|Persian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Indian religions]], among others. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]. [[Peter the Venerable]], also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. [[Max Müller]] was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at [[Oxford University]], a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xv}}

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the [[University of Ibadan]], where [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Parrinder|first=Ursula|last=King|date=4 August 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093222/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', [[Ninian Smart]] wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[United States|America]], "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including [[Hinduism|Indian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]].)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of [[God]], belief and rationality, [[religious cosmology|cosmology]], and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''e.g.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]'s debate concerning original sin), the rise of [[scholasticism]] in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of [[Aristotle]]) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The [[anthropology of religion]] is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===
The [[cultural anthropology]] of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823202612/http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.&lt;ref name=GallupE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx|title=Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912113232/http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/religion-provides-emotional-boost-world-poor.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/religions-correlation-with-poverty/ between religion and poverty].

===Geography of religion===
The geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the "Berkeley school" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. 
Since the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the "politics and poetics" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest{{when|date=September 2018}} in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.

===History of religion===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the [[historicity]] of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M. Schultz and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', 78 (March 2010), 129–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''[[God: A Biography]]'', by [[Jack Miles]].

===Neurological approaches===
The [[temporal lobe]] has been of interest which has been termed the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) [[Neurological]] findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a [[SPECT]]scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Origin of religion===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Revelation}}
The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in [[prehistory]], before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. [[William James]]'s [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of [[religious conversion]], the making of religious decisions, [[religion and happiness]], and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

[[Sigmund Freud]] was another figure in the field of psychology and religion.  He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
{{main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the [[dialectic]]al relationship between religion and [[society]]; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[Concretization|reification]] of religious practise.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|economic foundations of society]]. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like [[France]] or [[Scandinavia]] outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?"&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Paul, "Cross-national correlations of quantifiable societal health with popular religiosity and secularism in the prosperous democracies," ''Journal of Religion &amp; Society'' (2005) 1#1 pp 1-17 [http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123104528/http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf |date=2014-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and religion ===
{{main|Law and religion}}
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new "law and religion" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the ''Journal of Law and Religion'' first published that year and the ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Howard J. | year = 1983 | title = A Survey and Commentary on the New Literature in Law and Religion | journal = Journal of Law and Religion | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 79–169 | jstor=1051074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics on interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elizabeth Mayer | first1 = Ann | year = 1987 | title = Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East | journal = American Journal of Comparative Law | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 127–184 | jstor=840165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pagan Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and film===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like [[Jean Epstein]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=16}}
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=13}} Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=14}}

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are [[hermeneutic]]s, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology ]] is "arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century." (Partridge)  The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of [[German Idealism]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], entitled [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]].  Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by [[Edmund Husserl]], who is considered to be its founder.  In the context of [[Phenomenology of religion]] however, the term was first used by [[Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye]] in his work "Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] influence, "phenomenology" came to "refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts." (Partridge)  Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is [[consciousness]].  He recognized "how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations." (Partridge)  Husserl introduced the term "eidetic vision" to describe the ability to observe without "prior beliefs and interpretations" influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the [[epoche]]: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator.  The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes.  In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.  Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]].  In his ''Religion in Essence and Manifestation'' (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within....The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to "acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self."
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which "all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate 'reality' thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation" (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817094359/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/phenom.htm source]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called "encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encountered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or "eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was "the distinctive method of the discipline".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion [[Thomas Ryba]] noted that this approach to the study of religion had "entered a period of dormancy".{{sfn|Ryba|2006|p=119}}
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with [[Robert A. Segal]] stating that it amounted to "no more than data gathering" alongside "the classification of the data gathered".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}

===Functionalism===
[[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]], in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Connolly|title=Approaches to the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0PUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to [[teleology|teleological]] explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the [[Pentateuch]] as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (''i.e.'' a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
[[Lived religion]] is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion "la religion vécue".&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall|David Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence.  Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which [[Anselm of Canterbury]] gave to it in the 11th century, [[credo ut intelligam]], or faith seeking understanding (literally, "I believe so that I may understand").  The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes.  The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M.

==Criticism==
A group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, [[Richard E. King]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with [[postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson.

==Scholarly journals==
Much of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Eidson, "Electronic journals in religious studies: Theological libraries prepare for the digital future."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">The ''Secretum philosophorum'' was a popular [[Latin language|Latin]] text originating in England c.1300–1350.
Ostensibly a treatise on the Seven [[Liberal arts|Liberal Arts]], it merely uses them as a framework in which to describe and demystify practical tricks, ‘tricks of the trade’ and applied science. 

==Sections==
Prologue (''Iste liber quem per manibus habemus vocatur Secretum Philosophorum.'')

Book I is nominally on ‘[[Grammar]]’ which ‘teaches us to write correctly’ (''Grammatica docet recte scribere et recte loqui''). Explaining that no-one can write correctly without the proper instruments, the subsequent text consists of technical recipes for the materials required ‘for correct writing’, plus some recipes for concealing meanings by the use of [[invisible ink]] and [[cipher]]s. Book I is thus in fact an [[:Category:Art technological sources|artists' recipe book]]. Book I thus includes recipes for [[pigment]]s, tempering, [[adhesive]]s, varnish, writing tablets, artificial [[pumice]] and [[invisible ink]], and for writing on metal by [[etching]]; many of these technical  recipes are unique, rare, variant or unusually early witnesses to practices, or clarify obscure recipes in other treatises; the instructions appear to be for amateur use. Book I then ends with homilies on ‘correct speaking’ (discretion and the dangers of lying), taken from the pseudo-Aristotle ''[[Secretum secretorum]]'', with a note on ‘[[weasel words]]’ for concealing meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.co.uk/ |title=Clarke, M. (2009) “Writing recipes for non-specialists c.1300: The Anglo-Latin Secretum Philosophorum, Glasgow MS Hunterian 110”, in '&amp;#39;Sources and Serendipity: Testimonies of Artists' Practice'&amp;#39; Edited by Erma Hermens and Joyce H Townsend, pp. 50-64 and Plate 18. London: Archetype Publications |publisher=Archetype.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book II, ‘[[Rhetoric]]’ ‘teaches ornate speech’ (''Rethorica docet ornate loqui''). It collects [[riddle]]s.

Book III, ‘[[Dialectic]]’ ‘teaches to discern between true and false’ (''Dialetica docet discernere verum a falso et ab apparenti vero''). It collects various tricks for deceiving the five [[senses]], with mirrors and conjuring tricks.

Book IV, ‘[[Arithmetic]]’ ‘teaches numbers per se’ (''Arismetrica docet de numero per se''). It rejoices in the multiplication of chains of immense numbers.

Part V, ‘[[Medieval music|Music]]’ ‘teaches the numbers of sound’ (''Musica docet de numero sonoro''). It describes the [[monochord]], and a recipe for [[catgut|gut]] [[String instrument|strings]].

Book VI, ‘[[Geometry]]’ ‘teaches magnitudes, i.e. to measure’ (''Geometria docet de magnitudinibus id est de mensuris quantitatum''). It gives practical tricks for measuring, especially buildings.

Book VII, ‘[[Astrology and astronomy|Astronomy]]’ ‘teaches movements of the heavens and their effects on men’ (''Astronomia docet de magnitudine mobili hoc est de motibus firmamenti et planetarum et eorum effectibus''). It is principally astrology, but includes a very early illustrated treatise on [[hydraulics]].

==Manuscripts, editions and translations==
Nearly 30 [[manuscript]]s of the ''Secretum philosophorum'' survive,&lt;ref&gt;Most of which are listed in Clarke 2009 ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; making it something of a medieval 'bestseller', and [[Lynn Thorndike]] considered the ''Secretum philosophorum''  to have formed part of the general intellectual furniture of most even partially well-read individuals, and urged its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/224682 Thorndike, Lynn "Prospectus for a Corpus of Medieval Scientific Literature in Latin" ''Isis'' Vol. 14 No. 2 (Oct. 1930) pp.368-384: p. 379 item 120]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, as yet no complete edition or translation has been published.

Book I: An edition and translation of the recipes for [[scribe]]s and [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminators]], together with a technical commentary, has been published by Clarke (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; which see for a list of surviving manuscripts.

Book II: Some of the riddles are edited (with suggested solutions) by Galloway (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2864706 Andrew Galloway, The Rhetoric of Riddling in Late-Medieval England: The "Oxford" Riddles, the Secretum philosophorum, and the Riddles in Piers Plowman, ''Speculum'' 70 (1995): 68-105]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Segmentation contractions}}
[[Image:Gray 111 - Vertebral column.png|thumb|100px&lt;!--Way too tall unless this # is small--&gt;|right|[[Vertebrate]]s have a segmented vertebral column.]]

'''Segmentation''' in biology is the division of some [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[body plan]]s into a series of repetitive segments. This article focuses on the segmentation of [[animal]] body plans, specifically using the examples of the taxa [[Arthropoda]], [[Chordata]], and [[Annelida]]. These three groups form segments by using a "growth zone" to direct and define the segments. While all three have a generally segmented body plan and use a growth zone, they use different mechanisms for generating this patterning. Even within these groups, different organisms have different mechanisms for segmenting the body. Segmentation of the body plan is important for allowing free movement and development of certain body parts. It also allows for regeneration in specific individuals.

== Definition ==

Segmentation is a difficult process to satisfactorily define. Many taxa (for instance the molluscs) have some form of serial repetition in their units, but are not conventionally thought of as segmented. Segmented animals are those considered to have organs that were repeated, or to have a body composed of self-similar units, but usually it is the parts of an organism that are referred to as being segmented.&lt;ref name="Budd2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G.

11710765| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
[[File:Illacme plenipes female with 170 segments and 662 legs (SPC000931) - ZooKeys-241-077-g006.jpeg|thumb|''[[Illacme plenipes]]'', a [[millipede]] with 170 segments and 662 legs]]
Segmentation in animals typically falls into three types, characteristic of different [[arthropods]], [[vertebrates]], and [[annelids]]. Arthropods such as the [[Drosophila|fruit fly]] form segments from a field of equivalent cells based on [[transcription factor]] gradients. Vertebrates like the [[zebrafish]] use oscillating [[gene expression]] to define segments known as [[somites]]. Annelids such as the [[leech]] use smaller [[blast cell]]s budded off from large [[teloblast]] cells to define segments.&lt;ref name = tautz&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz, D | title = Segmentation | journal = Dev Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–312 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15363406 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthropods===
[[File:Arthropod segment Hox gene expression.svg|thumb|Expression of [[Hox gene]]s in the body segments of different groups of [[arthropod]], as traced by [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. The Hox genes 7, 8, and 9 correspond in these groups but are shifted (by [[heterochrony]]) by up to three segments. Segments with maxillopeds have Hox gene 7. Fossil [[trilobite]]s probably had three body regions, each with a unique combination of Hox genes.]]

Although ''[[Drosophila]]'' segmentation is not representative of the [[arthropod]] phylum in general, it is the most highly studied. Early screens to identify genes involved in cuticle development led to the discovery of a class of genes that was necessary for proper segmentation of the ''Drosophila'' embryo.&lt;ref name = pick&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pick, L | title = Segmentation: Painting Stripes From Flies to Vertebrates | journal = Dev Genet | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9706689 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)23:1&lt;1::AID-DVG1&gt;3.0.CO;2-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To properly segment the ''Drosophila'' embryo, the [[anterior]]-[[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] axis is defined by maternally supplied transcripts giving rise to gradients of these proteins.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = pick /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peel AD |author2=Chipman AD |author3=Akam M | title = Arthropod Segmentation: Beyond The Drosophila Paradigm | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 905–916 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16341071 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gradient then defines the expression pattern for [[gap gene]]s, which set up the boundaries between the different segments. The gradients produced from gap gene expression then define the expression pattern for the [[pair-rule gene]]s.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; The pair-rule genes are mostly [[transcription factor]]s, expressed in regular stripes down the length of the embryo.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; These transcription factors then regulate the expression of [[segment polarity gene]]s, which define the polarity of each segment. Boundaries and identities of each segment are later defined.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt;

Within the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are segmented, as are the appendages (when they are present). Some of these elements (e.g. musculature) are not segmented in their sister taxon, the [[onychophora]].&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Annelids: Leech===

While not as well studied as in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]], segmentation in the [[leech]] has been described as “budding” segmentation. Early divisions within the leech embryo result in teloblast cells, which are stem cells that divide asymmetrically to create bandlets of blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Furthermore, there are five different teloblast lineages (N, M, O, P, and Q), with one set for each side of the midline. The N and Q lineages contribute two blast cells for each segment, while the M, O, and P lineages only contribute one cell per segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weisblat DA |author2=Shankland M | title = Cell lineage and segmentation in the leech | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 312 | issue = 1153 | pages = 39–56 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2869529 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1985.0176|bibcode = 1985RSPTB.312...39W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the number of segments within the embryo is defined by the number of divisions and blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Segmentation appears to be regulated by the gene [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], suggesting its common evolutionary origin in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids.&lt;ref name=Dray2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dray | first1 = N.| last2 = Tessmar-Raible | first2 = K.| last3 = Le Gouar | first3 = M.| last4 = Vibert | first4 = L.| last5 = Christodoulou | first5 = F.| last6 = Schipany | first6 = K.| last7 = Guillou | first7 = A.| last8 = Zantke | first8 = J.| last9 = Snyman | first9 = H.| last10 = Béhague | first10 = J.| last11 = Vervoort | first11 = M.| last12 = Arendt | first12 = D.| last13 = Balavoine | first13 = G.| title = Hedgehog signaling regulates segment formation in the annelid Platynereis| journal = Science| volume = 329| issue = 5989| pages = 339–342| year = 2010| pmid = 20647470| doi = 10.1126/science.1188913|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..339D | pmc=3182550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the annelids, as with the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are generally segmented. However, this is not true for all of the traits all of the time: many lack segmentation in the body wall, coelom and musculature.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Chordates: Zebrafish===
[[Image:Zebrafish Somitogenesis.png|thumb|left|[[Zebrafish]] form segments known as [[somites]] through a process that is reliant upon gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]], as well as periodic oscillation of gene expression.]]

Although perhaps not as well studied as ''[[Drosophila]]'', segmentation in [[zebrafish]] is actively studied. The process is similar in zebrafish and other [[chordates]], such as the [[chicken]] and the [[mouse]]. Segmentation in chordates is characterized as the formation of a pair of [[somites]] on either side of the midline. This is often referred to as [[somitogenesis]].

In the zebrafish, segmentation is coordinated by the [[clock and wavefront model]]. The "clock" refers to the periodic oscillation of specific genes, such as Her1, a hairy/Enhancer of split- gene. Expression starts at the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] end of the embryo and moves towards the [[anterior]]. The wavefront is where the somites mature, defined by gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]]. Retinoic acid is high in the anterior and FGF is high in the posterior; the wavefront is the point at which both concentrations are at their lowest. Cells at this point will mature and form a pair of somites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cinquin O | title = Understanding the somitogenesis clock: what's missing? | journal = Mech Dev | volume = 124 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 501–517 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17643270 | doi = 10.1016/j.mod.2007.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaboration of this process with other signalling chemicals allows for structures such as muscles to span the basic segments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Other taxa ===

In other taxa, there is some evidence of segmentation in some organs, but this segmentation is not pervasive to the full list of organs mentioned above for arthropods and annelids. One might think of the serially repeated units in many [[Cycloneuralia]], or the segmented body armature of the chitons (which is not accompanied by a segmented coelom).&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Segmentation can be seen as originating in two ways. To caricature, the 'amplification' pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the 'parcellization' framework is generally preferred – where existing organization of organ systems is 'formalized' from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt; As such, organisms with a loosely defined metamerism, whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), can be seen as 'precursors' to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8104">[[File:SIDS map en.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Small Island Developing States.]]
'''Small Island Developing States''' ('''SIDS''') are a group of small [[island countries]] that tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to [[natural disaster]]s, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on [[international trade]], and fragile environments. Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and [[infrastructure]] due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create [[economies of scale]].

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in June 1992. The [[Barbados Programme of Action]] was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.

==Embracing sustainability==

Many SIDS now recognise the need to move towards low-carbon, [[Climate resilience|climate resilient]] economies, as set out in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development. SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports.  Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable. Barbados has been successful in adopting the use of solar water heaters (SWHs). A 2012 report published by the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations. These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s. The report suggested that Barbados's experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/cdkn-inside-story-seizing-the-sunshine-barbados-thriving-solar-water-heater-industry/?loclang=en_gb ''Seizing the sunshine – Barbados’ thriving solar water heater industry''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of SIDS ==
Currently, the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] lists 57 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the [[Caribbean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caribbean|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1522|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Pacific]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pacific|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1523|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Africa]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[South China Sea]] (AIMS).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIMS|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1521|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the [[United Nations]] system. The [[UNCTAD]] website states that "the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS" but it maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD´s unofficial list of SIDS|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/aldc/Small%20Island%20Developing%20States/UNCTAD%C2%B4s-unofficial-list-of-SIDS.aspx|publisher=UNCTAD|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.artist concept.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of SNO's detector. (Courtesy of SNO)]]
The '''Sudbury Neutrino Observatory''' ('''SNO''') was a [[neutrino observatory]] located 2100&amp;nbsp;m underground in [[Vale Limited|Vale]]'s&lt;!--As it was known at the time--&gt; [[Creighton Mine]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The detector was designed to detect [[solar neutrino]]s through their interactions with a large tank of [[heavy water]].

The detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006.  The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken.

The director of the experiment, [[Arthur B. McDonald|Art McDonald]], was co-awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2015 for the experiment's contribution to the discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nobel-prize-physics-2015-1.3258178 |title=2015 Nobel Prize in Physics: Canadian Arthur B. McDonald shares win with Japan's Takaaki Kajita |date=2015-10-06 |journal=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permanent facility and now operates multiple experiments as [[SNOLAB]]. The SNO equipment itself is currently being refurbished for use in the [[SNO+]] experiment.

==Experimental motivation==
{{See also|Cowan-Reines neutrino experiment}}
The first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the [[Standard Solar Model]]. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]]. Over several decades many ideas were put forward to try to explain the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of [[neutrino oscillation]]s. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to [[electron neutrino]]s and yielded little to no information on [[muon neutrino]]s and [[tau neutrino]]s.

In 1984, [[Herb Chen]] of the [[University of California at Irvine]] first pointed out the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Direct Approach to Resolve the Solar-Neutrino Problem |first=Herbert H. |last=Chen |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=55 |issue=14 |pages=1534–1536 |date=September 1984 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1534|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55.1534C |pmid=10031848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other reaction sensitive to only electron neutrino.  Thus, such detector can measure neutrino oscillations directly.  A location in Canada was attractive because [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]], which maintains large stockpiles of heavy water to support its [[CANDU reactor]] power plants, was willing to lend the necessary amount (worth {{Currency|330 million|CAD}} at market prices) at no cost.&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/D2O.html |title=Heavy Water |date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creighton Mine in Sudbury, among the deepest in the world and accordingly low in background radiation, was quickly identified as an ideal place for Chen's proposed experiment to be built,&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt; and the mine management was willing to make the location available for only incremental costs.&lt;ref name=ANRV2009&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/papers/JelleyMcDonaldRobertsonAnnRev2009.pdf |title=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory |first1=Nick |last1=Jelley |first2=Arthur B. |last2=McDonald |authorlink2=Arthur B.

The SNO collaboration held its first meeting in 1984. At the time it competed with [[TRIUMF]]'s [[KAON Factory]] proposal for federal funding, and the wide variety of universities backing SNO quickly led to it being selected for development. The official go-ahead was given in 1990.

The experiment observed the light produced by [[special relativity|relativistic]] electrons in the water created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the [[Cherenkov effect]], and it is this light that is directly detected.

==Detector description==

[[File:Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.detector outside.jpg|thumb|The Sudbury Neutrino Detector (Courtesy of SNO)]]
[[File:Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.detector inside.jpg|thumb|A wide-angle view of the detector interior (Courtesy of SNO)]]

The SNO detector target consisted of {{convert|1000|t|ST|0|lk=on}} of [[heavy water]] contained in a {{convert|6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-radius}} [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] vessel. The detector cavity outside the vessel was filled with normal water to provide both [[buoyancy]] for the vessel and [[radiation shield]]ing. The heavy water was viewed by approximately 9,600 [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] (PMTs) mounted on a [[geodesic]] sphere at a radius of about {{convert|850|cm|ft|0}}. The cavity housing the detector was the largest in the world at such a depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Canadian Consulting Engineer |title=Deep Sphere: The unique structural design of the Sudbury {{sic|Neutrinos|hide=y}} Observatory buried within the earth |first=Robert |last=Brewer |date=&lt;!--Would really like to know--&gt; |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/neutrino/sno_deep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a variety of high-performance [[rock bolt]]ing techniques to prevent rock bursts.

The observatory is located at the end of a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} [[Drift mining|drift]], named the "SNO drift", isolating it from other mining operations. Along the drift are a number of operations and equipment rooms, all held in a [[clean room]] setting. Most of the facility is [[Class 3000 (standard)|Class 3000]] (fewer than 3,000 particles of 1&amp;nbsp;μm or larger per 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air) but the final cavity containing the detector is an even stricter [[Cleanroom|Class 100]].&lt;ref name=SNO2001&gt;

===Charged current interaction===
In the [[charged current]] interaction, a neutrino converts the [[neutron]] in a [[deuteron]] to a [[proton]]. The neutrino is absorbed in the reaction and an electron is produced. Solar neutrinos have energies smaller than the mass of [[muon]]s and [[tau lepton]]s, so only electron neutrinos can participate in this reaction. The emitted electron carries off most of the neutrino's energy, on the order of 5–15&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]], and is detectable. The proton which is produced does not have enough energy to be detected easily. The electrons produced in this reaction are emitted in all directions, but there is a slight tendency for them to point back in the direction from which the neutrino came.

===Neutral current interaction===
In the [[neutral current]] interaction, a neutrino dissociates the deuteron, breaking it into its constituent neutron and proton. The neutrino continues on with slightly less energy, and all three neutrino flavours are equally likely to participate in this interaction.  Heavy water has a small [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for neutrons, and when neutrons capture on a deuterium nucleus a [[gamma ray]] ([[photon]]) with roughly 6&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced.  The direction of the gamma ray is completely uncorrelated with the direction of the neutrino. Some of the neutrons wander past the acrylic vessel into the light water, and since light water has a very large cross section for neutron capture these neutrons are captured very quickly.  A gamma ray with roughly 2.2&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced in this reaction, but because the energy of the photons are not above the detector's energy threshold (meaning above the threshold for the photomultipliers), they are not directly observable. The gamma ray collides with an electron through Compton scattering and the accelerated electron can be detected through Cherenkov radiation.

===Electron elastic scattering===
In the [[elastic scattering]] interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts some of its energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral [[Z boson]], and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged [[W boson]]. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, and this is the channel through which the [[Super-Kamiokande]] (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of [[billiards]], and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.

==Experimental results and impact==
On 18 June 2001, the first scientific results of SNO were published,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the first clear evidence that [[Neutrino oscillation|neutrinos oscillate]] (i.e. that they can transmute into one another), as they travel in the sun. This oscillation in turn implies that neutrinos have non-zero masses. The total flux of all neutrino flavours measured by SNO agrees well with the theoretical prediction. Further measurements carried out by SNO have since confirmed and improved the precision of the original result.

Although Super-K had beaten SNO to the punch, having published evidence for neutrino oscillation as early as 1998, the Super-K results were not conclusive and did not specifically deal with solar neutrinos. SNO's results were the first to directly demonstrate oscillations in solar neutrinos. This was important to the [[standard solar model]].'''  '''The results of the experiment had a major impact on the field, as evidenced by the fact that two of the SNO papers have been cited over 1,500 times, and two others have been cited over 750 times.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other possible analyses==
The SNO detector would have been capable of detecting a [[supernova]] within our galaxy if one had occurred while the detector was online. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it is possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova is visible. SNO was a founding member of the [[Supernova Early Warning System]] (SNEWS) with [[Super-Kamiokande]] and the [[Large Volume Detector]]. No such supernovae have yet been detected.

The SNO experiment was also able to observe atmospheric neutrinos produced by [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the atmosphere. Due to the limited size of the SNO detector in comparison with Super-K the low cosmic ray neutrino signal is not statistically significant at neutrino energies below 1&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]].

==Participating institutions==
Large particle physics experiments require large collaborations. With approximately 100 collaborators, SNO was a rather small group compared to [[particle collider|collider experiment]]s. The participating institutions have included:

===Canada===
* [[Carleton University]]
* [[Laurentian University]]
* [[Queen's University]] – designed and built many calibration sources and the device for deploying sources
* [[TRIUMF]]
* [[University of British Columbia]]
* [[University of Guelph]]

Although no longer a collaborating institution, [[Chalk River Laboratories]] led the construction of the acrylic vessel that holds the heavy water, and [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] was the source of the heavy water.

===United Kingdom===
* [[University of Oxford]]  –  developed much of the experiment's [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] analysis program (SNOMAN), and maintained the program

===United States===
* [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBNL]]  –  Led the construction of the geodesic structure that holds the PMTs
* [[PNNL]]
* [[LANL]]
* [[University of Pennsylvania]]  –  designed and built the front end electronics and trigger
* [[University of Washington]]  –  designed and built proportional counter tubes for detection of neutrons in the third phase of the experiment

{{short description|set of 17 global development goals defined by the United Nations for the year 2030}}
[[File:UN SDG Logo.png|thumb|The Sustainable Development Goals are a UN Initiative.|269x269px]]{{redirect|SDG}}

'''Sustainable Development Goals''' ('''SDGs''') (or '''Global Goals for Sustainable Development''', the '''17 Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''the Goals"'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;: "Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "'''2030 Agenda'''."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|website=United Nations – Sustainable Development knowledge platform|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve. Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and economic development issues including [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[global warming]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 54 of [[ the United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/70/1 of 25 September 2015 contains the goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-led process involved its 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|Member States]] and global [[civil society]]. The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled "The Future We Want".&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/rio-20-summit-the-future-we-want/ |title=United Nations Official Document |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a non-binding document released as a result of [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] held in 2012.&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"/&gt;

Implementation as of 2016 is described as "Localizing the SDGs" to highlight the role of local institutions and local actors.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Regional efforts included agreements like the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]]&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;. Some remain pessimistic about the potential for achieving the SDGs, especially because of estimates of the cost of achieving all 17.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  However, progress had been reported by 2018. For example, fewer African children under the age of 5 are suffering from [[Stunted growth|stunting]] and wasting. However, the same study concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to [[malnutrition]] by 2030.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   {{TOC limit|3}}

In 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden, for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the United Nations created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as Agenda 21, was developed and adopted.

In 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]], was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliver2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-short-history-of-the-SDGs-Paula-Caballero.pdf|title=A Short History of the SDGs|last=Caballero|first=Paula|date=April 29, 2016|website=Deliver 2030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118221940/http://deliver2030.org/wp%2Dcontent/uploads/2016/04/A%2Dshort%2Dhistory%2Dof%2Dthe%2DSDGs%2DPaula%2DCaballero.pdf|archive-date=2017-11-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] 64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as "The Future We Want" was reached by member states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|title=Future We Want – Outcome document .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.

The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that “at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly’s Sixty-eighth Session &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposal|title=Home .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]]'s Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/700&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] from 2007 to 2016, has stated that: "We don’t have plan B because there is no planet B!."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/11/secretary-generals-remarks-to-the-press-at-cop22/|title=Secretary-General’s remarks to the press at COP22|date=15 November 2016|website=UN|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.&lt;ref name="post-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|year=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.&lt;ref name="post-2015"/&gt;

=== Ratification ===
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on Financing for Development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in New York City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda has 92 paragraphs. Paragraph 51 outlines the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the associated 169 targets.

== Implementation ==
[[File:B-1356@PEK (20180411153702).jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] of [[XiamenAir]] in Sustainable Development Goals [[livery]] in 2018]]
Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time.&lt;ref name="globalcitizen.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Global governance for SDGs|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/peer-pressure-can-contribute-achieving-sdgs-more-needed|author=Belay Begashaw|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 April 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent campaign "Project Everyone" has met some resistance.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africaplatform.org/news/why-this-is-sustainable-development-not-global-goals/|title=Why this is Sustainable Development Not Global Goals – Africa Platform|website=Africaplatform.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored "[[sustainability]]" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicywatch.org/blog/2015/09/25/public-sdgs-or-private-ggs/|title=Public SDGs or Private GGs? – Global Policy Watch|website=Globalpolicywatch.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that while "nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood-Zimmerman|first=Aaron|last2=Millear|first2=Anoushka I.|last3=Stubbs|first3=Rebecca W.|last4=Shields|first4=Chloe|last5=Pickering|first5=Brandon V.|last6=Earl|first6=Lucas|last7=Graetz|first7=Nicholas|last8=Kinyoki|first8=Damaris K.|last9=Ray|first9=Sarah E.|date=2018|title=Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7694|pages=41–47|doi=10.1038/nature25760|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" written by Ambassador David Donoghue, Felix Dodds and Jimena Leiva as well as "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by Macharia Kamau, David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek. 

===Europe and Russia===
Baltic nations, via the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], have created the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/|title=Sustainable Development - Baltic 2030 - cbss.org|work=cbss.org|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] has observed that UK and [[European Union]] [[pension fund|pension investors]] have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and [[early adopter]]s of “SDG-centric” investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Government of India]] established the [[NITI Aayog]] to attain the sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name=indgoal1&gt;[http://www.looppng.com/business/businesses-india-keen-govt-delegation-71103 Business in India keen: delegation] Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when [[Captain Abhimanyu]], Finance Minister of [[Government of Haryana]], unveiled a {{INRConvert|1151980|m|currency_formatting=c|lk=on|to=USD EUR|year=2018}} annual 2018-19 budget.&lt;ref name=ungoal1&gt;[Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights], India.com, 9 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement ==
[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]
UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals&lt;/ref&gt; They also shortened the title "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals" to "[[Global Goals]]/17#GlobalGoals," then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewdivision.world/global-goals-branding|title=the-new-division|website=the-new-division|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/slideshows/designing-the-global-goals-for-everyone|title=How This Great Design Is Bringing World Change to the Masses|date=2015-09-24|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalfestivalofideas.org/|title=Global Festival of Action – Global Festival of Action|website=globalfestivalofideas.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis approached Swedish designer [[sv:Jakob Trollbäck]] who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgoals.org/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Jakob Trollbäck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewdivision.world&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Le Temps Presse festival ===
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the Millennium Development Goals. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letempspresse.org/fr/le-festival/|title=Le Temps Presse|last=|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=Le Temps Presse|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17 goals==
There are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 304 indicators that will measure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/6754Technical%20report%20of%20the%20UNSC%20Bureau%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Technical report by the Bureau of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) on the process of the development of an indicator framework for the goals and targets of the post-2015 development agenda – working draft|date=March 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations General Assembly Draft outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda|website=UN|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal. Directly below each goal, in quotation marks, is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence. The paragraphs that follow present some information about a few targets and indicators related to each goal.

[[Extreme poverty]] has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, more than 1 in 5 people live on less than the target figure of US$1.25 per day. That target may not be adequate for human [[subsistence]], however. Some suggest it may be necessary to raise the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] figure to as high as $5 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/global-poverty-climate-change-sdgs/|title=The Problem with Saving the World {{!}} Jacobin|website=www.jacobinmag.com|access-date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources. People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social [[discrimination]], and exclusion from decision-making processes.

Children make up the majority – more than half – of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early [[pregnancy]] and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.

Achieving Goal 1 is hampered by growing inequality, increasingly [[Fragile state|fragile statehood]], and the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]].&lt;ref name="D+C/E+Z"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/eradicate-extreme-poverty-ultra-poor-need-be-reached|title=Programmes for the poorest of the poor|author=Jörn Geisselmann|date=29 April 2017|work=D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 2: Zero hunger ===
==== "[[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|End hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.

Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide,&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014. [http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/128045 An ambitious development goal: Ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025]. In 2013 Global food policy report. Eds. Marble, Andrew and Fritschel, Heidi. Chapter 2. Pp 15-28. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"/&gt;

=== Goal 3: Good health and well-being for people ===
==== "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-3-good-health-and-well-being.html|title=Goal 3: Good health and well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; 

Goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data for girls of greatest concern – those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000-2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15-19.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].

Goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of [[substance abuse]], deaths and injuries from [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]] and from hazardous chemicals and air, [[Water pollution|water]] and soil pollution and contamination.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

=== Goal 4: Quality education ===
==== "Ensure [[inclusion (education)|inclusive]] and [[educational equity|equitable]] quality education and promote [[lifelong learning]] opportunities for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-4-quality-education.html|title=Goali 4: Quality education|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the [[primary school]] level, for both boys and girls. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

Additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

=== Goal 5: Gender equality ===


==== "Achieve [[gender equality]] and [[empowerment|empower]] all women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-5-gender-equality.html|title=Goal 5: Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
According to the UN, "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.

[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 05. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – Indicators and a Monitoring Framework|url=http://indicators.report/goals/goal-5/|website=indicators.report|publisher=indicators.report|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated for "listening to girls". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Anna|title=21 ways the SDGs can have the best impact on girls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/21-ways-the-sdgs-can-have-the-best-impact-on-girls|accessdate=5 August 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has insisted on the transformational role [[Gender diversity|gender-diverse]] that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as “more than ever before, many UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation ===

{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 6}}

The [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]] (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"/&gt; Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed water services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. "Equitable sanitation" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the users.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt; This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko, Tan, Tay Keong, Flynn, Patricia M.|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If we are to meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) has made it its mission to achieve SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419043556/http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116185906/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|archive-date=2017-11-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance Knowledge Hub|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117064658/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|archive-date=2017-11-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ===
==== "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] and modern energy for all."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

As of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology, falling short of the 95 percent target.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ===
==== "Promote sustained, inclusive and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], full and productive employment and [[decent work]] for all."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren’t prioritized enough. Being prioritized as number 8 and number 9 respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking and defies common sense''"''&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"/&gt;

For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

By 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ===
==== "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Resilience (engineering and construction)|Urban resilience}}
Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ===
==== "Reduce income [[social inequality|inequality]] within and among countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries. "Duty-free treatment" has expanded. As of 2015, 65 percent of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free, as compared to 41 percent in 2005.

The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as [[Remittance|remittances]]). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical "remittance corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10|title=Progress of Goal 10 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 Nov 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goal Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities ===
==== "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html|title=Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and [[affordable housing]]. The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in [[Slum|slums]] or [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]. Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11|title=Sustainable Development Goal 11|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production ===
==== "Ensure [[sustainable consumption]] and production patterns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html|title=Goal 12: Responsible consumption, production|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Sustainable products}}
The targets of Goal 12 include using [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national [[recycling]] rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.

Target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12|title=Goal 12 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework, adopted by member states at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]], is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rio20.un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216-5_english.pdf|title=A/CONF.216/5: A 10-Year Framework of Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the [[One Planet Network]] have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/platform-sustainable-development-goal-12 Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 13: Climate action ===
==== "Take urgent action to combat [[Global warming|climate change]] and its impacts by regulating [[emission of greenhouse gases|emissions]] and promoting developments in [[renewable energy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html|title=Goal 13: Climate action|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the [[Financing for Development]] process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2015/december/COP21-paris-climate-conference.html|title=Paris Climate Change Conference: COP21|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Impact-of-climate-on-SDGs-technical-report-CDKN.pdf|title=The impact of climate change on the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development goals|last2=Greño, P|date=May 2015|publisher=CDKN &amp; HR Wallingford|last3=Houlden, V|display-authors=et al.|last1=Ansuategi, A|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around [[poverty]], [[gender equality]], and energy. The UN encourages the [[public sector]] to take initiative in this effort to minimize [[environmental impact|negative impacts on the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/no9.pdf&amp;embedded=true|title=Sustainable Development Innovation Briefs, Issue 9|last=|first=|date=March 2010|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial [[China–United States relations|Sino-American]] convergence that developed in 2015-2016, notably at the UN [[COP21]] summit (Paris) and ensuing [[G20]] conference (Hangzhou).&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth|title=Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth?|date=October 2016|work=Analyse Financière|first1=M. Nicolas J.|last1=Firzli|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Asia-Pacific region needs more [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCEOA Chairman Underscores the Value of Big Data for the SDGS |url=http://www.globalceoalliance.org/news-and-events/gceoa-chairman-underscores-the-value-of-big-data-for-the-sdgs/ |website=Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Press release |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 14: Life below water ===
==== "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html|title=Goal 14: Life below water|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Ocean]]s cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are essential for making the planet livable. [[Rainwater]], [[drinking water]] and climate are all regulated by [[ocean temperature]]s and [[ocean current|currents]]. Over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. Oceans absorb 30 percent of all [[carbon dioxide]] produced by humans.&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"&gt;UNDP2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein. However, there has been a 26 percent increase in [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] since the [[industrial revolution]]. A full 30 percent of [[marine habitat]]s have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world's [[fish stocks]] are [[overfishing|over-exploited]].&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Marine pollution]] has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"&gt;WWF2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} 20 percent of all [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;UN2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans. It has been found that 95 percent of [[Fulmar|fulmars]] in Norway have plastic parts in their guts.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Microplastics]] are another form of marine pollution.

Individuals can help the oceans by reducing their [[energy consumption]] and their use of plastics. Nations can also take action. In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tesdal Galtung |first1=Anders |last2=Rolfsnes |first2=May-Helen |title=Finn.no kjøper sekker med havplast |url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/finn.no-kjoper-sekker-med-havplast-1.13599585 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=NRK |date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, including Kenya, have [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags|banned the use of plastic bags]] for retail purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya plastic bag ban comes into force after years of delays |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41069853 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving the oceans contributes to [[poverty reduction]], as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.&lt;ref name="UN2016"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and [[coastal ecosystem]]s, and [[fishing regulation|regulating fishing]]. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fsustainabledevelopment%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf&amp;embedded=true&amp;chrome=false&amp;dov=1 [[chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg|link=]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 15: Life on land ===
==== "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, sustainably manage forests, combat [[desertification]], and halt and reverse [[land degradation]] and halt [[biodiversity]] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html|title=Goal 15: Life on land|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. Achieving a "land degradation-neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of [[introduced species]] and more protection of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/advocacy/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/mountain-green-cover-index/en/|title=Mountain Partnership: working together for mountain peoples and environment|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Mountain Partnership|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg15|title=Sustainable Development Goal 12|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development UN|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal extinction is a growing problem.

=== Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ===
==== "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide [[right to fair trial|access to justice]] for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions.html|title=Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Reducing [[violent crime]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and [[child abuse]] are clear global goals. The International Community values [[peace]] and [[justice]] and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also [[violence against women]]). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.

One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sdg16report.org/|title=SDG16 Data Initiative 2017 Global Report|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=SDG16 Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723064355/http://sdg16report.org/|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

SDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and [[Birth certificate|birth registration]], ensuring the right to a name and nationality, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals ===
==== "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for [[sustainable development]].“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-17-partnerships-for-the-goals.html|title=Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Increasing [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]] is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. [[Public–private partnership|Public-private partnerships]] that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17|title=Sustainable Development Goal 17|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-cutting issues ==
[[File:Sustainable Development Goals (Lima, Peru) 1.jpg|thumb|240px|Young people holding SDG banners in Lima, Peru.]]

=== Women and gender equality ===
There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically – by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen’s House: ESG and Asset Ownership|url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= Revue Analyse Financière|publisher=Revue Analyse Financière|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/POST-2015%20Gender.pdf|title=Gender equality and women’s rights in the post-2015 agenda: A foundation for sustainable development|format=PDF|website=Oecd.org|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and sustainable development ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives UNESCO, 2015 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf|title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100209-0|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education, gender and technology ===
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality [[Higher education|Higher Education]] to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 ("Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"&lt;ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

==Criticisms==

=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development. Finally, the MDGs used a  sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Whilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Competing goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
First, some of the SDGs might be contradictory. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] (as opposed to qualitative economic development and the goal of better distribution of the economic product) might undermine [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].

Second, the goal of achieving sustainable human population and lifestyle levels, and the scientific issues of matching ecosystems (and the Earth as a whole) to the number of human beings that they can sustainably support at a certain life-style level, seem neglected and largely unarticulated. Human population levels and reproductive rates are independent variables in trying to reach the SDGs and in aiming at an overall sustainable Earth/Human Community, they need to be scientifically recognized as such.

Third, in addition to population and lifestyle issues, three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the promotion of [[multidisciplinary]] and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;. 

Fourth, the issues of demilitarization, disarmament, and conversion to peace-based economies also seem neglected, along with the issues of corruption, drugs, robotization of jobs, the need for global citizenship education, the lack of reliable UN and SDG financing, and the current disempowering inability of citizens to participate directly in the global-level decision-making and priority-setting process and to thereby feel the collective togetherness needed for the success of the SDG effort.

=== Too many goals ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing.

=== High cost of achieving the SDGs ===
''The Economist'' estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2–3 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called "pure fantasy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847191468000296045/pdf/103172-PUB-Box394556B-PUBLIC-EPI-K8632-ADD-SERIES.pdf|title=The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene|last=Hutton|first=Guy|date=15 November 2017|website=Documents/World Bank|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms ===
Other views are more positive. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The Rockefeller Foundation asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|website=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|website=sphaera.world|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4004">'''Test compression''' is a technique used to reduce the time and cost of testing [[integrated circuit]]s.  The first ICs were tested with test vectors created by hand.  It proved very difficult to get good coverage of potential faults, so [[Design for test]]ability (DFT) based on scan and [[automatic test pattern generation]] (ATPG) were developed to explicitly test each gate and path in a design.  These techniques were very successful at creating high-quality vectors for manufacturing test, with excellent test coverage.  However, as chips got bigger the ratio of logic to be tested per pin increased dramatically, and the volume of scan test data started causing a significant increase in test time, and required tester memory.  This raised the cost of testing.

Test compression was developed to help address this problem.  When an ATPG tool generates a test for a fault, or a set of faults, only a small percentage of scan cells need to take specific values. The rest of the scan chain is ''don't care'', and are usually filled with random values.  Loading and unloading these vectors is not a very efficient use of tester time.  Test compression takes advantage of the small number of significant values to reduce test data and test time.  In general, the idea is to modify the design to increase the number of internal scan chains, each of shorter length.   These chains are then driven by an on-chip decompressor, usually designed to allow continuous flow decompression where the internal scan chains are loaded as the data is delivered to the decompressor.   Many different decompression methods can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Survey of Test Vector Compression Techniques |author=Touba, NA |journal=IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=294–303 |year=2006 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1683715 |doi=10.1109/MDT.2006.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One common choice is a linear finite state machine, where the compressed stimuli are computed by solving linear equations corresponding to internal scan cells with specified positions in partially specified test patterns.  Experimental results show that for industrial circuits with test vectors and responses with very low fill rates, ranging from 3% to 0.2%, the test compression based on this method often results in compression ratios of 30 to 500 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Embedded deterministic test |author=Rajski, J. and Tyszer, J. and Kassab, M. and Mukherjee, N. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=776–792 |year=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1291587 |doi=10.1109/TCAD.2004.826558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a large number of test chains, not all the outputs can be sent to the output pins.  Therefore, a test response compactor is also required, which must be inserted between the internal scan chain outputs and the tester scan channel outputs. The compactor must be synchronized with the data decompressor, and must be capable of handling unknown (X) states.  (Even if the input is fully specified by the decompressor, these can result from false and multi-cycle paths, for example.)  Another design criteria for the test result compressor is that it should give good diagnostic capabilities, not just a yes/no answer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">The '''tetraploid complementation assay''' is a technique in biology in which cells of two [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]]s are combined to form a new embryo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/130/25/6155 Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development], ''Development'' 130, 6155-6163 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to construct [[genetically modified organism]]s, to study the consequences of certain mutations on embryonal development, and in the study of [[pluripotency|pluripotent]] [[stem cells]].

==Procedure==
Normal mammalian [[somatic cell]]s are [[diploid]]: each [[chromosome]] (and thus every [[gene]]) is present in duplicate (excluding genes from X chromosome absent in Y chromosome). The assay starts with producing a ''tetraploid'' cell in which every chromosome exists fourfold. This is done by taking an embryo at the two-cell stage and fusing the two cells by applying an electrical current. The resulting tetraploid cell will continue to divide, and all daughter cells will also be tetraploid.

Such a tetraploid embryo can develop normally to the [[blastocyst]] stage and will [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]] in the wall of the [[uterus]]. The tetraploid cells can form the extra-embryonic tissue ([[placenta]] etc.), however a proper [[fetus]] will rarely develop.

In the tetraploid complementation assay, one now combines such a tetraploid embryo (either at the [[morula]] or [[blastocyst]] stage) with normal diploid [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ES) from a different organism. The embryo will then develop normally; the fetus is exclusively derived from the ES cell, while the extra-embryonic tissues are exclusively derived from the tetraploid cells.

==Applications==
* Foreign genes or mutations can be introduced into ES cells rather easily, and these ES cells can then be grown into whole animals using the tetraploid complementation assay.
* By introducing targeted mutations into the tetraploid cells and/or into the ES cells, one can study which genes are important for fetal development and which ones are important for development of the extra-embryonic tissues.
* The tetraploid complementation assay is also used to test whether [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (stem cells artificially produced from differentiated cells, e.g. from skin cells) are as competent as normal embryonal stem cells. If a viable animal can be produced from an induced pluripotent stem cell using the tetraploid complementation assay, then the induced stem cells are deemed equivalent to embryonal stem cells. This was first shown in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Lan Kang, Jianle Wang, Yu Zhang, Zhaohui Kou, Shaorong Gao. 2009. iPS cells can support full-term development of tetraploid blastocyst-complemented embryos.

The '''Underwater Demolition Teams''' ('''UDT''') were an elite special-purpose force established by the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. They also served during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Their primary function was to [[reconnoiter]] and destroy enemy defensive obstacles on beaches prior to [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] landings. They also were the [[frogmen]] who retrieved [[astronaut]]s after splash down in the [[Mercury program]] through [[Apollo program|Apollo]] manned space flight programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-before-the-first-mercury-splashdown/ |title=SEAL History: Before the First Mercury Splashdown &amp;#124; National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |publisher=Navysealmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDTs reconnoitered beaches and the waters just offshore, locating reefs, rocks, and shoals that would interfere with [[landing craft]]. They also used explosives to demolish underwater obstacles planted by the enemy. As the U.S. Navy's elite combat swimmers, they were employed to breach the cables and nets protecting enemy harbors, plant [[limpet mine]]s on enemy ships, and locate and mark [[Naval mine|mines]] for clearing by [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]]. They also conducted river surveys and foreign military training.

The UDTs pioneered [[Frogman|combat swimming]], [[Rebreather|closed-circuit diving]], [[underwater demolition]]s, and [[midget submarine]] (dry and [[Wet sub|wet]] submersible) operations. They were the precursor to the present-day [[United States Navy SEALs]].&lt;ref name="frogmen"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Frogmen of World War II: An Oral History of the U.S. Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams |last=Cunningham  |first=Chet  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Pocket Star |location= |isbn=978-0-7434-8216-5  |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ifnvAC5IoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Frogmen%20of%20World%20War%20II%3A%20An%20Oral%20History%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Navy's%20Underwater%20Demolition%20Teams&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, after additional SEAL training, the UDTs were re-designated as SEAL Teams or [[Swimmer Delivery Vehicle]] Teams (SDVTs). SDVTs have since been re-designated [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Early history ==
The United States Navy studied the problems encountered by the disastrous [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landings]] during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] of [[World War I]]. This contributed to the development and experimentation of new landing techniques in the mid-1930s. In August 1941, landing trials were performed and one hazardous operation led Second Lieutenant Lloyd E. Peddicord to be assigned the task of analyzing the need for a [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] (HUMINT) capability.&lt;ref name="frogmen"/&gt;

When the U.S. entered World War II, the Navy realized that in order to strike at the [[Axis powers]] the U.S. forces would need to perform a large number of amphibious attacks. The Navy decided that men would have to go in to reconnoiter the landing beaches, locate obstacles and defenses, as well as guide the landing forces ashore. In August 1942, Peddicord set up a recon school for his new unit, [[Navy Scouts and Raiders]], at the amphibious training base at [[Little Creek, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="frogmen"/&gt;

In 1942, the [[United States Army|Army]] and Navy jointly established the Amphibious Scout and Raider School at [[Fort Pierce]], [[Florida]]. Here [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Phil H. Bucklew]], the "Father of Naval Special Warfare", helped organize and train what became the Navy's [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command#First group|'first group']] to specialize in amphibious raids and tactics.

Pressure to further implement human intelligence gathering prior to landings heightened after Naval amphibious landing craft were damaged by [[coral reef]]s during the [[Battle of Tarawa]] in November 1943.  [[Aerial reconnaissance]] incorrectly showed the reefs were submerged deep enough to allow the landing craft to float over. Sailors and Marines were forced to abandon their craft in chest deep water a thousand yards from shore, helping [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]] gunners inflict heavy U.S. casualties.&lt;ref name="frogmen"/&gt; After that experience, [[Richmond K. Turner|Admiral Kelley Turner]], Commander of the 5th Amphibious Force, directed that 30 officers and 150 enlisted men be moved to [[Bellows Air Force Station|Waimanalo ATB]] (on the island of Oahu) to form the nucleus of a reconnaissance and demolition training program. It is here that the UDTs of the Pacific were born.&lt;ref name="navysealmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii/ |title=SEAL History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare-WWII &amp;#124; National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |publisher=Navysealmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in war, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Engineers]] passed down demolition jobs to the U.S. Navy. It then became the Navy's responsibility to clear any obstacles and defenses in the near shore area.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A memorial to the founding of the UDT has been built at Bellows Air Force Station near the original Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Waimanalo.

==Naval Combat Demolition Units==
[[File:NCDU1.jpg|thumb|U.S. Naval Combat Demolition insignia. – U.S. Navy Seal Museum]]
In early WWII it became apparent that in addition to the Scouts and Raiders, the Navy needed a group of specialists to destroy obstacles, man-made or natural, for amphibious landings. In late 1942, a group of Navy salvage personnel received a one-week concentrated course on demolitions, explosive cable cutting and commando raiding techniques. The Navy Scouts and Raiders unit was first employed in [[Operation Torch|Operation ''Torch'']], the invasion of [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] in November 1942.&lt;ref name="Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly"&gt;{{cite book | first=Bruce F. | last=Meyers | title=Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942–1945 | publisher=Naval Institute Press | date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Torch'', this unit cut the cable and net barrier across a river in [[North Africa]], allowing [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] to land upstream and capture an airfield.

In early May 1943, a two-phase "Naval Demolition Project" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) "to meet a present and urgent requirement". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school for a four-week course.&lt;ref name="seabeemagazine.may14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2017/05/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-may-14/ |first=Frank A. |last=Blazich |title=This Week in Seabee History (Week of May 14) |date=12 May 2017 |website=Seabee Online |publisher=Navy Facilities Engineering Command |accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KarnowskiNCDU-45"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/06/06/opening-omaha-beach-ensign-karnowski-and-ncdu-45/ |first=Frank A. |last=Blazich |title=Opening Omaha Beach: Ensign Karnowski and NCDU-45 |date=6 June 2014 |website=Seabee Online |publisher=Navy Facilities Engineering Command |accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those Seabees were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily&lt;ref name="navysealmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare – WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were divided in three groups that landed on the beaches near [[Licata]], [[Gela]] and [[Scoglitti]].&lt;ref&gt;pp. 30-31 Dockery &amp; Brutsman&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1943 the Navy decided to create a large dedicated force for such tasks: the Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDU) consisting of one officer and five enlisted.  A NCDU was to clear beach obstacles for an invasion force with the team coming ashore in an [[LCRS]] [[inflatable boat]].&lt;ref&gt;p.34 Dockery, Kevin &amp; Brutsman, Bud ''Navy SEALs A History of the Early Years'' Berkely Publishing 2001&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], the CNO, picked Lieutenant Commander [[Draper L. Kauffman]] [[United States Navy Reserve|USNR]] to lead the training. The first six classes graduated from "Area E" at NTC Camp Peary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/NCDU.htm | title=Naval Combat Demolition Units | website=SpecWarNet.net | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there the NCDU training was moved to Fort Pierce.  Despite the move, Camp Peary was Kauffman's source of manpower.  "He would go up to Camp Peary and the Dynamite School, assemble the (Seabees) in the auditorium and say, 'I need volunteers for hazardous, prolonged and distant duty.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailypress.com/features/history/dp-nws-evg-camp-peary-seabees-20171110-story.html | title=Training the Fighting Seabees of WWII at Camp Peary | work=Daily Press | date=3 December 2017 | first=Mark St. John | last=Erickson | location=Newport News, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the force meant recruitment beyond the pool of experienced combat swimmers. Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabees]] (the Navy's Construction Battalions), the U.S. Marines, and U.S. Army [[combat engineer]]s. Training commenced with one grueling week designed to "separate the men from the boys". Some said that "the men had sense enough to quit, leaving Kauffman with the boys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fleet at Flood Tide: America at Total War in the Pacific, 1944–1945 | first=James D. | last=Hornfischer | date=2017 | publisher=Bantam Books | location=New York | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was and is still considered the first "Hell Week."

Kauffman's experience was at disarming explosives; now he and his teams were learning to use them offensively. One innovation was to use {{convert|2.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} packs of [[tetryl]] placed into rubber tubes, thus making {{convert|20|lb|kg|adj=on}} lengths of explosive tubing that could be twisted around obstacles for demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navysealmuseum.com/home-to-artifacts-from-the-secret-world-of-naval-special-warfare/world-war-ii-era-beach-obstacles-and-hedgehogs-from-original-ncdu-school/ |title=World War II Era Beach Obstacles and Hedgehogs from Original NCDU School &amp;#124; National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |publisher=NavySealMuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normandy ===

At the beginning of November 1943, six men from Kauffman's Naval Combat Demolition Unit Eleven (NCDU-11) were sent to [[England]] to start preparations for the [[Normandy invasion]].  Later NCDU-11 was enlarged into 13-man assault teams. Weeks before the invasion, all available Underwater Demolition men were sent from Fort Pierce to England. By June 1944, 34 NCDU teams were deployed in England.  The NCDUs at Normandy were numbers: 11, 22-30, 41-46, 127-8, 130-42&lt;ref name= "NCDU Report"&gt;REPORT ON NAVAL COMBAT DEMOLITION UNITS in OPERATION "NEPTUNE" as part of TASK FORCE 122, Submitted by: Lt.(jg) H. L. Blackwell, Jr. D-V(G) , USNR, 5 July, 1944.[https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Normandy/CTF-122-NCDU.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

They were on Omaha beach with Ens. Karnowski earning the Navy Cross &amp;French [[Croix de Guerre]] with Palm, while MM2 Meyers received the Silver Star&lt;ref name="KarnowskiNCDU-45" /&gt;.]]
The Germans had constructed intricate defenses on the French line. These included steel posts driven into the sand and topped with explosives. Large 3-ton steel barricades called [[Cointet-element|Belgian Gates]] were placed well into the surf zone. Reinforced [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and machine gun nests were dotted along the beaches.

The Scouts and Raiders spent weeks gathering information during nightly surveillance missions up and down the French coast. Replicas of the Belgian Gates were constructed on the south coast of England for the NCDUs to practice demolitions on. It was possible to blow a gate to pieces, but that only created a mass of tangled debris spread along the beaches, thereby creating more of an obstacle. The NCDU found that the best method was to sever the key corner joints in a gate, so that it fell down flat.

According to the Allied attack plans, infantry supported by naval gunfire would make the initial landings, followed by tanks and troop carriers to clear any remaining German bunkers and snipers. The NCDU teams (designated Demolitions Gap-Assault teams) would come in with the second wave and work at low tide to clear the obstacles. Their mission was to open sixteen {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wide corridors for the landing at each of the U.S. landing zones ([[Omaha Beach]] and [[Utah Beach]]). Unfortunately, the plans could not be executed as laid out. The preparatory air and naval bombardment was ineffective, leaving many German guns in position to fire on the attackers. Also, tidal conditions caused many of the NCDU teams to land prematurely – in some cases ahead of the first wave. Despite heavy German fire and resulting casualties, the NCDU men planted charges and demolished many obstacles. As the infantry came ashore, some soldiers took cover on the seaward sides of obstacles that had demolition charges on them. They quickly moved onto the beach. The greatest difficulty was on Omaha Beach. By nightfall only thirteen of the planned sixteen gaps were open, and of the 175 NCDU men who went ashore there, 31 were killed and 60 were wounded.  The attack on Utah Beach was much more successful. There, only four were killed and eleven wounded, when an artillery shell hit a team working to clear the beach.&lt;ref name="navysealmuseum1"/&gt;  Overall, NCDUs had 53 percent casualties.

NCDUs also participated in [[Operation Dragoon|Operation ''Dragoon'']], the invasion of southern [[France]].

With Europe invaded most of the NCDUs were sent to Fort Pierce and integrated into the UDTs for the Pacific campaign.  However, the first NCDUs, 1-10, had been staged at Turner City, [[Florida Island]] in the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]] during January 1944.&lt;ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25"&gt;{{cite book | title=World War II US Navy Special Warfare Units | first=Eugene | last=Liptak | publisher=Osprey Publishing | location=New York | year=2014 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few were temporarily attached to UDTs.&lt;ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25"/&gt; Later NCDUs 1-10 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able.&lt;ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25"/&gt;  This team was disbanded with NCDUs 2 and 3, plus three others assigned to MacArthur's 7th Amphibious force, and were the only NCDUs remaining at war's end.  The other men from Team Able were assigned to numeric UDTs.

==  Underwater Demolition Teams ==
The first  units that were designated as Underwater Demolition Teams were formed in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]].  [[Richmond K. Turner|Admiral Kelly Turner]], the Navy's top amphibious expert, ordered the formation of nine Underwater Demolition Teams. As with the NCDUs in [[Europe]], the personnel for these teams were mostly [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]]s. UDT training was at [[Waimānalo, Hawaii]], on [[Oahu]] under the aegis of [[V Amphibious Corps|V (Fifth) Amphibious Force]]. Among both instructors and trainees, there were graduates of the Fort Pierce schools (Scouts and Raiders, and NCDU men), Seabees, Marines, and Army soldiers. Under the direction of [[United States Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion|Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance Company]], they hastily trained for the attack on [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] on 31 January 1944.&lt;ref name="Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly" /&gt;  The training made use of [[Inflatable boat#World War II|inflatable boat]]s and included little swimming. The men were expected to paddle in, and work in shallow water, leaving the deep-water demolitions to the Army. Marine Reconnaissance units would conduct the [[hydrographic survey|hydrography]] from shallow water to inland while the accompanying UDT would conduct the demolition and hydrography from near-deep water to the shallows.  At that time the men in the teams wore Navy fatigues with boots and helmets. They were lifelined to their boats and stayed out of the water as much as possible.

The UDTs were organized with approximately sixteen officers and eighty men each. One Marine and one Army officer were liaisons within each team.&lt;ref&gt;Commander, V Amphibious Corps to CinCPac, report, ''Underwater Demolition Teams, Recommendations Concerning-Based on Experience in Flintlock (Kwajalein)'', 2 June 1944, declassified from secret.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became apparent that a UDT assigned to the same beach as a Marine unit should be embarked in the same [[high speed transport]] (APD).   The UDTs were deployed in every major [[amphibious landing]] in the Pacific with 34 teams eventually being established.  The last teams created for the invasion of Japan were spared deployment by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atomic bombs]].  When it was over teams 1-21 were the ones operationally used meaning that slightly over half of the operational UDTs came from the Seabees.

===Tarawa===
The [[Battle of Tarawa|invasion of Tarawa]] in November 1943 nearly met disaster due to obstacles in the surf. Tarawa lies in eastern [[Micronesia]]. The islands in this region have unpredictable tides and are surrounded by shallow reefs that block even shallow-draft craft, except at a few narrow channels or at high tide. At Tarawa, an unusual [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|neap tide]] (a condition that results from the tide not rising or lowering as usual) occurred, leaving insufficient clearance for the [[LCVP (United States)|Higgins boats (LCVPs)]] to get over the reef. The [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|Amtracs]] carrying the first wave crossed the reef successfully. But the LCVPs carrying the second wave ran aground on the reef. The Marines had to unload and wade several hundred yards across the lagoon to shore while wearing full packs, under constant heavy fire from shore defenses. Many drowned or were killed before making the beach. The first wave, fighting without reinforcements from the second wave, took heavy losses on the beach. It was a painful lesson that the Navy would not permit to be repeated. 

===Kwajalein===
The next objective was [[Kwajalein]] and the original plan called for night reconnaissance. However, Admiral Turner did not want a repeat of Tarawa and wanted to know about the coral and any obstacles the Japanese may have emplaced.  To find this out, UDT 1 was ordered to do two daylight recons.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDvNvnMrc1QC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;lpg=PT26&amp;dq=UDT+kwajalein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c7lwL9DtOZ&amp;sig=Yt4KzhmWEkMpHB5PnuVDWJVIByg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFr4bIj_bVAhWl64MKHf2jBiEQ6AEIWTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=UDT%20kwajalein&amp;f=false | title=Seals At War | first=Edwin P. | last=Hoyt | publisher=Dell Books | location=New York, New York | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In keeping with the Seabee traditions of: (1) doing whatever it takes to accomplish the job and (2) not always following military rules to get it done, UDT 1 did both.  The missions were to follow the standard procedure with each two-man team getting close to the beach in a rubber boat, wearing full fatigues, boots, life jackets, and metal helmets, and then make their observations. But Team 1 found that the coral reef kept their craft too far from shore to be certain of the beach conditions. Ensign Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief Bill Acheson had anticipated that they would not be able to carry out the assignment following the Fort Pierce model and had worn swim trunks beneath their fatigues.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;  Stripping down, they swam 45 minutes undetected across the reef. When they returned with sketches of gun emplacements and other vital intelligence, they were taken, still in their trunks, directly to Admiral Turner's flagship to report.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;   Afterwards Admiral Turner concluded that the only way to get this kind of information was from individual swimmers, and he relayed those thoughts to Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz|Nimitz]], [[Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet|Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]].  The planning and decisions of Admiral Turner, Ensign Lehrs and Chief Achenson made Kwajalein a transition point in UDT history, changing both the mission model and training regimen.  Seabees made up the majority of the men in teams 1–9 and 13.  The Officers of those teams were primarily CEC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-sept-11/ | website=Seabee Online | publisher=Navy Facilities Engineering Command | title=This Week in Seabee History | first=Frank A., Jr. | last=Blazich | date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Seabees).  After Kwajalein, the UDTs created the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base at [[Kihei, Hawaii|Kihei]], next to the Amphibious Base at Kamaole on [[Maui]], expanding upon what had been learned from UDT 1. Operations began in February 1944. Most of the procedures from Fort Pierce were changed.  They were replaced with an emphasis on developing strong swimmers, daylight reconnaissance, and training without lifelines.  The uniform of the day changed to [[diving mask]]s, swim trunks, fins and a [[Ka-bar]], creating the image of the UDTs as the "Naked Warriors."

===Peleliu, Philippines, Guam, and Iwo Jima===
In April, Draper Kauffman was transferred from Fort Pierce to command UDT 5 and serve as senior staff officer, Underwater Demolition Teams, Amphibious Forces, and Underwater Demolition Training Officer, Amphibious Training Command.

UDTs 6 &amp; 7 drew the [[Peleliu]] assignment while UDT 8 went to [[Angaur]].   The officers were almost all CEC and the enlisted were Seabees.&lt;ref&gt;This Week in Seabee History, Sept 10-17, for Sept 12, Seabee Magazine online[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2017/09/10/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-september-10-september-16/]&lt;/ref&gt;

UDT 10 was directly under the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. It had a secret base on [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], before the Maui base was operational.  When the team was being formed it was joined by five officers and 21 men who had been trained by the OSS.  They were led by a Lt A.O. Chote Jr., who was made UDT 10's commanding officer.

UDT 14 was the first all-Navy team (one of three from the Pacific fleet).

[[File:Seabee Demolition UDT 3.jpg|thumb|Seabee welcome sign for the U.S. Marine Corps on Guam. – U.S. Navy]]

The landings in the Pacific Theater continued. Kauffman led UDT 5 in a daylight recon of the defenses of [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] and in a night recon of the defenses of [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]].  Two days ahead of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion of Iwo Jima]]  UDTs 12, 13, 14, and 15 reconnoitered the beaches suffering only one man wounded. However, the next day a Japanese plane bombed UDT 15's APD, the {{USS|Blessman|DE-69|6}}. Fifteen men were killed, and 23 were injured. This was the single largest loss of life suffered by the UDTs.  At Iwo Jima the teams not only did reconnaissance but on D-plus 2 were called upon to help clear the beaches of broached or damaged landing craft. The water's edge had become so clogged with debris that there was no place for landing craft to get ashore.  Later UDT 15 reconnoitered beaches at [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]].

UDTs also served at [[Eniwetok]], [[Ulithi]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen Gulf]], [[Zambales]], [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]], and [[Brunei]] Bay. The last UDT demolition operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]].

===Okinawa===
The largest UDT operation was in support of the invasion of [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]], in March 1945. Veteran UDTs 7, 12, 13, and 14, and newly trained UDTs 11, 16, 17, and 18 participated: nearly 1,000 men in all.  Up to that time, all UDT missions in the Pacific had been in warm tropical waters. Now the forces moved north toward Japan where the waters around Okinawa were cool enough that long immersion could cause hypothermia and severe cramps. Since they wore no thermal protection at that time, the UDTs were at risk to these hazards during their operations around Okinawa.

Operations included both real reconnaissance and demolition at the actual invasion site, and feints to create the illusion of landings in other locations. Pointed poles set into the coral reef of the beach protected the landing beaches on Okinawa. UDTs 11 and 16 were sent in to blast the poles. After all the charges were set, the men swam clear. The explosions took out all of UDT 11's targets and half of UDT 16's. UDT 16 aborted the operation due to the death of one of their men; hence, their mission was considered a failure and a disgrace. UDT 11 was sent back the following day to finish the job, and then remained to guide the forces to the beach.

The UDTs continued to prepare for the invasion of Japan until Japan surrendered in August 1945, and their role in the Pacific came to an end. Within months of the war's end, the UDT teams were decommissioned and reduced to only two partial teams. This ended a trying but evolutionary time in the history of Naval Special Warfare.&lt;ref name="navysealmuseum1"/&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:NH 71599.jpg|thumb|Lt Cmdr. Edward P. Clayton, (back to camera) Commanding Officer UDT 21, receiving the first sword surrendered to an American force in the Japanese Home islands from a Japanese Army Coastal Artillery Major(opposite Clayton)  at Futtsu-misaki Point, across Tokyo Bay from Yokosuka Naval Base, 28 August 1945.(USN NH 71599) When word of this circulated LtCmdr Clayton was ordered to give up the sword.  Protocol had it, that only person who could receive the "first" surrendered sword was [[General MacArthur]]. ]]

On 20 August 1945 the [[USS Begor]] embarked UDT 21 at Guam as a component of the U.S. occupation force heading for Japan&lt;ref name= "Begor"/&gt;.  Nine days later UDT 21 became the first U.S military unit to set foot on Japanese home soil when it reconned the beaches at Futtsu-misaki Point in [[Tokyo Bay]]&lt;ref name= "Begor"/&gt;.  The assessment was that the area was well suited for landing U.S amphibious forces.  The next day the Begor took UDT 21 to Yokosuka Naval Base&lt;ref name= "Begor"/&gt;.  There the team cleared the docks for the first U.S. warship to dock in Japan, the [[USS San Diego (CL-53)]]&lt;ref name= "Begor"/&gt;.  The team remained in Tokyo Bay until 8 Sept when it was tasked with locating remaining [[Kamikaze]] and two man submarines at  Katsura Wan, Uchiura Wan at [[Suruga Bay]], [[Sendai]], [[Onohama Shipyards]] and [[Choshi]]&lt;ref name= "Begor"&gt;USS BEGOR (APD-127) veterans webpage[https://www.ussbegor.org/history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Orders arrived for the Begor to return the team to San Diego on 27 September&lt;ref name= "Begor"/&gt;.

==After World War II==
With the draw-down from the war two half-strength UDTs were retained, one on each coast.

'''Operation Crossroads'''
[[Bikini atoll]] was chosen for the site of the  [[nuclear tests]] of [[Operation Crossroads]].  "In March 1946, [[Project Y]] scientists from Los Alamos decided that the analysis of a sample of water from the immediate vicinity of the [[nuclear detonation]] was essential if the tests were to be properly evaluated. After consideration of several proposals to accomplish this, it was finally decided to employ drone boats of the type used by Naval Combat Demolition Units in France during the war"&lt;ref&gt;Operations Crossroads, DNA 6032F, prepared by the Defense Nuclear Agency, p.189-90[http://www.dtra.mil/Portals/61/Documents/NTPR/2-Hist_Rpt_Atm/1946_DNA_6032F.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;.  UDT Easy, later named UDT 3, was given the designation TU 1.1.3 for the Operation and was assigned the control and maintenance of the drone boats.  On 27 April, 7 officers and 51 enlisted embarked the [[USS Begor]] (APD-127) at the Seabee base Port Hueneme, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Operations Crossroads, DNA 6032F, prepared by the Defense Nuclear Agency, p.189-90[http://www.dtra.mil/Portals/61/Documents/NTPR/2-Hist_Rpt_Atm/1946_DNA_6032F.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; for transit to Bikini.  At Bikini the drones were controlled from the Begor.  Once a water sample was taken the drone would return to the Begor to be hosed down for [[decontamination]].  After a [[Radiation Safety Officer]] had taken a [[Geiger counter]] reading and the OK given, the UDTs would board with a radiation chemist to retrieve the sample&lt;ref&gt;USS BEGOR (APD-127) Veterans webpage[https://www.ussbegor.org/history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The USS Begor came to have the reputation as the most contaminated boat in the fleet&lt;ref&gt;USS BEGOR (APD-127) Veterans webpage[https://www.ussbegor.org/history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A huge issue afterwards was the treatment of the dislocated natives.  In November of 1948 the Bikinians were relocated to the uninhabited Island of [[Kili Island|Kili]] however that island was located inside a [[coral reef]] that had no channel for access to the island or the sea&lt;ref name= "KILI"/&gt;.  In the spring of 1949 the  Governor of the [[Trust Territories]], Marshall Group requested the U.S.Navy blast a channel to change this&lt;ref name= "KILI"/&gt;.  That was given to the Seabees on  Kwajalin whose CO quickly determined this was really a UDT project&lt;ref name= "KILI"/&gt;.  He sent a request to CINPACFLT who forwarded it to COMPHIBPAC&lt;ref name= "KILI"/&gt;.  All of this ended up sending UDT 3 back on a truly [[Civic action program]] that turned out better than politicians could have hoped.  The King of the Bikinians held a send off feast for the UDTs the night before they departed&lt;ref name= "KILI"&gt;U. S. Naval Special Warfare Archives, After Operation Crossroads – Kili Island, Mack M. Boynton, December 21,2013, [http://www.navyfrogmen.com/KiliIsland.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submersible Operations''' Even though no combat operations seemed likely, the UDTs continued to research new techniques for underwater and shallow-water operations.  One area was the use of [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] equipment.  Dr. [[Christian J. Lambertsen|Chris Lambertsen]] had developed the [[Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit]] (LARU), an [[oxygen rebreather]], which was used by the Maritime Unit of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]. In October 1943, he demonstrated it to LCDR Kauffman, but was told there was no place in current UDT operations for this radically new device.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite journal |author=Butler FK |title=Closed-circuit oxygen diving in the U.S. Navy |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=3–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15233156 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3986 |accessdate=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blast_32_1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hawkins T |title=OSS Maritime |journal=The Blast |date=1st Quarter 2000 |volume=32 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Dr. Lambertsen and the OSS continued to work on closed-circuit oxygen diving and combat swimming. When the OSS was dissolved in 1945, Lambertsen retained the LARU inventory. He later demonstrated the LARU to Army Engineers, the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], and the UDTs. In 1947, he demonstrated the LARU to LCDR Francis "Doug" Fane, then a senior UDT commander.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubmed15233157&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vann RD |title=Lambertsen and O2: beginnings of operational physiology |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=21–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15233157 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3987 |accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
LCDR Fane was enthusiastic for new diving techniques. He pushed for the adoption of rebreathers and [[Scuba set|SCUBA]] gear for future operations. But the [[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit|Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] and the Navy Dive School (which used the old "hard-hat" diving apparatus) declared it was too dangerous. Nonetheless, Fane invited Dr. Lambertsen to [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek|NAB Little Creek]], [[Virginia]] in January 1948 to demonstrate and train UDT personnel in SCUBA operations. This was the first-ever SCUBA training for Navy divers. Following this training, Fane and Lambertsen demonstrated new UDT capabilities with a successful lock-out and re-entry from {{USS|Grouper|SS-214}}, an underway [[submarine]], to show the Navy's need for this capability. LCDR Fane then started the classified “Submersible Operations” or SUBOPS platoon with men drawn from UDT 2 and 4 under the direction of LTJG Bruce Dunning.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;&lt;ref name=vann&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vann RD |title=The evolution of diving in UDT from WW II through Korea. |journal=Fire-in-the-Hole (Official publication of the UDT-SEAL Museum) |date=Spring 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCDR Fane also brought the conventional "[[Aqua-lung]]" open-circuit SCUBA system into use by the UDTs. Open-circuit SCUBA is less useful to combat divers, as the exhausted air produces a tell-tale trail of bubbles. However, in the early 1950s, the UDTs decided they preferred open-circuit SCUBA, and converted entirely to it. (The remaining stock of LARUs was supposedly destroyed in a beach-party bonfire.) Later on, the UDT reverted to closed-circuit SCUBA, using improved rebreathers developed by Lambertsen.

It was at this time that the UDT (led by Fane) established training facilities at [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDT also began developing weapons skills and procedures for commando operations on land in coastal regions. The UDT started experiments with insertion/extraction by helicopter, jumping from a moving helicopter into the water or rappelling like mountain climbers to the ground. Experimentation developed a system for emergency extraction by plane called "Skyhook." Skyhook utilized a large helium balloon and cable rig with harness. A special grabbing device on the nose of a [[C-130]] enabled a pilot to snatch the cable tethered to the balloon and lift a person off the ground. Once airborne, the crew would winch the cable in and retrieve the personnel though the back of the aircraft. This technique was discontinued for training purposes after the death of a SEAL at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado|NAB Coronado]] on a training lift. The teams still utilize the [[Fulton Skyhook]] for equipment extraction and retain the capability for war if an extreme situation requires it.

== Korean War ==
During the [[Korean War]], the UDTs operated on the coasts of [[North Korea]], with their efforts initially focused on demolitions and mine disposal. Additionally, the UDT accompanied [[South Korea]]n commandos on raids in the North to demolish [[railroad]] tunnels and bridges. The higher-ranking officers of the UDT frowned upon this activity because it was a non-traditional use of the Naval forces, which took them too far from the water line. Due to the nature of the war, the UDT maintained a low operational profile. Some of the better-known missions include the transport of spies into North Korea, and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets.

A more traditional role for the UDT was in support of Operation CHROMITE, the amphibious landing at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]]. UDT 1 and UDT 3 divers went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War &amp;#124; National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |publisher=Navysealmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDT assisted in clearing mines in [[Wonsan]] harbor, under fire from enemy shore batteries. Two minesweepers were sunk in these operations. A UDT diver dove on the wreck of [[USS Pledge (AM-277)|USS ''Pledge'']]: the first U.S. combat operation with SCUBA.

The Korean War was a period of transition for the men of the UDT. They tested their previous limits and defined new parameters for their special style of warfare. These new techniques and expanded horizons positioned the UDT well to assume an even broader role as the storms of war began brewing to the south in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Vietnam War ==
The Navy entered the [[Vietnam War]] in 1958, when the UDTs delivered a small watercraft far up the [[Mekong River]] into [[Laos]]. In 1961, naval advisers started training UDT in [[South Vietnam]]. The men were called the ''Liên Đoàn Người Nhái'' (LDNN), roughly translated as the "soldiers that fight under the sea."

The UDT also carried out [[hydrography|hydrographic]] surveys in South Vietnam's coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-vietnam-the-men-with-green-faces/ |title=SEAL History: Vietnam-The Men With Green Faces &amp;#124; National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |publisher=Navysealmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110042203/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-vietnam-the-men-with-green-faces |archivedate=10 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the UDTs supported the Amphibious Ready Groups operating on South Vietnam's rivers. UDTs manned riverine patrol craft and went ashore to demolish obstacles and enemy bunkers. They operated throughout South Vietnam, from the Mekong Delta (Sea Float), The Parrot Beak and French canal AO's through I Corps and the Song Cui Dai Estuary south of Danang.

== Birth of Navy SEALs ==
In the mid-1950s, the Navy saw how the UDT's mission had expanded to a broad range of "unconventional warfare", but also that this clashed with the UDT's traditional focus on swimming and diving operations. It was therefore decided to create a new type of unit that would build on the UDT's elite qualities and water-borne expertise, but would add land combat skills, including parachute training and guerrilla/counterinsurgency operations.&lt;ref name="Boynton, Mack"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boynton|first=Mack|title=A Founding Father of the Navy SEALs|year=2010|url=http://www.navyfrogmen.com/LCDRMackBoyntonbook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new teams would come to be known as the [[US Navy SEALs]] (which stood for SEa, Air, and Land).  Initially there was a lag in the unit's creation until President [[John F. Kennedy]] took office. Kennedy recognized the need for unconventional warfare, and supported the use of [[special operations]] forces against guerrilla activity. The Navy moved forward to establish its new special operations force and in January 1962 commissioned SEAL Team ONE in NAB Coronado and SEAL Team TWO at NAB Little Creek. UDT-11 &amp; 12 were still active on the west coast and UDT-21 &amp; 22 on the east coast. The SEALs quickly earned a reputation for valor and stealth in Vietnam, where they conducted clandestine raids in perilous territory. In May 1983, the remaining UDT teams were reorganized as SEAL teams. UDT 11 became SEAL Team Five and UDT 12 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team One. UDT 21 became SEAL Team Four and UDT 22 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team Two. A new team, SEAL Team Three was established in October 1983.  Since then, teams of SEALs have taken on shadowy missions in strife-torn regions around the world, stalking high-profile targets such as Panama's Manuel Noriega and Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar and playing integral roles in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Alex|title=A Brief History of:  The Navy SEALs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1891738,00.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=Apr 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those who served in an Underwater Demolition Team, the U.S. Navy authorized the Underwater Demolition operator badge in 1970. However, the UDT badge was phased out in 1971, a few months after it appeared, as was the silver badge for enlisted UDT/SEAL frogmen. After that, SEAL and UDT operators, both officer and enlisted, all wore the same gold Trident, as well as gold Navy jump wings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Warfare_insignia

== Unit awards ==

The UDTs have received several [[unit citation]]s and commendations. Members who participated in actions that merited the award are authorized to wear the medal or ribbon associated with the award on their uniform. [[Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces]] have different categories, i.e. Service, Campaign, Unit, and Personal.  Unit Citations are distinct from the other decorations. &lt;ref&gt;List of Award Abbreviations, Chief of Naval Operations, 2000 Navy Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20350[https://awards.navy.mil/awards/webdoc01.nsf/475F70E6DF9699E486257759004A818E/$File/Award%20Abbreviations.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''zoological specimen''' is an animal or part of an animal preserved for scientific use.
Various uses are: to verify the identity of a ([[species]]), to allow study, increase public knowledge of [[zoology]].
Zoological specimens are extremely diverse. Examples are bird and mammal study skins, [[Taxidermy|mounted specimens]], skeletal material, casts, pinned insects, dried material, animals preserved in liquid preservatives, and microscope slides.
[[List of natural history museums|Natural history museums]] are repositories of zoological specimens

==Study skins==
{{main|Taxidermy}}
[[File:Berlin Naturkundemuseum tote Voegel.jpg|thumb|230px| Study skins of  ''[[Garrulus glandarius]]'' in [[Museum für Naturkunde]], Berlin]]Bird and mammal specimens are conserved as dry [[Taxidermy#Study_skins|study skins]], a form of taxidermy.&lt;ref name="Queensland Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Behind+the+Scenes/Taxidermy#.Wy0dERSnT8s
|title=Taxidermy|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=Queensland Museum Network|publisher=The State Queensland|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is removed from the animal's carcass, treated with absorbents, and filled with cotton or polyester batting (In the past plant fibres or sawdust were used). Bird specimens have a long, thin, wooden dowel wrapped in batting at their center. The dowel is often intentionally longer than the bird's body and exits at the animal's vent. This exposed dowel provides a place to handle the bird without disturbing the feathers. Mammal study skins do not normally utilize wooden dowels, instead preparators use wire to support the legs and tail of mammals. Labels are attached to a leg of the specimen with thread or string. Heat and chemicals are sometimes used to aid the drying of study skins.

==Skeletal Preparations (Osteology)==
[[File:Hog-nosed Skunk Skeleton.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Hog-nosed skunk]] skeleton]]
[[Osteology|Osteological]] collections consist of cleaned, complete and partial skeletons, [[Skull|crania]] of [[Vertebrates]], mainly birds and mammals. They are used in studies of  [[Comparative anatomy|comparative]] anatomy and to identify bones from archaeological sites. Human bones are used in medical and forensic studies.

==Molluscs==
[[File:Museum fg02.jpg|thumb|Dry specimens of Mollusca in [[Museum Wiesbaden]]]]
In museum collections it is common for the dry material to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved in alcohol. The shells minus their soft parts are kept in card trays within drawers or in glass tubes, often as lots (a lot is a collection of a single species taken from a single locality on a single occasion). Shell collections sometimes suffer from [[Byne's disease]] which also affects birds eggs. The study of dry mollusc shells is called [[conchology]] as distinct from [[malacology]] (wet specimens).

==Insects and similar invertebrates==
:''Main articles: [[Insect collecting]]''
[[File:Sceliphron and pest.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A pinned wasp. The dried insect is under attack from pests and this drawer will have to be frozen to contain the problem.]]

Most hard-bodied insect specimens and some other hard-bodied invertebrates such as certain [[Arachnid]]a, are preserved as pinned specimens. Either while still fresh, or after rehydrating them if necessary because they had dried out, specimens are transfixed by special stainless steel [[Entomological equipment for mounting and storage|entomological pins]]. As the insect dries the internal tissues solidify and, possibly aided to some extent by the integument, they grip the pin and secure the specimen in place on the pin. Very small, delicate specimens may instead be secured by fine steel points driven into slips of card, or glued to card points or similar attachments that in turn are pinned in the same way as entire mounted insects. The pins offer a means of handling the specimens without damage, and they also bear labels for descriptive and reference data.

Once dried, the specimens may be kept in conveniently sized open trays. The bottoms of the trays are lined with a material suited to receiving and holding entomological pins securely and conveniently. Cork and foam plastics are convenient examples. However, open trays are very vulnerable to attack by [[Anthrenus museorum|museum beetle]] and similar pests, so such open trays are stored in turn inside glass-topped, insect-proof drawers, commonly protected by suitable [[pesticide]]s or [[insect repellent|repellent]]s or barriers. Alternatively, some museums store the pinned specimens directly in larger trays or drawers that are glass-topped and stored in cabinets.

In contrast to such dried specimens, soft-bodied specimens most commonly are kept in "wet collections", meaning that they are stored in alcohol or similar preservative or [[Fixation (histology)|fixative]] liquids, according to the intended function.

Small specimens, whether hard or soft bodied, and whether entire, [[Dissection|dissected]], or [[Histology#Sectioning|sectioned]], may be stored as [[microscope slide]] preparations.

==Wet specimens==
[[File:Collection1-nat-museum-berlin hg.jpg|thumb|Collection of spiders preserved in alcohol (spirit collection)]]
"Wet" specimen collections are stored in different solutions. A very old method is to store the specimen in 70% [[ethanol]] with various additives after fixing with [[formalin]]&lt;ref&gt;BLUM, J.: Formol als Conservierungsflüssigkeit. Zool. Anz. 16, 1893, Page 450-452&lt;/ref&gt; or in these days sometimes with a salt-solution.&lt;ref&gt;COLEMAN, R. / KOGAN, I.: An improved low-formaldehyde embalming fluid to preserve cadavers for anatomy teaching. J. Anat. 192, 1998, Page 443-446&lt;/ref&gt; Some methods are very useful, because the color can be preserved. (Salt-)Solutions like this are Jores,&lt;ref&gt;JORES, L.: ''Die Conservierung anatomischer Präparate in Blutfarbe mittels Formalin.'' Zbl. Path. Jena 7, 1896, Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiserling&lt;ref&gt;KAISERLING, C.: ''Über die Conservierung von Sammlungspräparaten mit der Erhaltung der natürlichen Farben.'' Klin. Wschr. 33, 1896, Page 725&lt;/ref&gt; and Romhányi.&lt;ref&gt;
ROMÁNHYI, G.: ''Einfaches Verfahren zur Konservierung in natürlichen Farben.'' Virchows Arch. 328, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Modern specimens are stored in [[borosilicate glass]] due to its chemical and thermal resistance and good optical clarity.

==Data==
[[File:SalimAliLabel.jpg|thumb|Label accompanying a bird skin.Note that the locality, date, identity of the specimen and collection catalogue numbers are given on the securely attached label]]
Minimum data associated with zoological specimens is the place and date of collection, attached to the specimen by a label. Additional information is the name of the collector and the habitat. Tissue from specimens may be saved for genetic studies (molecular data, [[DNA]]). Depending on the [[Taxon|animal group]], other data may be included, for instance in bird collections the bird’s breeding condition, weight, colours of its eyes, bills and legs and nature of the stomach contents.

==Composite specimens==
A single specimen may be a composite of preparations sharing a unique number. An example would be a vertebrate with an alcohol-preserved skin and viscera, a cleared and [[Staining|stained]] head, the post-cranial dried skeleton, [[Histology|histological]], glass slides of various organs, and frozen tissue samples. This specimen could also be a voucher for a publication, or photographs and audiotape.

==Voucher specimens==
A voucher is a representative specimen of the animal used in a study, such as a specimen collected as part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] survey or a specimen which was the source of DNA for a molecular study. Voucher specimens confirm the identity of the species referred to in the study. They are a backup against misidentification, changing [[Species problem|species concepts]] which mislead results. [[Holotype|Type]] specimens are a special type of voucher specimen used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].
[[File:Wied fg01.jpg| thumb|180px|Mounted specimen of the [[Black-throated toucanet]] collected by [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied]] and now in [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Naturhistorisches Museum Wien]]]]

==Historic specimens==
Museum zoological specimens may have [[Timeline of zoology|historic significance]]. For example, the specimens collected by [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] and [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] during their Brazil Expedition (1817–1820) are housed in the [[Zoologische Staatssammlung München|Munich Zoology Museum]].

==Models==
Museums make extensive use of models. When these are accurate they are considered to be specimens in their own right. Examples are the glass [[coelenterate]]s of  [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]].
