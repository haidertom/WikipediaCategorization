      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">The '''AB magnitude''' system is an [[Magnitude (astronomy)|astronomical magnitude]] system. Unlike many other magnitude systems, it is based on flux measurements that are calibrated in absolute units, namely [[spectral flux density|spectral flux densities]].

== Definition ==

The ''monochromatic'' AB magnitude is defined as the logarithm of a [[spectral flux density]] with the usual scaling of astronomical magnitudes and a zero-point of about 3631 [[Jansky]],&lt;ref name=refAB83&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oke |first=J. B. |date=1983 |title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=266 |pages=713–717 |bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O |doi=10.1086/160817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where 1 Jansky = 1 Jy = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; W Hz&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;23&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; ("about" because the true definition of the zero point is based on magnitudes as shown below). If the spectral flux density is denoted ''f&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'', the monochromatic AB magnitude is:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{3631\text{ Jy}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{f_{\nu}}{\text{Jy}}\right) + 8.90.&lt;/math&gt;

This exact definition is defined in magnitudes relative to the [[cgs]] units of erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} = -2.5 \log_{10} f_{\nu} - 48.60.&lt;/math&gt;

Inverting this leads to the true definition of the numerical value "3631 Jy" often cited:

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\nu,0} =  10^{\frac{48.60}{-2.5}} \approx 3631 \times 10^{-23}&lt;/math&gt;



Actual measurements are always made across some continuous range of wavelengths. The ''bandpass'' AB magnitude is defined so that the zero point corresponds to a bandpass-averaged spectral flux density of about 3631 [[Jansky]]:

:&lt;math&gt;m_\text{AB} \approx  -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{\int f_\nu (h\nu)^{-1} e(\nu) d\nu}{\int 3631\text{ Jy} (h\nu)^{-1} e(\nu) d\nu}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e(ν)'' is the "equal-energy" filter response function and the ''(hν)''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; term assumes that the detector is a photon-counting device such as a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[photomultiplier]].&lt;ref name=refPS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tonry |first=J. L. |date=2012 |title=The Pan-STARRS1 Photometric System |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=750 |pages=99 |bibcode=2012ApJ...750...99T
 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/99 |arxiv = 1203.0297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Filter responses are sometimes expressed as quantum efficiencies, that is, in terms of their response per photon, rather than per unit energy. In those cases the ''(hν)''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; term has been folded into the definition of e(ν) and should not be included.)

The STMAG system is similarly defined, but for constant flux per unit wavelength interval instead.

AB stands for "absolute" in the sense that no relative reference object is used (unlike using [[Vega#Observation history|Vega]] as a baseline object).&lt;ref name=refAB74&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oke |first=J. B. |date=1974 |title=Absolute spectral energy distributions for white dwarfs |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=236 |issue=27|pages=21–25 |bibcode=
1974ApJS...27...21O |doi = 10.1086/190287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This must not be confused with [[absolute magnitude]] in the sense of the apparent brightness of an object if seen from a distance of 10pc.

== Expression in terms of f&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ==

In some fields, [[spectral flux density|spectral flux densities]] are expressed per unit wavelength, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than per unit frequency, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;. At any specific wavelength,

:&lt;math&gt;f_\nu = \frac{\lambda^2}{c} f_\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; is measured per frequency (e.g., Hertz), and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is measured per wavelength (e.g., cm). If the wavelength unit is [[Ångstrom]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f_\nu}{\text{Jy}} = 3.34 \times 10^4 \left(\frac{\lambda}{\AA}\right)^2 \frac{f_\lambda}{\text{erg} \text{ cm}^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1} \AA^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can then be plugged into the equations above.

The “pivot wavelength” of a given bandpass is the value of λ that makes the above conversion exact for observations made in that bandpass. For an equal-energy response function as defined above, it is &lt;ref name=TV05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokunaga|first=A. T.|author2=Vacca|title=The Mauna Kea Observatories Near‐Infrared Filter Set. III. Isophotal Wavelengths and Absolute Calibration|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2005PASP..117..421T&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= |date=April 2005|volume=117|issue=830|pages=421–426|doi=10.1086/429382|accessdate=25 February 2014|arxiv = astro-ph/0502120 |bibcode = 2005PASP..117..421T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{piv} = \sqrt{\frac{\int e(\lambda) d\lambda}{\int e(\lambda) \lambda^{-2} d\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;.

For a response function expressed in the quantum-efficiency convention, it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{piv} = \sqrt{\frac{\int e(\lambda) \lambda d\lambda}{\int e(\lambda) \lambda^{-1} d\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Conversion from other magnitude systems ==

Magnitudes in the AB system can be converted to other systems. However, because all magnitude systems involve integration of some assumed source spectrum over some assumed passband, such conversions are not necessarily trivial to calculate, and precise conversions depend on the actual spectrum of the source in question. Various authors have computed conversions for standard situations.&lt;ref name=refBR07&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanton |first=M. R. |date=2007 |title=K-Corrections and Filter Transformations in the Ultraviolet, Optical, and Near-Infrared |journal=[[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume=133 |issue=2|pages=734–754 |bibcode=2007AJ....133..734B |doi=10.1086/510127 |arxiv = astro-ph/0606170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22675">In [[psychology]], '''anomalistic psychology''' is the study of human behaviour and experience connected with what is often called the [[paranormal]], with the assumption that there is nothing paranormal involved.

==Early history==
[[File:Henry Maudsley.jpg|thumb|180x180px|left|[[Henry Maudsley]] (1835–1918) an early researcher in anomalistic psychology.]]
According to anomalistic psychology, paranormal phenomena have naturalistic explanations resulting from [[psychological]] and [[Physics|physical]] factors which have given the false impression of paranormal activity to some people.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Holt, Christine Simmonds-Moore, David Luke, [[Chris French|Christopher French]]. (2012). ''Anomalistic Psychology (Palgrave Insights in Psychology)''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0230301504}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many early publications that gave rational explanations for alleged [[paranormal]] experiences.

The physician [[John Ferriar]] wrote ''An Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitions'' in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of [[ghosts]] were the result of [[optical illusions]]. Later, the French physician [[Alexandre Jacques François Brière de Boismont]] published ''On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism'' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of [[hallucinations]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane McCorristine. (2010). ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England, 1750–1920''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 44–56. {{ISBN|978-0521747967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Benjamin Carpenter]], in his book ''Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Etc: Historically and Scientifically Considered'' (1877), wrote that Spiritualist practices could be explained by fraud, delusion, [[hypnotism]] and [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benjamin Carpenter]]. (1877). ''Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Etc: Historically and Scientifically Considered''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1108027397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]], in ''Natural Causes and Supernatural Seemings'' (1886), wrote that so-called [[supernatural]] experiences could be explained in terms of disorders of the mind and were simply "malobservations and misinterpretations of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Leudar, Philip Thomas. (2000). ''Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity: Studies of Verbal Hallucinations''. Routledge. pp. 106–107. {{ISBN|978-0415147873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the German psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] and psychiatrist [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]] formed the "critical occultism" position. This viewpoint interpreted psychical phenomena naturalistically. All apparent cases were attributed to fraud, [[suggestion]], [[Unconscious communication|unconscious cues]] or psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Wolffram, Heather. (2009). ''The Stepchildren of Science: Psychical Research and Parapsychology in Germany, C. 1870-1939''. Rodopi. pp. 83-130. {{ISBN|978-90-420-2728-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moll wrote that practices such as [[Christian Science]], Spiritualism and [[occultism]] were the result of fraud and hypnotic suggestion. Moll argued that suggestion explained the cures of Christian Science, as well as the apparently supernatural rapport between [[Animal magnetism|magnetisers]] and their somnambulists. He wrote that fraud and [[hypnotism]] could explain mediumistic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wolffram, Heather. (2012). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381525/ ''‘Trick’, ‘Manipulation’ and ‘Farce’: Albert Moll’s Critique of Occultism'']. Medical History 56(2): 277–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lionel Weatherly (a psychiatrist) and [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] (a magician) wrote ''The Supernatural?'' (1891) which offered rational explanations for [[Apparitional experience|apparition]]s, paranormal and [[religious experience]]s and Spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Weatherly, [[John Nevil Maskelyne]]. (2011). ''The Supernatural? (Cambridge Library Collection – Spiritualism and Esoteric Knowledge)''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1108029193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Jaspers]], in his book ''General Psychopathology'' (1913), stated that all paranormal phenomena are manifestations of psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Jaspers]]. (1913). ''General Psychopathology''. Baltimore. MD: Johns Hopkins. {{ISBN|978-0801858154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German ''Zeitschrift für Kritischen Okkultismus'' (Journal for Critical Occultism) operated from 1926-1928.&lt;ref name="Kurtz 1985"&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 487. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Richard Baerwald]] was the editor, and the journal published articles by Dessoir, Moll and others. It contained "some of the most important skeptical investigations of claims of the paranormal".&lt;ref name="Kurtz 1985"/&gt;

Other early scientists who studied anomalistic psychology include [[Millais Culpin]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] and [[Ivor Lloyd Tuckett]].

==Modern research==

The phrase "Anomalistic Psychology" was a term first suggested by the psychologists [[Leonard Zusne]] and Warren Jones in their book ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking'' (1989) which systematically addresses phenomena of human consciousness and behaviors that may appear to violate the laws of nature when they actually do not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Zusne]], Warren H. Jones. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-0805805086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian psychologist [[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]] published a major work on the subject ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Graham Reed]]. (1972). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience: A Cognitive Approach''. Hutchinson University Library. {{ISBN|978-0091132408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychological publications have explained in detail how reported paranormal phenomena such as [[mediumship]], [[precognition]], [[out-of-body experience]]s and [[psychic]]s can be explained by psychological factors without recourse to the supernatural. Researchers involved with anomalistic psychology try to provide plausible non-paranormal accounts, supported by empirical evidence, of how psychological and physical factors might combine to give the impression of paranormal activity when there had been none. Apart from deception or self-deception such explanations might involve [[cognitive bias]]es, anomalous psychological states, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative state]]s, hallucinations, personality factors, developmental issues and the nature of memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/apru/what/ What is Anomalistic Psychology?]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Chris French World Skeptics Congress Berlin 2012.jpg|thumb|220x220px|right|[[Chris French]] founder of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.]]

The psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] wrote that paranormal phenomena can be explained by [[magical thinking]], [[mental image]]ry, [[subjective validation]], [[coincidence]], hidden causes, and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David. (1988). ''The psychology of paranormal beliefs''. Experientia, 44, 332–337.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] wrote that many paranormal phenomena can be explained via psychological effects such as [[hallucination]]s, [[sleep paralysis]] and hidden memories, a phenomenon in which experiences that originally make little conscious impression are filed away in the brain to be suddenly remembered later in an altered form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|978-1573920940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massimo Polidoro]], a professor of Anomalistic Psychology at the [[University of Milano Bicocca]], Italy, taught the course "Scientific Method, Pseudoscience and Anomalistic Psychology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massimopolidoro.com/english-version/bio-notes Biography of Massimo Polidoro]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable researcher is the British psychologist [[Chris French]] who set up the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit (APRU) in the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/weird-science/200909/anomalistic-psychology-what-is-it-and-why-bother Anomalistic psychology: What is it and why bother? by Chris French]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hauntings===

A psychological study (Klemperer, 1992) of [[ghost]]s wrote that visions of ghosts may arise from [[Hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] hallucinations ("waking dreams" which are experienced in the transitional states to and from [[sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;Klemperer, Frances. (1992). [http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC1884722/pdf/bmj00105-0010.pdf ''Ghosts, Visions, And Voices: Sometimes Simply Perceptual Mistakes]''. BMJ: British Medical Journal, Vol. 305, No. 6868 (Dec. 19–26), pp. 1518–1519.&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment (Lange and Houran, 1997) 22 subjects visited five areas of a performance [[theatre]] and were asked to take note of the environment. Half of the subjects were informed that the locations they were in were [[Haunted house|haunted]], whilst the other half were told that the building was simply under [[renovation]]. The subjects' perceptions in both groups were recorded to an experiential questionnaire which contained 10 subscales related to psychological and physiological perceptions. The results showed more intense perceptual experiences on nine of the ten subscales from the group that was told the building was haunted, which has indicated that [[demand characteristics]] alone can stimulate paranormal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, R., and J. Houran. (1997). ''Context-induced paranormal experiences: Support for Houran and Lange's model of haunting phenomena''. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 84, 1455–1458.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study (Lange and Houran, 1998) suggested that [[poltergeist]] experiences are [[delusion]]s "resulting from the affective and cognitive dynamics of percipients' interpretation of ambiguous stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;Lange, R., Houran, J. (1998). ''Delusions of the paranormal: A haunting question of perception''. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 186 (10), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two experiments into alleged [[hauntings]] (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003) discovered that the data supported the "notion that people consistently report unusual experiences in ‘haunted’ areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations." Some of these factors included "the variance of local magnetic fields, size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware".&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R., C. Watt, P. Stevens, et al. (2003). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/BJP-hauntings.pdf ''An investigation into alleged “hauntings”'']. British Journal of Psychology, 94: 195–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediumship===

Research and empirical evidence from psychology for over a hundred years has revealed that where there is not fraud, [[mediumship]] and [[Spiritualism|Spiritualistic]] practices can be explained by psychological factors. Trance mediumship, which is claimed by the Spiritualists to be caused by discarnate [[spirit]]s speaking through the medium, has been proven in some cases to be the emergence of [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]] from the medium's [[Subconscious|subconscious mind]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Millais Culpin]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism and the New Psychology, an Explanation of Spiritualist Phenomena and Beliefs in Terms of Modern Knowledge''. Kennelly Press. {{ISBN|978-1446056516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium may obtain information about their clients, called sitters, by secretly [[eavesdropping]] on sitter's conversations or searching telephone directories, the [[internet]] and [[newspaper]]s before the sittings.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rowland. (1998). ''The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading''. London, England: Ian Roland. {{ISBN|978-0955847608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mediums are known for employing a technique called [[cold reading]] which involves obtaining information from the sitter's [[behavior]], [[clothing]], [[Human positions|posture]], and [[jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;Brad Clark (2002). ''Spiritualism''. pp. 220–226 in Michael Shermer. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1576076538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Smith. (2009). ''Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit''. Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 141–241. {{ISBN|978-1405181228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of fake [[Séance|seance]] experiments (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003), an actor [[Suggestion|suggested]] to [[paranormal]] believers and disbelievers that a table was [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] when, in fact, it remained stationary. After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake seances contained genuine paranormal phenomena. The experiments strongly supported the notion that in the seance room, believers are more suggestible than disbelievers to suggestions that are consistent with their belief in paranormal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R., Greening, E., and Smith, M. (2003). [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2299/2278/1/103252.pdf ''Belief in the paranormal and suggestion in the seance room'']. British Journal of Psychology, 94 (3): 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment (O'Keeffe and Wiseman, 2005) involving 5 mediums found no evidence to support the notion that the mediums under controlled conditions were able to demonstrate paranormal or mediumistic ability.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keeffe, C. &amp; Wiseman, R. (2005). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/MediumBJP.pdf ''Testing alleged mediumship: Methods and results'']. British Journal of Psychology, Vol. 96, 165–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paranormal healing===

A study in the [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]] (Rose, 1954) investigated [[Energy medicine|spiritual healing]], [[therapeutic touch]] and [[faith healing]]. In a hundred cases that were investigated no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rose. (1954). ''Some Aspects Of Paranormal Healing''. British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 4900, pp. 1329–1332.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial was carried out by a group of scientists (Beutler, 1988) to see whether three treatment groups, paranormal [[laying on of hands]], paranormal healing at a distance and no paranormal healing to test if they might reduce [[blood pressure]]. The data did not reveal any paranormal effects as no significant differences between the three treatment groups were found. The results concluded that the fall in blood pressure in all three of the groups was caused by the [[psychosocial]] approach and the [[placebo effect]] of the trial itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beutler, J., Attevelt, J., Schouten, S., Faber, J., Mees, E., &amp; Geijskes, G. (1988). ''Paranormal healing and hypertension''. British Medical Journal, 296, 1491–1494.&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of paranormal healing known as [[psychic surgery]] has been discovered to be the result of [[sleight of hand]] tricks. Psychic surgeons pretend to reach into the patient's body but the [[skin]] is never punctured, there are no scars and the [[blood]] is released from packets hidden in the surgeon's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Moore. (1992). ''Debunking the Paranormal: We Should Teach Critical Thinking as a Necessity for Living, Not Just as a Tool for Science''. The American Biology Teacher, Vol. 54, No. 1, pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychokinesis===

[[Cognitive bias]]es have been found in some cases of [[psychokinesis]]. A meta-analysis  by Bösch, ''et al'' (2006) of 380 studies found that "statistical significance of the overall database provides no directive as to whether the phenomenon is genuine or not" and came to the conclusion that "publication bias appears to be the easiest and most encompassing explanation for the primary findings of the meta-analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Bösch, H., Steinkamp, F., Boller, E. (2006). [http://www.ebo.de/publikationen/pk_ma.pdf ''Examining Psychokinesis: The Interaction of Human Intention with Random Number Generators. A Meta-Analysis Examining Psychokinesis: The Interaction of Human Intention with. Random Number Generators. A Meta-Analysis'']. Psychological Bulletin, 132 (4): 497–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Wiseman]] there are a number of ways for faking psychokinetic metal bending (PKMB) these include switching straight objects for pre-bent duplicates, the concealed application of force, and secretly inducing metallic fractures. Research has also suggested that (PKMB) effects can be created by [[Suggestion|verbal suggestion]]. On this subject (Harris, 1985) wrote:

{{cquote|If you are doing a really convincing job, then you should be able to put a bent key on the table and comment, ‘Look, it is still bending’, and have your spectators really believe that it is. This may sound the height of boldness; however, the effect is astounding – and combined with suggestion, it does work.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Harris. (1985). ''Gellerism Revealed: The Psychology and Methodology Behind the Geller Effect''. Calgary: Micky Hades International. {{ISBN|978-0919230927}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an experimental study (Wiseman and Greening, 2005) two groups of participants were shown a [[videotape]] in which a fake psychic placed a bent [[key (lock)|key]] on a table. Participants in the first group heard the fake psychic suggest that the key was continuing to bend when it had remained stationary, whilst those in the second group did not. The results revealed that participants from the first group reported significantly more movement of the key than the second group. The findings were replicated in another study. The experiments had demonstrated that "testimony for PKMB after effects can be created by verbal suggestion, and therefore the testimony from individuals who have observed allegedly genuine demonstrations of such effects should not be seen as strong evidence in support of the paranormal".&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, R. &amp; Greening, E. (2005). [http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/BJP-key.pdf ''It's still bending': verbal suggestion and alleged psychokinetic ability'']. British Journal of Psychology, 96, 115–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote viewing===
Research has suggested that in cases the participants of [[remote viewing]] experiments are influenced by [[subjective validation]], a process through which correspondences are perceived between stimuli that are in fact associated purely randomly. [[Sensory cue]]s have also occurred in remote viewing experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David. (1981). ''Sensory cues invalidate remote viewing experiments''. Nature 292: 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telepathy===
Research has discovered that in some cases [[telepathy]] can be explained by a [[Covariance|covariation bias]]. In an experiment (Schienle ''et al''. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Schienle, A., Vaitl, D., and Stark, R. (1996). ''Covariation bias and paranormal belief''. Psychological Reports, 78, 291–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by [[Hindsight bias|hindsight]] and [[Confirmation bias|confirmation]] biases.&lt;ref&gt;Rudski, J. M. (2002). ''Hindsight and confirmation biases in an exercise in telepathy''. Psychological Reports, 91, 899–906.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with parapsychology==

Anomalistic psychology is sometimes described as a sub-field of [[parapsychology]], however, anomalistic psychology rejects the paranormal claims of parapsychology. According to [[Chris French]]:

{{cquote|The difference between anomalistic psychology and parapsychology is in terms of the aims of what each discipline is about. Parapsychologists typically are actually searching for evidence to prove the reality of paranormal forces, to prove they really do exist. So the starting assumption is that paranormal things do happen, whereas anomalistic psychologists tend to start from the position that paranormal forces probably don't exist and that therefore we should be looking for other kinds of explanations, in particular the psychological explanations for those experiences that people typically label as paranormal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videojug.com/interview/anomalistic-psychology-2 Interview with Chris French on Anomalistic psychology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520125500/http://www.videojug.com/interview/anomalistic-psychology-2 |date=May 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anomalistic psychology has been reported to be on the rise. It is now offered as an option on many psychology degree programmes and is also an option on the A2 psychology syllabus in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/12/19/the-rise-of-anomalistic-psychology-%E2%80%93-and-the-fall-of-parapsychology The rise of anomalistic psychology – and the fall of parapsychology?]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Archigram''' was an [[avant-garde]] architectural group formed in the 1960s - based at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]], [[London]] - that was [[neofuturistic]], anti-heroic and  pro-consumerist, drawing inspiration from technology in order to create a new reality that was solely expressed through hypothetical projects. The main members of the group were [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], [[Warren Chalk]], [[Ron Herron]], [[Dennis Crompton]], [[Michael Webb (architect)|Michael Webb]] and [[David Greene (architect)|David Greene]]. Designer [[Theo Crosby]] was the "hidden hand" behind the group.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sadler, ''Archigram: architecture without architecture'', MIT Press, 2005, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; He gave them coverage in ''Architectural Design'' magazine (where he was an editor from 1953–62), brought them to the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, where, in 1963, they mounted an exhibition called ''Living Cities'',&lt;ref&gt;Crosby raised the money for this from the Gulbenkian Foundation, and subsequently edited its publication in the ICA's ''Living Arts'' magazine: Sadler, ''op cit'', p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 brought them into the Taylor Woodrow Design Group, which he headed, to take on experimental projects.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cook, ''Archigram'', Princeton Architectural Press, 1999, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet ''Archigram I'' was printed in 1961 to proclaim their ideas. Committed to a 'high tech', light weight, infra-structural approach that was focused towards survival technology, the group experimented with modular technology, mobility through the environment, space capsules and mass-consumer imagery. Their works offered a seductive vision of a glamorous future machine age; however, social and environmental issues were left unaddressed. 

Archigram agitated to prevent modernism from becoming a sterile and safe orthodoxy by its adherents. Unlike ephemeralisation from [[Buckminster Fuller]] which assumes more must be done with less material (because material is finite), Archigram relies on a future of interminable resources.

The works of Archigram had a [[neofuturistic]] slant being influenced by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]'s works. [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Yona Friedman]] were also important sources of inspiration. The works of Archigram served as a source of inspiration for later works such as the [[High-tech architecture|High tech]] '[[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou centre]]' 1971 by  [[Richard Rogers]] and [[Renzo Piano]], early Norman Foster works, [[Gianfranco Franchini]] and [[Future Systems]]. By the early 1970s the strategy of the group had changed. In 1973 Theo Crosby wrote&lt;ref&gt;in ''How to play the environment game'', Penguin, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; that its members had "found their original impulses towards megastructures blunted by the changing intellectual climate in England, where the brash dreams of modern architects are received with ever-increasing horror. They are now more concerned with the infiltration of technology into the environment at a much less obvious level".

{{Cquote|If we consider for a moment [[Christo]]'s seminal work – the 'wrapped cliff' – we might see it in one of two ways: as a wrapped cliff or; preferably, as the point at which all other cliffs are unwrapped. An Archigram project attempts to achieve this same altered reading of the familiar (in the tradition of Buckminster Fuller's question, 'How much does your building weigh?'). It provides a new agenda where nomadism is the dominant social force; where time, exchange and metamorphosis replace stasis; where consumption, lifestyle and transience become the programme; and where the public realm is an electronic surface enclosing the globe —David Greene&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, Dennis (ed.) (1999). ''Concerning Archigram...'' London: Archigram Archives; prologue&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The group was financially supported by mainstream architects, such as [[David Rock (architect)|David Rock]] of [[Building Design Partnership|BDP]]. Rock later nominated Archigram for the [[RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] which they received in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm ''ARCHIGRAM - RIBA Royal Gold Medalists 2002''] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOX8Oikq?url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/people/showcase/01-02/archigram.htm |date=31 December 2010 }} Citation by '''David Rock''' retrieved 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sixpack France]] dedicated their Summer Spring 2009 Collection to this movement.

==Projects==
===Plug-in-City, Peter Cook, 1964===

Plug-in-City is a mega-structure with no buildings, just a massive framework into which dwellings in the form of cells or standardised components could be slotted. The machine had taken over and people were the raw material being processed, the difference being that people are meant to enjoy the experience.

===The Walking City, Ron Herron, 1964===

The [[Walking city|Walking City]] is constituted by intelligent buildings or robots that are in the form of giant, self-contained living pods that could roam the cities. The form derived from a combination of insect and machine and was a literal interpretation of le-Corbusier's aphorism of a house as a machine for living in. The pods were independent, yet parasitic as they could 'plug into' way stations to exchange occupants or replenish resources. The citizen is therefore a serviced nomad not totally dissimilar from today's executive cars. The context was perceived as a future ruined world in the aftermath of a nuclear war.

===Instant City ===

Instant City is a mobile technological event that drifts into underdeveloped, drab towns via air (balloons) with provisional structures (performance spaces) in tow. The effect is a deliberate overstimulation to produce mass culture, with an embrace of advertising aesthetics. The whole endeavor is intended to eventually move on leaving behind advanced technology hook-ups.

===Other projects===

Tuned City, in which Archigram's infrastructural and spatial additions attach themselves to an existing town at a percentage that leaves evidence of the previous development, rather than subsuming the whole.

'''Audio noise measurement''' is carried out to assess the quality of [[audio equipment]], such as is used in [[recording studio]]s, [[broadcast engineering]], and in-home [[high fidelity]].

In general, [[noise]] refers to unwanted [[sound]], but in audio systems it is the low-level hiss or buzz that intrudes on quiet passages that is of most interest. All recordings will contain some background noise that was picked up by microphones, such as the rumble of air conditioning, or the shuffling of an audience, but in addition to this, every piece of equipment which the recorded signal subsequently passes through will add a certain amount of electronic noise, which ideally should be so low as possible to contribute insignificantly to what is heard.

== Origins of noise - the need for Weighting ==
[[Microphones]], amplifiers and recording systems all add some [[electronic noise]] to the signals passing through them, generally described as hum, buzz or hiss. All buildings have low-level magnetic and electrostatic fields in and around them emanating from [[mains supply]] wiring, and these can induce hum into signal paths, typically 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (depending on the country's electrical supply standard) and lower harmonics. Shielded cables help to prevent this, and on professional equipment where longer interconnections are common, balanced signal connections (most often with [[XLR connector|XLR]] or [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]) are usually employed. Hiss is the result of random signals, often arising from the random motion of electrons in transistors and other electronic components, or the random distribution of oxide particles on analog magnetic tape. It is predominantly heard at high frequencies, sounding like steam or compressed air.

Attempts to measure noise in audio equipment as RMS voltage, using a simple level meter or voltmeter, do not produce useful results; a special noise-measuring instrument is required. This is because noise contains energy spread over a wide range of frequencies and levels, and different sources of noise have different spectral content. For measurements to allow fair comparison of different systems they must be made using a measuring instrument that responds in a way that corresponds to how we hear sounds. From this, three requirements follow. Firstly, it is important that frequencies above or below those that can be heard by even the best ears are filtered out and ignored by bandwidth limiting (usually 22&amp;nbsp;Hz to 22&amp;nbsp;kHz). Secondly, the measuring instrument should give varying emphasis to different frequency components of the noise in the same way that our ears do, a process referred to as ‘weighting’. Thirdly, the rectifier or detector that is used to convert the varying alternating noise signal into a steady positive representation of level should take time to respond fully to brief peaks to the same extent that our ears do; it should have the correct ‘dynamics’.

The proper measurement of noise therefore requires the use of a specified method, with defined measurement bandwidth and weighting curve, and rectifier dynamics. The two main methods defined by current standards are '''A-weighting''' and '''ITU-R 468'''(formerly known as '''CCIR weighting''').

== A-weighting ==

[[A-weighting]] uses a weighting curve based on ‘[[equal-loudness contours]]’ that describe our hearing sensitivity to pure tones, but it turns out that the assumption that such contours would be valid for noise components was wrong.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} While the A-weighting curve peaks by about 2dB around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, it turns out that our sensitivity to noise peaks by some 12dB at 6&amp;nbsp;kHz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Another weakness of A-weighting is that it is usually combined with an rms (root mean square) rectifier, which measures mean power, with no attempt made to account for proper hearing dynamics.{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}

== ITU-R 468 weighting ==
[[Image:Lindos3.svg|400px|right]]

When measurements started to be used in reviews of consumer equipment in the late 1960s it became apparent that they did not always correlate with what was heard. In particular, the introduction of Dolby B noise-reduction on cassette recorders was found to make them sound a full 10dB less noisy, yet they did not measure 10dB better. Various new methods were then devised, including one which used a harsher weighting filter and a quasi-peak rectifier, defined as part of the German DIN45 500 ‘Hi Fi’ standard. This standard, no longer in use, attempted to lay down minimum performance requirements in all areas for ‘High Fidelity’ reproduction.

The introduction of [[FM radio]], which also generates predominantly high-frequency hiss, also showed up the unsatisfactory nature of A-weighting, and the [[BBC Research Department]] undertook a research project to determine which of several weighting filter and rectifier characteristics gave results that were most in line with the judgment of panel of listeners, using a wide variety of different types of noise. BBC Research Department Report EL-17 formed the basis of what became known as CCIR recommendation 468, which specified both a new weighting curve and a [[quasi-peak]] rectifier. This became the standard of choice for broadcasters worldwide, and it was also adopted by [[Dolby]], for measurements on its noise-reduction systems which were rapidly becoming the standard in cinema sound, as well as in recording studios and the home.

Though they represent what we truly hear, [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] gives figures that are typically some 11dB worse than A-weighted, a fact that brought resistance from marketing departments{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}{{Dubious|date=April 2010}} reluctant to put worse specifications on their equipment than the public had been used to. Dolby tried to get round this by introducing a version of their own called CCIR-Dolby which incorporated a 6dB shift into the result (and a cheaper average reading rectifier), but this only confused matters, and was very much disapproved of by the CCIR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the demise of the CCIR, the 468 standard is now maintained as [[Standard:ITU-R 468|ITU-R 468]], by the International Telecommunications Union, and forms part of many national and international standards, in particular by the IEC (International Electrotechnical commission), and the BSI (British Standards Institute). It is the only way to measure noise, that allows fair comparisons; and yet the flawed A-weighting has made a comeback in the consumer field recently, for the simple reason that it gives the lower figures that are considered more impressive by marketing departments.{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}

== Signal to noise ratio and Dynamic range ==

Audio equipment specifications tend to include the terms ‘[[signal to noise ratio]]’ and ‘[[dynamic range]]’, both of which have multiple definitions, sometimes treated as synonyms.  The exact meaning must be specified along with the measurement.

=== Analog ===

Dynamic range used to mean{{Specify|date=May 2010}} the difference between maximum level and noise level, with maximum level defined as a clipping signal with a specified THD+N.  The term has become corrupted by a tendency{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} to refer to the dynamic range of CD players as meaning the noise level on a blank recording with no dither, (in other words, just the analog noise content at the output). This is not particularly useful; especially since many CD players incorporate automatic muting in the absence of signal.

Since the early 1990s various writers such as Julian Dunn have suggested that dynamic range be measured in the presence of a low-level test signal. Thus, any spurious signals caused by the test signal or distortion will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5330A-31A_F5.pdf |title=8-Pin, Stereo A/D Converter for Digital Audio |publisher=[[Cirrus Logic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119140453/http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5330A-31A_F5.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-19}} "Dynamic range is a signal-to-noise measurement over the specified bandwidth made with a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is then added to the resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full scale. This technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the measurement."&lt;/ref&gt; This also addresses concerns about muting circuits.

=== Digital ===

In 1999, Dr. Steven Harris &amp; Clif Sanchez Cirrus Logic published a white paper titled "Personal Computer Audio Quality Measurements" stating:

{{quote|Dynamic Range is the ratio of the full scale signal level to the RMS noise floor{{definition|what is the RMS noise floor in a digital signal?|date=November 2010}}, in the presence of signal, expressed in dB FS. This specification is given as an absolute number and is sometimes referred to as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the presence of a signal. The label SNR should not be used due to industry confusion over the exact definition. DR can be measured using the THD+N measurement with a -60 dB FS signal. This low amplitude is small enough to minimize any large signal non-linearity, but large enough to ensure that the system under test is being exercised. Other test signal amplitudes may be used, provided that the signal level is such that no distortion components are generated.}}

In 2000 the AES released AES Information Document 6id-2000 which defined dynamic range as "20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the full-scale signal to the r.m.s. noise floor in the presence of signal, expressed in dB FS" with the following note:

{{quote|This specification is sometimes referred to as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of a signal. The label SNR should not be used due to industry confusion over the exact definition. SNR is often used to indicate signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise level being measured with no signal. This can often give an optimistic result because of muting circuits, which mute the noise when no signal is present.}}

A '''bad quarto''', in Shakespearean scholarship, is a [[book size|quarto-sized]] publication of one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays that is considered spurious, [[pirated]] from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors, which, according to a theory, has been termed "[[memorial reconstruction]]". Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Harold. "Introduction". Shakespeare, William.  ''Hamlet''. Arden Shakespeare (1982) {{ISBN|1-903436-67-2}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to a "good quarto", which is considered to be a text that is authorised, one that may have been printed from the author's manuscript, or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author's manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad quartos" are considered to include the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Henry V'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"/&gt;

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'', [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene's]] ''Orlando Furioso'', and the collaborative script, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas.

"The Case for the Folio"]. (2007) Playshakespeare.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of bad quarto theory==
The concept of the "bad quarto" as a category of text was created by bibliographer [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in his book ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos'' (1909).  The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, "To the Great Variety of Readers". Heminges and Condell refer to "diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies" of the plays. It had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays.

Pollard, however, claims that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to "bad" quartos, and Pollard lists as "bad" the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1597), ''Henry V'' (1600), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (1602), ''Hamlet'' (1603), and ''Pericles'' (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained "badness" but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays.&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Margreta. "The essential Shakespeare and the material book." Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. ''Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition''. Courier Corporation (1999) {{ISBN|9780815329671}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[W. W. Greg]] worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'',&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. editor. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001373658 ''Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor''], 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; which is a work that is significant in the history of the "bad quarto" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of "Host" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used "[[memorial reconstruction]]", a phrase later used by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Alfred W. ''Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays'', 1594–1685. University of Michigan Library (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas. ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}}. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet]]

For Shakespeare, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented [[shorthand]] reporting, a practice mentioned by [[Thomas Heywood]] in the Prologue to his 1605 play ''If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody''; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. Greg and R. C. Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had [[memorial reconstruction|reconstructed the play texts from memory]] and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.

The idea caught on among Shakespeare scholars. Peter Alexander added ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (1594) and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (1595), the earliest versions of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' to the roster of bad quartos; they had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same stories. The concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century, the idea was widely being used.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Criticism and alternative hypotheses==
Some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis. The first quarto of [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] is considered a bad quarto "even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained. He maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were "partial" memorial reconstructions.

Some critics, including [[Eric Sams]] and [[Hardin Craig]], dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision. Steven Urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that ''[[King Lear]]'' is a revised work in ''Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear"''. Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, like ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised.

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis for ''The Taming of a Shrew'', the alternative version of Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]].''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 6–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burkhart's 1975 study ''Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast'' provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have questioned the "orthodox view" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

==Maguire study==
In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the [[BBC TV]] Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 17 March 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of other playwrights==
Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the [[English Renaissance]] era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published "A Census of Bad Quartos" and included 20 play texts.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''[[Fair Em]]'', plays of the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], plus [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Blind Beggar of Alexandria]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', ''Part 1'' of Heywood's ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 227–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
One of the Barcelona GSE's main objectives is to make Barcelona a worldwide primary reference in economic research.

===Research Rankings===
The GSE community constitutes one of the leading clusters of economics research in Europe. Three studies in the ''Journal of the European Economic Association'' placed it near the top of its rankings. According to P. Kalaitzidakis, T.P. Mamuneas, and T. Stengos “Ranking of Academic Journals and Institutions in Economics” (May 2002), it should be ranked 2nd, when their top 30 journals are taken into account (period 1995-1999). In another study by M. Lubrano, L. Bauwens, A. Kirman and C. Protopopescu, “Ranking Economics Departments in Europe: A Statistical Approach” (May 2003), the GSE community should be ranked #3 when their top journal list is considered (period 1991-2000). And according to J. Drèze and F. Estevan “Research and Higher Education in Economics: Can We Deliver The Lisbon Objectives?” (May 2007) the Barcelona GSE’s total research output would rank between second and third in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Research and Higher Education in Economics: Can We Deliver The Lisbon Objectives? | doi=10.1162/jeea.2007.5.2-3.271 | volume=5 | issue=2–3 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=271–304|year = 2007|last1 = Drèze|first1 = Jacques H.| last2=Estevan | first2=Fernanda | hdl=2078.1/5773 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barcelona GSE has been ranked by RePEc among the top 35 Economic Research Institutions&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.inst.all.html|title=Economic Institution Rankings at IDEAS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the top 20 Economics Departments in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.econdept.html | title = Rankings at IDEAS: Economics Departments  | accessdate = 2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top 10 in Europe and as the best in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.europe.html | title = Rankings at IDEAS: Europe  | accessdate = 2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severo Ochoa Research Excellence Accreditation===
In 2011, the School was distinguished as one of only eight top research institutions of excellence with an international impact in the framework of the Severo Ochoa Research Excellence Program, which promotes frontier research and distinguish those institutions that are defining the global scientific debate. In 2016, it became the only center focused on [[Economics]] and the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] to receive a second Severo Ochoa distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barcelonagse.eu/news/severo-ochoa-research-excellence-distinction-2016-2019|title=Barcelona GSE awarded second Severo Ochoa Research Excellence Distinction for 2016-2019|last=|first=|date=2015-10-27|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biology and political orientation''' is a concept based on a number of studies that have found that [[biology]] can be linked with political orientation.&lt;ref name=Jost2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Amodio, David M.|title=Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=13 November 2011|volume=36|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1007/s11031-011-9260-7|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost-Amodio-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that biology is a possible factor in political orientation, but may also mean that the [[ideology]] a person identifies with changes a person's ability to perform certain tasks. Many of the studies linking biology to politics remain controversial and unreplicated, although the overall body of evidence is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nature.com/news/biology-and-ideology-the-anatomy-of-politics-1.11645 |title=Biology and ideology: The anatomy of politics |last=Buchen |first=Lizzie |date=2012-10-25 |website=Nature |pages=466–468 |language=en |doi=10.1038/490466a |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural differences===
Recent research points at substantial differences in the cognitive styles of [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] on psychological measures.&lt;ref name=JJ1&gt;{{cite journal|title= Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. |url=http://contracabal.com/PDF/Jost-1.pdf | author=J.

A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist [[Ryota Kanai]]'s group at [[University College London]] published in ''[[Current Biology]]'', found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in [[brain]] structures in a [[Accidental sampling|convenience sample]] of students from [[University College London]].&lt;ref name=RK&gt;{{cite journal|title=Political Orientations Are Correlated with Brain Structure in Young Adults |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211002892 |author=R.

In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume was significantly associated with conservativism in the left [[insular cortex|insula]] and the right [[entorhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to [[Disgust#Political orientation|disgust]]&lt;ref name=YI&gt;{{cite journal|title= Conservatives are more easily disgusted than liberals. |url=http://yoelinbar.net/papers/disgust_conservatism.pdf | author=Y.

The authors concluded that, "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes."&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; In an interview with [[LiveScience]], Ryota Kanai said, "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude."&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=HL/&gt;&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/13608-brain-political-ideology-liberal-conservative.html | title=Politics on the Brain: Scans Show Whether You Lean Left or Right | publisher=[[LiveScience]] | accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/29415110_1_brain-structure-political-orientation-liberals-and-conservatives | title=The liberal brain?

===Functional differences===
A study by scientists at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found differences in how self-described liberal and conservative research participants responded to changes in patterns.&lt;ref name=NN&gt;David M Amodio, John T Jost, Sarah L Master &amp; Cindy M Yee, [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n10/abs/nn1979.html Neurocognitive correlates of liberalism and conservatism], ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]''. Cited by [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Neurocognitive+correlates+of+liberalism+and+conservatism%E2%80%8E%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 69 other studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were asked to tap a keyboard when the letter "M" appeared on a computer monitor and to refrain from tapping when they saw a "W". The letter "M" appeared four times more frequently than "W", conditioning participants to press the keyboard on almost every trial. Liberal participants made fewer mistakes than conservatives when they saw the rare "W", indicating to the researchers that these participants were better able to accept changes or conflicts in established patterns. The participants were also wired to an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] that recorded activity in their anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that detects conflicts between a habitual tendency and a more appropriate response. Liberals were significantly more likely than conservatives to show activity in the brain circuits that deal with conflicts during the experiment, and this correlated with their greater accuracy in the test. The lead author of the study, David Amodio, warned against concluding that a particular political orientation is superior. "The tendency of conservatives to block distracting information could be a good thing depending on the situation," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/09/10/brains-of-liberals-conservatives-may-work-differently/1691.html|title=Brains of Liberals, Conservatives May Work Differently|publisher=Psych Central|date=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,2687256.story|title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[fMRI]] study published in ''[[Social Neuroscience]]'', three different patterns of brain activation were found to correlate with individualism, conservatism, and radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Individualism, conservatism, and radicalism as criteria for processing political beliefs: a parametric fMRI study | pmid = 19562629 | doi=10.1080/17470910902860308 | volume=4 | issue=5 | year=2009 | pages=367–83 |vauthors=Zamboni G, Gozzi M, Krueger F, Duhamel JR, Sirigu A, Grafman J | journal=Social Neuroscience}} Zamboni G, Gozzi M, Krueger F, Duhamel JR, Sirigu A, Jordan Grafman.

==Genetic studies==

===Heritability===
[[Heritability]] compares differences in genetic factors in individuals to the total [[variance]] of observable characteristics ("[[phenotype]]s") in a population, to determine the heritability coefficient. Factors including [[genetics]], [[environmental factor|environment]] and random chance can all contribute to the variation in individuals' phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raj | first1 = A | last2 = van Oudenaarden | first2 = A | year = 2008 | title = Nature, nurture, or chance: stochastic gene expression and its consequences | journal = Cell| volume =  135| issue = | pages =  216–26| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.050 | pmid = 18957198 | pmc=3118044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Twin study|twin studies]] assumes the elimination of non-genetic differences by finding the statistical differences between [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins, which have almost the same genes, and [[dizygotic]] (fraternal) twins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genepi.qimr.edu.au/contents/p/staff/CV190Martin_UQ_Copy.pdf A twin-pronged attack on complex traits], N. Martin, D. Boomsma and G. Machin. (1997). ''Nature Genetics'', 17, 387-92. 10.1038/ng1297-387&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of the environment in which twins are reared has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Beckwith and Corey A. Morris. Twin Studies of Political Behavior: Untenable Assumptions? Perspectives on Politics (2008), 6 : pp 785-791&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Social Psychology, Volume 1. Susan T. Fiske, Daniel T. Gilbert, Gardner Lindzey. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 twin study examined the attitudes regarding 28 different political issues such as capitalism, unions, X-rated movies, abortion, school prayer, divorce, property taxes, and the draft. Twins were asked if they agreed or disagreed or were uncertain about each issue. Genetic factors accounted for 53% of the variance of an overall score. However, self-identification as Republican and Democrat had a much lower heritability of 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/science/21gene.html?pagewanted=all | title=Some Politics May Be Etched in the Genes | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=June 21, 2005 | accessdate=September 25, 2012 | author=Carey, Benedict}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alford | first1 = J.

Jost et al. wrote in a 2011 review that "Many studies involving quite diverse samples and methods suggest that political and religious views reﬂect a reasonably strong genetic basis, but this does not mean that ideological proclivities are unaffected by personal experiences or environmental factors."&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt;

===Gene associations studies===
"A Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes" by Peter K. Hatemi et al. traces DNA research involving 13,000 subjects. The study identifies several genes potentially connected with political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hatemi | first1 = P. K. | last2 = Gillespie | first2 = N.

==Physiology and behavior==
Persons with right-wing views had greater [[electrodermal activity|skin conductance]] response, indicating greater [[sympathetic nervous system]] response, to threatening images than those with left-wing views in one study. There was no difference for positive or neutral images. Holding right-wing views was also associated with a stronger [[startle response|startle reflex]] as measured by strength of eyeblink in response to unexpected noise.&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt; A study of subjects' reported level of [[disgust]] linked to various scenarios showed that people who scored highly on the "disgust sensitivity" scale held more politically conservative views.&lt;ref&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology==
From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, conflicts regarding [[redistribution of wealth]] may have been a recurrent issue in the ancestral environment. Humans may therefore have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their chance of succeeding in such conflicts which will affect their political views. For males, physical strength may have been an important factor in deciding the outcome of such conflicts. Therefore, a prediction is that males having high physical strength and low socioeconomic stratum (SES) will support redistribution while males having both high SES and high physical strength will oppose redistribution. Cross-cultural research found this to be the case. For females, their physical strength had no influence on their political views which was as expected since females rarely have physical strength above that of the average male.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. The evolutionary psychology of Mass Politics. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on political attitudes among [[Hollywood]] actors found that, while the actors were generally more left-leaning, male actors with great physical strength were more likely to support the Republican stance on foreign issues and foreign military interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9197597/Strong-men-more-likely-to-vote-Conservative.html | title=Strong men more likely to vote Conservative | publisher=''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]'' | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative evolutionary explanation for political diversity is that it is a [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], like those of gender and blood type, resulting from [[frequency-dependent selection]].  Tim Dean has suggested that we live in such a [[Pragmatic ethics#Moral ecology|moral ecosystem]] whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches&lt;ref name=Dean2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = T. | title = Evolution and Moral Diversity | doi = 10.4148/biyclc.v7i0.1775 | journal = The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication | volume = 7 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. political balance promotes survival of the human species).

'''''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation''''', a [[style guide]], prescribes the most widely used [[legal citation]] system in the United States. ''The Bluebook'' is compiled by the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' Association, the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. Currently, it is in its 20th edition. It is so named because its cover is blue.

''The Bluebook'' is taught and used at a majority of [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]], and is also used in a majority of [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal courts]]. Alternative legal citation style guides exist, including the ''[[Maroonbook]]'' and the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]''. There are also several "house" citation styles used by legal publishers in their works.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their [[law clerk]]s obtained their [[Legal education in the United States|legal education]] at law schools that use ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref name="Salmon1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=792|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many [[state court (United States)|state courts]] have their own citation rules that take precedence over ''The Bluebook'' for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to ''The Bluebook'' system, such as [[Maryland]]'s requirement that citations to Maryland cases include a reference to the official Maryland reporter. [[Delaware]]'s [[Supreme Court of Delaware|Supreme Court]] has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from ''The Bluebook'' standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the [[Delaware Code]] also differs from ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 Rule 14(g)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190900/http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |date=2016-03-03 }}, Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, notably [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Michigan]], the local rules are different from ''The Bluebook'' in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states who practice both in federal court and state court must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court.

== History ==

According to Harvard, the origin of ''The Bluebook'' was a pamphlet for proper citation forms for articles in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' written by its editor, [[Erwin Griswold]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hurt, ''The Bluebook at Eighteen: Reflecting and Ratifying Current Trends in Legal Scholarship'', 82 {{smallcaps|Ind. L.J.}} 49, 51-52 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a recent study by two [[Yale]] librarians,&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro &amp; Julie Graves Krishnaswami, ''The Secret History of the Bluebook'', [http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ShapiroKrishnaswami_ONLINEPDF.pdf 100 {{smallcaps|Minn. L. Rev.}} 1563] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's claim is incorrect. They trace the origin of ''The Bluebook'' to a 1920 publication by [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] at Yale on how to write law journal materials for the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Karl N. Llewellyn, The Writing of a Case Note}} (1920). This booklet had a blue cover, which Shapiro and Krishnaswami point out is "appropriate for its University," whose official color is blue.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors point out that some of the material in the 1926 first edition of ''The Bluebook'' (as well as that in a 1922 Harvard precursor to it published as ''Instructions for Editorial Work'') duplicate material in the 1920 Llewellen booklet and its 1921 successor, a blue pamphlet that the ''Yale Law Journal'' published as ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bluebook'' 1 (1926) has approximately 30 sentences in common with ''Yale Law Journal'' ’s ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation'' (1921), as well as many of the sample citations, all of the proofreading signs, and virtually all of the items in the long list of abbreviations. They both begin with the same sentence: “This pamphlet does not pretend to include a complete list of abbreviations or all the necessary data as to form.” The subtitle of the ''Bluebook'' is “Abbreviations and Form of Citation.” The ''Jones v. Smith'' Connecticut citation that is the basic case citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic case example used in Bluebook 1. The Haines ''Yale Law Journal'' citation that is the basic periodical citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic periodical example used in ''Bluebook'' 1. Most of the section on treatises is identical between 1921 and 1926.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years before the first edition of ''The Bluebook'' appeared, Yale, Columbia, and several other law journals "worked out a tentative citation plan," but Harvard initially opposed it "because of skepticism as to the results to be attained and in part because of a desire not to deviate from our forms especially at the solicitation of other Reviews." Eventually, Harvard "reversed course" and joined the coalition by 1926. According to Judge [[Henry J. Friendly]], "Attorney General [Herbert] Brownell, whom I had known ever since law school—he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Yale Law Journal'' the year I was at the ''Harvard Law Review'' and he and I and two others [from Columbia and Pennsylvania] were the authors of the first edition of the ''Bluebook''."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Dorsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ctStY3580C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era}}] 71 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the 1926 ''A Uniform System of Citation'' was green. The color was "brown from the second (1928) edition through the fifth (1936) edition. It was only with the sixth (1939) edition that it became blue."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the cover of the book was changed from brown to a "more patriotic blue" allegedly to avoid comparison with a color associated with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Darby Dickerson, ''An Un-Uniform System of Citation: Surviving with the New Bluebook'', 26 {{smallcaps|Stetson L. Rev.}} 53, 58-60 (1996). According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami, however, "The abandonment of brown is often attributed to the association of that color with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but that idea appears to trace to a joke by Alan Strasser," in [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hcrcl12&amp;id=515&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Alan%20Strasser&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=10 ''Technical Due Process: ?''], 12 {{smallcaps|Harv. C.R.-C.L. Rev.}} 507, 508 (1977). Strasser states, referring to the eleventh edition's change of cover color to white with a blue border promising a "new life," that "the 1939 ''Blue Book'' had electrified the nation by parading patriotic blue covers instead of the Germanic brown ones that had disgraced the 1936 edition." ''Id''. (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; The eleventh edition, published in 1967, was actually white with a blue border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160302144344/http://blawg.law.sc.edu/2015/07/13/all-the-fun-facts-about-the-bluebook/ ''All the Fun Facts about the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; The cover color returned to blue in the twelfth edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Strasser, at 508. Strasser states that the first printing was a "timid" blue-gray but later printings were a "more self-assured" navy blue. ''Id''. n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the first (1926) through the fifteenth (1991) editions are available on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192512/https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx Introduction]'', {{smallcaps|Bluebook.com}}, (2010), (archived from the [https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx original] June 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bluebook'' uses two different styles.  The first is used by practitioners in preparing court documents and memoranda, while the second is used primarily in academic settings, such as [[law reviews]] and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Deborah E. Bouchoux}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=cite+checker+bouchoux&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yd6_SArt3B&amp;sig=uWjCbuvyeYJSxn0kLnnTwy7kz-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9ppr1vPDKAhVKOSYKHdmVC4cQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=cite%20checker%20bouchoux&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Cite-Checker: A Hands-on Guide to Learning Citation Form}}] 9 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter uses specific formatting to identify types of references, such as the use of [[small caps]] for books, newspapers, and law reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A rule of thumb used by many is to see if the formatting can be reproduced on a [[typewriter]]—if so, it is used by practitioners, if it requires typesetting, it is used for academic articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, ''The Bluebook'' was "the main guide and source of authority" on legal references for the past 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|William H. Putman}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing}} 468 (4th ed. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recognized as the "gold standard" for legal references in the United States, even though it originally was designed only to help teach law students how to cite cases and other legal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although other citation systems exist, they have limited acceptance, and in general, ''The Bluebook'' is followed in legal citation as the most widely accepted citation style.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468; {{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 2; Kroski, at 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states have adopted ''The Bluebook'' in full, while others have partially adopted ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  States such as Texas have supplements, such as the "Greenbook", that merely address citation issues unique to Texas and otherwise follow ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Brandon D. Quarles &amp; Matthew C. Cordon}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner}} 16 (2003); {{smallcaps|The Greenbook: Texas Rules of Form}} iv (12th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

=== Federal ===
The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] issues a style guide that is designed to supplement ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Solicitor General's Style Guide}} 1 (Jack Metzler ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  This guide focuses on citation for practitioners, so as an example, only two type faces are used for law reviews, normal and italics.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other changes are also minor, such as moving ''supra'' from before the page referenced to after the page number.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide does state that unless explicitly specified otherwise, ''The Bluebook'' rule takes precedence in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State ===
California used to require use of the ''California Style Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Edward W. Jessen}}, {{smallcaps|California Style Manual}} 1 (4th ed. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] issued a rule giving an option of using either the ''California Style Manual'' or ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Calif. R. of Ct. 1.200; {{smallcaps|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation}} 30 (Mary Miles Prince ed., 19th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The two styles are significantly different in citing cases, in use of ''Ibid'' or ''Id.'' (for ''{{lang|la|Idem}}''), and in citing books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libguides.law.ucla.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=92912 Legal Research and Writing Manual]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', {{smallcaps|UCLA School of Law}} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan uses a separate official citation system, issued as an administrative order of the Michigan Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Elan S. Nichols, ''Checklists for Drafting, Formatting, and Submitting Litigation and Other Documents: Instructive Material for Law Students Practicing in Law School Clinics, and Reminders for the Practicing Attorney and Her Staff'', 15 {{smallcaps|T.M. Cooley J. Prac. &amp; Clinical L.}} 57, 58 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary difference is that the Michigan system "omits all periods in citations, uses italics somewhat differently, and does not use 'small caps.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, at 58 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, Texas merely supplements ''The Bluebook'' with items that are unique to Texas courts, such as citing to cases when Texas was an independent republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 101.&lt;/ref&gt; petition and writ history,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] Opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar issues.

== Reception ==

=== Criticism of ''Bluebook''{{'}}s prolixity ===

At over 500 pages for the 19th edition, ''The Bluebook'' is significantly more complicated than the citation systems used by most other fields. Legal scholars have called for its replacement with a simpler system.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The Bluebook Blues]'', 120 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 850-861 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago]] uses the simplified "[[Maroonbook]]",&lt;ref&gt;80 {{smallcaps|[http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/maroonbook The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation]}} 1 (Bradley G. Hubbard, Taylor A.R. Meehan, &amp; Kenneth A. Young eds. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and even simpler systems are in use by other parties.

Judge [[Richard Posner]] is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2797&amp;context=journal_articles Goodbye to the Bluebook]'', 53 {{smallcaps|Chi. L. Rev.}} 1343 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject." In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that a cursory look at the Nineteenth Edition "put [him] in mind of Mr. [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]]’s dying words in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''—'The horror! The horror!' "&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Post called it "the most boring piece of intellectual property imaginable." Adam Liptak described it as "a comically elaborate thicket of random and counterintuitive rules about how to cite judicial decisions, law review articles and the like [that] is both grotesque and indispensable." [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner personally uses a far simpler citation system based largely on the First Edition of the ''Bluebook''. This system, which he includes in a manual he provides for his law clerks, was reprinted in the aforementioned ''Yale Law Journal'' article. At the time of the article, his citation system was 885 ''words'' long, or about two printed pages—far shorter than the 511 pages of the Nineteenth Edition, the 640 pages of the then-current ''ALWD Citation Manual'', or the over 1,000 pages of the ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Manual of Style]]''.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;

=== ''BabyBlue'' copyright controversy ===
[[File:Cover of Baby Blue's Manual of Legal Citation.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[BabyBlue]]'']]
[[File:The Indigo Book cover.png|thumb|''[[Indigo Book]]'' cover]]

Another dispute is over the copyright status of ''The Bluebook''.  Open-source advocates claim that ''The Bluebook'' is not protected under copyright because it is a critical piece of legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, according to NYU Professor Christopher Sprigman, "the copyright for the 10th edition of the tome, published in 1958, was never renewed, and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that means it is in the public domain." See [http://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/yale-law-students-support-the-end-of-the-bluebook/?rf=1 ''Yale Law Students Support The End Of The Bluebook''], {{smallcaps|Above the Law}} (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" are protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | title=Legal minds differ on whether The Bluebook is subject to copyright protection | date=February 1, 2015 | author=Leslie A. Gordon | url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/legal_minds_differ_on_whether_the_bluebook_is_subject_to_copyright_protecti | access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group led by Professor Christopher J. Sprigman at NYU Law School has been preparing a "public-domain implementation of the ''Bluebook''{{’}}s Uniform System of Citation." which his group calls ''BabyBlue''. However, a law firm (Ropes &amp; Gray) representing the Harvard Law Review Association (HLRA) sent him a letter stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e believe that ''[[BabyBlue]]'' may include content identical or substantially similar to content or other aspects of ''The Bluebook'' that constitute original works of authorship protected by copyright, and which are covered by various United States copyright registrations.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[M]y client has been and remains concerned that the publication and promotion of such a work may infringe the Reviews’ copyright rights in ''The Bluebook'' and ''The Bluebook'' Online, and may cause substantial, irreparable harm to the Reviews and their rights and interests in those works.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[I]t is our client’s position that the title ''BabyBlue'', or any title consisting of or comprising the word “Blue,” when used on or in connection with your work, would so resemble the ''BLUEBOOK'' Marks as to be likely, to cause confusion, mistake, and/or deception…Accordingly, and to avoid any risk of consumer confusion, my client respectfully demands that you agree (i) not to use the title or name ''BabyBlue'', or any other title or name including the word “blue,” for your work.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter quoted in Jacob Gershman, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/12/28/bluebook-critics-incite-copyright-clash/?mod=WSJBlog ''Bluebook Critics Incite Copyright Clash''], {{smallcaps|Wall Street Journal Law Blog}} (Dec. 28, 2015), and in Mike Masnick, ''Harvard Law Review Freaks Out, Sends Christmas Eve Threat Over Public Domain Citation Guide''], in {{smallcaps|Techdirt}} (Dec. 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the HLRA letter to Sprigman, over 150 students, faculty, staff and alumni of Harvard Law School signed a petition in support of ''BabyBlue''. Yale and NYU students added their separate petitions supporting ''BabyBlue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/harvard-law-review-should-welcome-free-citation-manual-not-threaten-lawsuits/ ''Harvard Law Review Should Welcome Free Citation Manual, Not Threaten Lawsuits''], {{smallcaps|Harvard Law Record}} (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A posting in the ''Harvard Law Record'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual property claims that the HLR Association made may or may not be spurious. But independent of that, the tactics employed by the HLR Association’s counsel in dealing with Mr. Malamud and Prof. Sprigman are deplorable. The Harvard Law Review claims to be an organization that promotes knowledge and access to legal scholarship. It is a venerated part of the traditions of Harvard Law School. But these actions by the Harvard Law Review speak of competition and not of justice.&lt;ref name="''id''."&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The posting also suggested that HLRA should "redirect the money it spends on legal fees ($185,664 in 2013)" to a more worthy purpose.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt;

David Post commented: "It’s copyright nonsense, and Harvard should be ashamed of itself for loosing its legal hounds to dispense it in order to protect its (apparently fairly lucrative) publication monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that the project had changed its name to the ''[[Indigo Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Michael|title=Response|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2806393/Harvard-Response-20160331.pdf|publisher=public.resource.org|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial controversy ==

Revenues from the sale of the ''Bluebook'' are estimated "in the millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro and Julie Graves Krishnaswami, [http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=308111088105096097087001004108109007054027040080070045096086028073001068126123008002126026116029049096000076016091095116108107016036036048035081098124089024081068068022023075002115125103105125088011113029091090012067007071118120093113072117092124096115&amp;EXT=pdf ''The Secret History of the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 50 years, the Harvard Law Review kept 100 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt; In 1974, the editors of the ''[[Columbia Law Review|Columbia]]'' and ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]s'' and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' apparently discovered this, due to an indiscretion.&lt;ref&gt;According to Joan G. Wexler, Dean and then President of [[Brooklyn Law School]], some members of the ''Harvard Law Review'' disclosed to her at a lunch one day in [[San Francisco]] where they were all summer associates "[w]hat a cash cow" the ''Bluebook'' was for their review. She consulted Professor [[Ralph S. Brown]] at Yale Law School, who taught copyright, and he said "sue them!" See Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; They complained that Harvard was illegally keeping all profits from the first eleven editions, estimated to total $20,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;W. Duane Benton, ''Developments in the Law – Legal Citation'', 86 {{smallcaps|Yale}} L.J. 197, 202 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; After they threatened to sue, and considerable wrangling, Harvard agreed with them to split the revenue: 40 percent for Harvard, 20 percent each for Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale; Harvard would continue to provide the production and distribution services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Legal technology and future ==

The ''Bluebook'' has also been affected by the disruptions to the legal industry due to [[legal technology]].&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[startup company]] LegalEase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LegalEase official website|url=https://www.legaleasecite.com/bluebook-citation-generator}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a [[legal citation]] generator that enables its users to create citations in the ''Bluebook'' format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyberg|first1=Cheryl|title=Bluebook 101 Online Citation Generators|url=http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=375743&amp;p=2550183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
King-Okumu has worked with the [[United Nations University]] (UNU),&lt;ref name="Daley"/&gt; [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD),&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt; and [[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas]] (ICARDA).&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICARDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Caroline|title=Water &amp;  Livelihoods Initiative|url=http://www.icarda.org/wli/pdfs/FirthRegionalCoordinationMeeting/Introduction_WLIRegionalAgenda_11_05.pdf|website=ICARDA|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She has consulted with the Ecosystems and Human Development Association (EHDA)&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt; and has been a Visiting Research Associate at the School of Geography and Environment at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Jaafar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuster-Wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuster-Wallace|first1=Corinne J.|last2=Grover|first2=Velma I.|last3=Adeel|first3=Zafar|last4=Confalonieri|first4=Ulisses|last5=Elliott|first5=Susan|title=Safe Water as the Key to Global Health|url=http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SafeWater_Web_version.pdf|publisher=United Nations University|date=2008|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently she is a senior researcher in the Climate Change Group of the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] (IIED)&lt;ref name="IIED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toulmin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toulmin|first1=Camilla|last2=Hesse|first2=Ced|last3=Tari|first3=Daoud|last4=King–Okumu|first4=Caroline|title=Investing in institutional ‘software’ to build climate resilience|url=http://www.aglobalvillage.org/journal/online/iied/|website=A Global Village|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[London, England]]. IIED is an international organization engaged in policy and action research to support sustainable local development in countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Pacific]].&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.iied.org/about|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King-Okumu studies methods for the sustainable integrated management of water and land in dryland ecosystems, and economic and environmental assessment techniques for calculating the costs of groundwater degradation. She encourages initiatives for decision-making in the context of longer-term considerations of increasing variability and climate change.  She works to develop in-country partnerships engaging government, research institutions, civic groups and the private sector, to support sustainable practices and community-based adaptation and to increase climate change resilience.&lt;ref name="IIED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caroline King-Okumu|url=http://www.iied.org/users/caroline-king-okumu|website=International Institute for Environment and Development|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

King-Okumu analyzes situations in terms of a nexus of interlinked water, energy, and food production concerns rather than focusing solely on water balance and food production.&lt;ref name="Jaafar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Caroline|last2=Jaafar|first2=Hadi|title=Rapid assessment of the water–energy–food–climate nexus in six selected basins of North Africa and West Asia undergoing transitions and scarcity threats|journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development|date=22 April 2015|volume=31|issue=3|pages=343–359|doi=10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07900627.2015.1026436?src=recsys|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coptology''' is the science of [[Copt]]ic studies, the study of Coptic language and literature.&lt;ref name="We"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm Alahram weekly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917024209/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm |date=September 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Copts and the West, 1439-1822: The European Discovery of the Egyptian Church|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho-IXrFvyq8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=history+of+coptology&amp;source=web&amp;ots=u_afXTuU5Q&amp;sig=qG1qijWJuplcAVA7gZrf4_9OSGA|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2006-07-27|isbn = 9780199288779|language = en|first = Alastair|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in [[Cairo]] under the title "Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies" (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the "[[International Association for Coptic Studies]]".&lt;ref name="Int"&gt; [http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/  International Association for Coptic Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011732/http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was [[Pahor Labib]], director of the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Cairo]] during 1951-65. The words 'Coptology' and 'Coptologist' were introduced into the English language by [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs &amp; more|url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PN1YR1HMUGAQ|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide institutions==
There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the [[American University in Cairo]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="We"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">A '''cultural footprint''' is the impact that a group or individual has on the cultural environment.

== Definition ==
“Cultural footprint”&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used in work launched by the association Diversum (“Mesurer et améliorer son empreinte culturelle : nouvelle thématique du développement durable” [“Measuring and Improving One’s Cultural Footprint: The New Topic in Sustainable Development”], Jérôme Gouadain’s contribution to the [https://www.observatoireplurilinguisme.eu/fr/les-actions/assises-berlin-juin-2009-fr-fr-6-1/88888966--sp-161/2207-programme-et-contributions 2nd European Conference on Plurilingualism], Berlin, 19 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was defined in June 2013, at the initiative of a group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society.

They explained it as “all of the externalities, both positive and negative, generated in the cultural environment by agents’ actions”. It is considered to be positive when it enriches [[cultural diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt; or fosters cultural intensity.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;[http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 24 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reference document published in 2017 specified that “all actors have the possibility of activating (i.e. exploring and utilizing) available cultural resources. At the same time, it is their responsibility to make a positive contribution” to that sub-stratum, to that creative atmosphere. This means that groups and individuals must “set requirements for themselves, engage based on their own singularities, and be culturally involved and invested”.

== Applications ==
“The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; is a document to which Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé and Nicole Rouvet contributed. It suggests several aspects of the cultural environment where economics might be able to make a contribution: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''cyberneticist''' or a '''cybernetician''' is a person who practices [[cybernetics]].

[[Heinz von Foerster]] once told [[Stuart Umpleby]] that [[Norbert Wiener]] preferred the term "cybernetician" rather than "cyberneticist",  perhaps because Wiener was a mathematician rather than a physicist.
On the other hand, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] who began as a theoretical physicist, as well as [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] who began his career as a mathematician, regarded  [[Neuro cybernetics]]—and more generally [[Biocybernetics]]—as fields closely allied to [[Mathematical Biology]] and Mathematical Biophysics in which [[control theory]] and [[dynamical system]] theories also play significant roles.

Hutchinson''' (born 1946) is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]], and Master of the undergraduate College's New Collegiate Division where he directs the Law, Letters, and Society program. His interests primarily lie in the field constitutional law, paying special attention to issues of race. Indeed, he is perhaps best known within the legal community at large for his work as Editor of the Law School's ''[[Supreme Court Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Bowdoin College]], and studied briefly as a JD candidate at Chicago before attending  [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in Jurisprudence, where he graduated with a BA and MA. Upon return to the United States, he completed his formal studies at the [[University of Texas Law School]], where he took an [[Master of Law|LLM]]. Hutchinson then served as a law clerk to Justice [[William O. Douglas]] and Justice [[Byron White]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. His biography of ''Whizzer White''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hutchinson-whizzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a ''[[New York Times]]'' 'Notable Book' for 1998.  He was once married to Judge [[Diane Pamela Wood]], who sits on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], and who remains an academic colleague.

Hutchinson was one of several law faculty members who were called upon by various media sources to provide commentary about President Barack Obama's tenure teaching constitutional law at the school, and was largely supportive.

An '''emblem book''' is a [[book]] collecting [[emblem]]s (allegorical illustrations) with accompanying explanatory text, typically morals or poems. This category of books was popular in Europe during the [[16th century in literature|16th]] and [[17th century in literature|17th centuries]].

Emblem books are collections of sets of three elements: an icon or image, a motto, and text explaining the connection between the image and motto.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text ranged in length from a few lines of verse to pages of prose.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; Emblem books descended from medieval bestiaries that explained the importance of animals, proverbs, and fables.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  In fact, writers often drew inspiration from Greek and Roman sources such as [[Aesop's Fables]] and [[Plutarch's Lives]]. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Definition ==
{{quote|But if someone asks me what Emblemata really are? I will reply to him, that they are mute images, and nevertheless speaking: insignificant matters, and none the less of importance: ridiculous things, and nonetheless not without wisdom [...]|Jacob Cats, ''Voor-reden over de Proteus, of Minne-beelden, verandert in sinne-beelden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al de werken van I. Cats|location= Amsterdamfirst= Jan Jacobsz. |last=Schipper|year= 1665|url=http://www.brill.com/sites/default/files/ftp/downloads/31773_Titlelist.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars differ on the key question of whether the actual [[emblem]]s in question are the visual images, the accompanying texts, or the combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This is understandable, given that first emblem book, the ''[[Emblemata]]'' of [[Andrea Alciato]], was first issued in an unauthorized edition in which the [[woodcut]]s were chosen by the printer without any input from the author, who had circulated the texts in unillustrated manuscript form. It contained around a hundred short verses in Latin.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; One image it depicted was the lute which symbolized the need for harmony instead of warfare in the city-states of Italy. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

Some early emblem books were unillustrated, particularly those issued by the French printer Denis de Harsy.&lt;!-- As of 3/2015, there is not even a French article on him.--&gt; With time, however, the reading public came to expect emblem books to contain picture-text combinations. Each combination consisted of a [[woodcut]] or [[engraving]] accompanied by one or more short texts, intended to inspire their readers to reflect on a general [[morality|moral]] lesson derived from the reading of both picture and text together. The picture was subject to numerous interpretations: only by reading the text could a reader be certain which meaning was intended by the author. Thus the books are closely related to the personal symbolic picture-text combinations called [[personal device]]s, known in Italy as ''{{Lang|it|imprese}}'' and in France as ''{{Lang|fr|devises}}''.  Many of the symbolic images present in emblem books were used in other contexts, on clothes, furniture, street signs, and the facades of buildings. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  For instance, a sword and scales symbolized death.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Miscellany == &lt;!-- I'm not happy about the name of this headline, but I couldn't find a better name, and we need one to mark the end of the "Definition" section. --&gt;
Emblem books, both [[secular]] and [[religious]], attained enormous popularity throughout continental Europe, though in Britain they did not capture the imagination of readers to quite the same extent. The books were especially numerous in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France.

Many emblematic works borrowed plates or texts (or both) from earlier exemplars, as was the case with [[Geoffrey Whitney]]'s ''Choice of Emblemes'', a compilation which chiefly used the resources of the [[Plantin Press]] in Leyden.

Early European studies of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], like that of [[Athanasius Kircher]], assumed that the hieroglyphs were emblems, and imaginatively interpreted them accordingly.

A similar collection of emblems, but not in book form, is [[Lady Drury's Closet]].

An '''environmental impact statement''' ('''EIS'''), under [[United States environmental law]], is a document required by the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) for certain actions "significantly affecting the quality of the human environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 USC Sections  4321-4347] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017083720/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm |date=2008-10-17 }} (enacted 1970-01-01) from [http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm Council on Environmental Quality NEPAnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172140/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An EIS is a tool for decision making.  It describes the positive and negative [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental effects]] of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. Several [[U.S. state]] governments require that a document similar to an EIS be submitted to the state for certain actions.  For example, in California, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be submitted to the state for certain actions, as described in the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA). One of the primary authors of the act is [[Lynton K. Caldwell]].

==Purpose==
The purpose of the NEPA is to promote informed decision-making by federal agencies by making "detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts" available to both agency leaders and the public.&lt;ref&gt;See the Supreme Court decision: ''Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council'', 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  The NEPA was the first piece of legislation that created a comprehensive method to assess potential and existing environmental risks at once.  It also encourages communication and cooperation between all the actors involved in environmental decisions, including government officials, private businesses, and citizens.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, an EIS acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the federal government adheres to the goals and policies outlined in the NEPA.  An EIS should be created in a timely manner as soon as the agency is planning development or is presented with a proposal for development.  The statement should use an interdisciplinary approach so that it accurately assesses both the physical and social impacts of the proposed development.&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances an action may be deemed subject to NEPA’s EIS requirement even though the action is not specifically sponsored by a federal agency. These factors may include actions that receive federal funding, federal licensing or authorization, or that are subject to federal control.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2008). [https://www.amazon.com/NEPA-Environmental-Planning-Techniques-Practitioners/dp/0849375592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486526090&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=NEPA+and+Environmental+Planning%3A+Tools%2C+Techniques%2C+and+Approaches+for+Practitioners NEPA and Environmental Planning: Tools, Techniques, and Approaches for Practitioners], pp 148-149. CRC Press. {{ISBN|9780849375590}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all federal actions require a full EIS.  If the action may or may not cause a significant impact, the agency can first prepare a smaller, shorter document called an '''Environmental Assessment''' (EA).  The finding of the EA determines whether an EIS is required.  If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and carry on with the proposed action.  Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS.  Most EAs result in a FONSI.  A limited number of federal actions may avoid the EA and EIS requirements under NEPA if they meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion (CATEX).  A CATEX is usually permitted when a course of action is identical or very similar to a past course of action and the impacts on the environment from the previous action can be assumed for the proposed action, or for building a structure within the footprint of an existing, larger facility or complex.  For example, two proposed sections of [[Interstate 69 in Kentucky]] were granted a CATEX from NEPA requirements as these portions of I-69 will be routed over existing freeways requiring little more than minor spot improvements and a change of highway signage.   Additionally, a CATEX can be issued during an [[emergency]] when time does not permit the preparation of an EA or EIS.  An example of the latter is when the Federal Highway Administration issued a CATEX to construct the [[I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge|replacement bridge]] in the wake of the [[I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse]].

Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, but merely requires that the prospective impacts be understood and disclosed in advance.  The intent of NEPA is to help key decisionmakers and stakeholders balance the need to implement an action with its impacts on the surrounding human and natural environment, and provide opportunities for mitigating those impacts while keeping the cost and schedule for implementing the action under control.  However, many activities require various federal permits to comply with other environmental legislation, such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], [[Endangered Species Act]] and Section 4(f) of the [[Federal Highway Act]] to name a few. Similarly, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted environmental laws and ordinances, requiring additional state and local permits before the action can proceed.  Obtaining these permits typically requires the lead agency to implement the '''Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA)''' to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws that are ancillary to NEPA.  In some instances, the result of NEPA analysis leads to abandonment or cancellation of the proposed action, particularly when the "No Action" alternative ends up being the LEDPA.

==Layout==
An EIS typically has four sections:&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2014). The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements. Chapter 6. CRC Press. {{ISBN|978-1466583634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* An Introduction including a statement of the '''Purpose and Need''' of the '''Proposed Action'''.
:* A description of the '''Affected Environment'''.
:* A '''Range of Alternatives''' to the proposed action.  Alternatives are considered the "heart" of the EIS.
:* An '''analysis''' of the environmental impacts of each of the possible alternatives.  This section covers topics such as:
::* Impacts to '''threatened or endangered species'''
::* '''Air and water quality''' impacts
::* Impacts to '''historic and cultural sites, particularly sites of significant importance to Indigenous peoples. 
::* '''Social and Economic impacts''' to local communities, often including consideration of attributes such as '''impacts to available housing stock, economic impacts to businesses, property values, aesthetics and noise''' within the affected area
::* '''Cost and Schedule Analyses''' for each alternative, including costs and timeline to mitigate expected impacts, to determine if the proposed action can be completed at a acceptable cost and within a reasonable amount of time 
While not required in the EIS, the following subjects may be included as part of the EIS or as separate documents based on agency policy.
:* '''Financial Plan''' for the proposed action identifying the sources of secured funding for the action.  For example, the Federal Highway Administration has started requiring states to include a financial plan showing that funding has been secured for major highway projects before it will approve an EIS and issue a Record of Decision.
:* An '''Environmental Mitigation Plan''' is often requested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if substantial environmental impacts are expected from the preferred alternative.
:* '''Additional documentation''' to comply with state and local environmental policy laws and secure required federal, state, and local permits before the action can proceed.

Every EIS is required to analyze a '''No Action Alternative,''' in addition to the range of alternatives presented for study.  The No Action Alternative identifies the expected environmental impacts in the future if existing conditions were left as is with no action taken by the lead agency.  Analysis of the No Action Alternative is used to establish a baseline upon which to compare the proposed "Action" alternatives.

==NEPA process==
The NEPA process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available information in a single place so that decision makers can be fully informed when they make their choices.

This is the process of EIS
* '''Proposal:''' In this stage, the needs and objectives of a project have been decided, but the project has not been financed.
* '''Categorical Exclusion (CATEX):''' As discussed above, the government may exempt an agency from the process.  The agency can then proceed with the project and skip the remaining steps.
* '''Environmental Assessment (EA):''' The proposal is analyzed in addition to the local environment with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of the development on the area.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI):'''  Occurs when no significant impacts are identified in an EA.  A FONSI typically allows the lead agency to proceed without having to complete an EIS.

''Environmental Impact Statement''
* '''Scoping:''' The first meetings are held to discuss existing laws, the available information, and the research needed.  The tasks are divided up and a lead group is selected.  Decision makers and all those involved with the project can attend the meetings.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Notice:'''  The public is notified that the agency is preparing an EIS.  The agency also provides the public with information regarding how they can become involved in the process.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The agency announces its project proposal with a notice in the [[Federal Register]], notices in local media, and letters to citizens and groups that it knows are likely to be interested. Citizens and groups are welcome to send in comments helping the agency identify the issues it must address in the EIS (or EA).
* '''Draft EIS (DEIS):''' Based on both agency expertise and issues raised by the public, the agency prepares a Draft EIS with a full description of the affected environment, a reasonable range of alternatives, and an analysis of the impacts of each alternative.
* '''Comment:''' Affected individuals then have the opportunity to provide feedback through written and public hearing statements.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Final EIS (FEIS) and Proposed Action:''' Based on the comments on the Draft EIS, the agency writes a Final EIS, and announces its Proposed Action.  The public is not invited to comment on this, but if they are still unhappy, or feel that the agency has missed a major issue, they may protest the EIS to the Director of the agency.  The Director may either ask the agency to revise the EIS, or explain to the protester why their complaints are not actually taken care of.
*'''Re-evaluation:'''  Prepared following an approved FEIS or ROD when unforeseen changes to the proposed action or its impacts occurs, or when a substantial period of time has passed between approval of an action and the planned start of said action.  Based on the significance of the changes, three outcomes may result from a re-evaluation report:  (1) the action may proceed with no substantive changes to the FEIS, (2) significant impacts are expected with the change that can be adequately addressed in a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or (3) the circumstances force a complete change in the nature and scope of the proposed action, thereby voiding the pre-existing FEIS (and ROD, if applicable), requiring the lead agency to restart the NEPA process and prepare a new EIS to encompass the changes.
* '''Supplemental EIS (SEIS):''' Typically prepared after either a Final EIS or Record of Decision has been issued and new environmental impacts that were not considered in the original EIS are discovered, requiring the lead agency to re-evaluate its initial decision and consider new alternatives to avoid or mitigate the new impacts.  Supplemental EISs are also prepared when the size and scope of a federal action changes, when a significant period of time has lapsed since the FEIS was completed to account for changes in the surrounding environment during that time, or when all of the proposed alternatives in an EIS are deemed to have unacceptable environmental impacts and new alternatives are proposed.
* '''[[Record of Decision]] (ROD):''' Once all the protests are resolved the agency issues a Record of Decision which is its final action prior to implementation.  If members of the public are still dissatisfied with the outcome, they may sue the agency in Federal court.

Often, the agencies responsible for preparing an EA or EIS do not compile the document directly, but outsource this work to private-sector consulting firms with expertise in the proposed action and its anticipated effects on the environment.  Because of the intense level of detail required in analyzing the alternatives presented in an EIS or EA, such documents may take years or even decades to compile, and often compose of multiple volumes that can be thousands to tens of thousands of pages in length.

To avoid potential conflicts in securing required permits and approvals after the ROD is issued, the lead agency will often coordinate with stakeholders at all levels, and resolve any conflicts to the greatest extent possible during the EIS process.  Proceeding in this fashion helps avoid interagency conflicts and potential lawsuits after the lead agency reaches its decision.

===Tiering===
On exceptionally large projects, especially proposed highway and railroad corridors that cross long distances, the lead agency may use a two-tiered process prior to implementing the proposed action.  In such cases, the Tier I EIS would analyze the potential socio-environmental impacts along a general corridor, but would not identify the exact location of where the action would occur.  A Tier I ROD would be issued approving the general area where the action would be implemented.  Following the Tier I ROD, the approved Tier I area is further broken down into subareas, and a Tier II EIS is then prepared for each subarea, that identifies the exact location of where the proposed action will take place.  The preparation of Tier II EISs for each subarea proceeds at its own pace, independent from the other subareas within the Tier I area. For example, parts of the proposed [[Interstate 69]] extension in [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]] are being studied through a two-tiered process

==Strengths==
By requiring agencies to complete an EIS, the act encourages them to consider the environmental costs of a project and introduces new information into the decision-making process.  The NEPA has increased the influence of environmental analysts and agencies in the federal government by increasing their involvement in the development process.  Because an EIS requires expert skill and knowledge, agencies must hire environmental analysts.  Unlike agencies who may have other priorities, analysts are often sympathetic to environmental issues.  In addition, this feature introduces scientific procedures into the political process.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"&gt;Taylor, Serge. 1984. "Making Bureaucracies Think: The Environmental Impact Statement Strategy of Administrative Reform". Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The differences that exist between science and politics limit the accuracy of an EIS.  Although analysts are members of the scientific community, they are affected by the political atmosphere.  Analysts do not have the luxury of an unlimited time for research.  They are also affected by the different motives behind the research of the EIS and by different perspectives of what constitutes a good analysis.  In addition, government officials do not want to reveal an environmental problem from within their own agency.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"/&gt;

Citizens often misunderstand the environmental assessment process.  The public does not realize that the process is only meant to gather information relevant to the decision.  Even if the statement predicts negative impacts of the project, decision makers can still proceed with the proposal.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

Environmental impact statements presented to citizens and government officials frequently include very precise data.  However, the quality and context of the data, such as the margin of error and the range, is omitted.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

'''Environmental vegetarianism''' is the practice of [[vegetarianism]] or eating a [[plant-based diet]] based on the indications that animal-based industries are environmentally destructive or [[sustainable development|unsustainable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/weekinreview/27bittman.html|title=Rethinking the Meat-Guzzler|first=Mark|last=Bittman|date=27 January 2008|access-date=8 November 2017|publisher=The New York Times|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary environmental concerns with animal products are [[pollution]]—including [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (GHG)—[[deforestation]], and the use of resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[Water crisis|water]], and land.

==Environmental impact of animal products==
{{Main article|Environmental impact of meat production}}[[File:Sources of dietary energy-consumtion (%) 2001-2003 (FAO).svg|thumb|400px|right|According to an [[FAO]] report, the predicted increase in [[animal product]] consumption by people living in [[Developing country|developing countries]] will bring new challenges to global [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/Portals/_Faostat/documents/pdf/sources_of_dietary_energy_consumption.pdf|title=FAOSTAT|website=faostat.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609617530 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0 | volume=374 | issue=9706 | title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture | journal=The Lancet | pages=2016–2025 | year=2009 | last1 = Friel | first1 = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to animal products range from 18% to 51% of total global emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/study-claims-meat-creates-half-of-all-greenhouse-gases-1812909.html|title=Study claims meat creates half of all greenhouse gases|date=1 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=November 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=E10301–E10308 | last1 = White | first1 = Robin R. | last2 = Beth Hall | first2 = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in the journal ''[[Carbon Balance and Management]]'' found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wolf|first1=Julie|last2=Asrar |first2=Ghassem R. |last3= West|first3=Tristram O.|date=September 29, 2017 |title=Revised methane emissions factors and spatially distributed annual carbon fluxes for global livestock|url=https://cbmjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|journal=[[Carbon Balance and Management]]|volume=12 |issue=16 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13021-017-0084-y|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in ''Climate Change'' concluded "if ... average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17 %. Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y#/page-1 | doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1329-y | volume=129 | title=The potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK through healthy and realistic dietary change | journal=Climatic Change | pages=253–265 | year=2015 | last1 = Green | first1 = Rosemary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006 [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) report ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', animal agriculture contributes on a "massive scale" to [[global warming]], air pollution, [[land degradation]], energy use, [[deforestation]], and [[biodiversity]] decline.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO report estimates that the [[livestock]] (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] equivalents. This estimate was based on [[life-cycle analysis]], including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP ([[global warming potential]]) of  23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. The FAO report concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global".&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt;

Some sources{{Citation needed|reason=Which sources?|date=May 2016}} disagree with some of the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic [[methane emissions]] are attributable to the livestock sector, and a [[NASA]] summary indicates about 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Augenbraun, H.|author2=E.

Data of a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) study indicate that about 0.97 percent of energy use in the United States is accounted for by raising food-producing livestock and poultry. In this context, energy use includes energy from fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, technological solar, and wind sources. The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R.

A 2010 report from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]'s (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |year= 2010|title= Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials|publisher= UNEP|publication-place= |page= 82|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Portals/24102/PDFs/PriorityProductsAndMaterials_Report.pdf |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-un"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Cornell University]] scientists: "The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable".&lt;ref name=PimentelPimentel2003/&gt; However, they also write: "The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet.

He "depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein", but "distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= August 7, 1997|title= U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat, Cornell ecologist advises animal scientists|url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat|newspaper= [[Cornell Chronicle]]|location= |access-date= 19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2002 paper:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing [[meat consumption]]. To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horrigan|first= Leo|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert S|last3= Walker|first3= Polly|date= May 2002|title= How Sustainable Agriculture Can Address the Environmental and Human Health Harms of Industrial Agriculture|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240832/pdf/ehp0110-000445.pdf|journal= [[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|publisher= |volume= 110|issue= 5|pages= 445–456|doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110445|access-date=17 July 2015 |pmc=1240832 |pmid=12003747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2003 paper published in the [[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]], after calculating effects on energy, land, and water use, concluded that meat-based diets require more resources and are less sustainable than [[lacto-ovo vegetarian]] diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/660S|title=Sustainability of meat-based and plant-based diets and the environment|first1=David|last1=Pimentel|first2=Marcia|last2=Pimentel|date=1 September 2003|publisher=|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=78|issue=3|pages=660S–663S|via=ajcn.nutrition.org|pmid=12936963|doi=10.1093/ajcn/78.3.660s}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The water required for a meat-eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000-litre-a-day vegetarian diet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watereducation.org/aquafornia-news/solution-worlds-water-woes-rising-populations-and-growing-demand-making-world|title=Solution for the world's water woes: Rising populations and growing demand is making the world a thirsty planet; the solution lies in people reducing the size of their "water footprints" - Water Education Foundation|website=www.watereducation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a [[desertification]] process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;Bharati et al. 2002. Agroforestry Systems 56: 249-257&lt;/ref&gt; Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.

Animal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage. According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat. Raising a large amount of livestock creatives a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming. As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste. Livestock in the United States produces 2.7 trillion pounds of manure each year,  which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U.S. population. There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/the-environmental-impact-of-a-meat-based-diet|title=The Environmental Impact of a Meat-Based Diet|last=admin|date=2007-04-04|work=Vegetarian Times|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental vegetarianism can be compared with [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism either out of necessity or because of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy. Such a person may base this belief on a philosophical viewpoint, such as the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound or that vegetarianism will help improve public health, lead to global food security, and curb [[starvation]].&lt;ref name="The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Startling Effects of Going Vegetarian for Just One Day|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|accessdate=10 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007180810/http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day|archivedate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eat Better and Improve Your Health For Less Money|url=http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|accessdate=10 February 2013|author=Katherine Manning|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114192717/http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/blog/health/economic-advantages-vegetarian-diet|archivedate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US. According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]], "Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030428144241/http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-04-28|title=UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "the [[ecological footprint]] of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2004/english/ch3/|title=State of World Population 2004 - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] calls [[malnutrition]] "the silent emergency", and says that it is a factor in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths which occur every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3559542.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hungry world 'must eat less meat' | date=August 16, 2004 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade-48538"&gt;http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=48538  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405194659/http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=48538 |date=April 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some{{who|date=October 2011}} argue that the adoption of an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.)&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, E. et al. 1999. Animal Agriculture and Global Food Supply. Council on Agricultural Science and Technology. 92 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis).&lt;ref&gt;USDA.  2010. Agricultural Statistics 2010, Table 13-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
[[Bill Mollison]] has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion. This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact. On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. 2009. Summary report 2007 national resources inventory. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 123 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]] has also developed [[forest gardening]], which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Gardening|author=Robert Hart|year=1996|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=forest%20gardening%20robert%20hart%20simple%20living&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. [[Environmentalist]] Dave Riley states that "being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us", and notes that Mollison "insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/5814|title= Does meat make the meal?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others assert that "the vegan diet wastes available land that could otherwise be used to feed more people", but still conclude that a dairy-friendly vegetarian diet is the most sustainable when compared to 9 other diets, some more influenced by vegetarianism than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/|title=Being vegan isn’t as good for humanity as you think|first=Chase|last=Purdy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:State Normal School, Fitchburg, MA.jpg|thumb|The State Normal School in Fitchburg]]Fitchburg State University was founded as the '''State Normal School in Fitchburg''' in 1894 by the [[Massachusetts General Court|state legislature]]. Its first President was John G. Thompson (President 1895–1920). Initially a secondary-education school for women (coeducation arrived in 1911), the Normal School was not authorized to grant bachelor's degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920–1927), and during Dr. Charles M. Herlihy's (1927–1945) tenure. In 1932, that authorization was extended to all academic disciplines in Education. At the same time, the name was changed to '''State Teachers College at Fitchburg'''. Dr. Charles M. Herlihy died while in office and was succeeded by Dr. William J. Sanders (1945–1950) and Ellis F. White (1950–1953).

During Ralph H. Weston's (1953–1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus. That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to '''State College at Fitchburg''' and added degree programs outside of Education. In 1965, the college's name evolved into '''Fitchburg State College'''. James J. Hammond (1963–1975),  Dr. Vincent J. Mara (1975–1995), and Dr. Michael P. Riccards (1995-2002) were the next three presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.

Under the guidance of President Robert V. Antonucci (2003–2015), the university focused on enhancing its buildings and grounds in addition to growing its academic programs. The school focused on renovations and rehabilitation of underused buildings and areas as opposed to extensive building. Notable buildings include the {{convert|3500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} campus police station (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitchburgpride.com/news/2008/0829/front_page/002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030922/http://www.fitchburgpride.com/news/2008/0829/front_page/002.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Antonucci Science Complex, which included new construction combined with the renovation of the Condike Science Building, in 2011.

Continuing Education at the institution began in the summer of 1915. In 1935 the first graduate programs were established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/aboutus/history/ Fitchburg State College - History of the College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023101904/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/aboutus/history/ |date=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to rename Fitchburg State College to '''Fitchburg State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mass.gov/legis/186history/h04864.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=818{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002323/http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard S. Lapidus (2015-present) has established the Office for Institutional Research and Planning, a central service division that provides guidance and data analytic support to senior leaders, and advised in the creation of the campus Veterans Center, one part of a larger diversity initiative that affords veteran students a gathering place. The university has since been officially designated a Military Friendly campus.

==Campus==
The university originally housed students in buildings that now surround the alumni quad.

===Campus buildings===

*'''Hammond Hall''' contains the Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library, the Information Desk, the Game Room, the Falcon Hub (formerly The Underground Pub), the Follet Bookstore, the Campus Center Cafe, and the North Street Bistro (which includes BYOB, 2Mato, Subway, and Freshens). The third floor houses the student services center which includes the tutor center, math center, writing center, disability services, and counseling services, among others.

*'''Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library''' is the main library on campus with over 1 million books, rolls of [[microfiche]], journals, and periodicals, on four floors. It has an extensive collection of children's and young adults books. The Library holds many special collections from notable alumni, faculty, and local residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/library/archives/index.cfm Amelia V. Gallucci-Cirio Library: Archives &amp; Special Collections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031140617/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/library/archives/index.cfm |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These special collections include works from [[Robert Cormier]], well-known author for young adults, and [[R. A. Salvatore]], a prolific fantasy writer, well known for his ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' novels and ''[[The DemonWars Saga]]''. There are works by Richard Kent, former music teacher for whom Kent Recital Hall was named, Ernst Fandreyer's translation of Gauss' proof, works by William Wolkovich-Valkavicius, as well as papers by John Ellis Van Courtland Moon, former professor of history.

* '''Thompson Hall''', built in 1896, was the University's original building. It is now primarily a classroom building. It is home to the Nursing Department and its laboratories, including a 10-bed mock hospital which is fully equipped to be used in case of an emergency on campus. When the Hammond Campus Center was built, a tunnel that ran to the former Palmer House dormitory was made into a thoroughfare between the second level of the new building and the basement of Thompson Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/facilities/thompson/thompfloorb.cfm Capital Planning &amp; Maintenance - Thompson Hall - Basement Floor Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194232/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/facilities/thompson/thompfloorb.cfm |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Percival Hall.JPG|thumb|left|Percival Hall]]

* '''Edgerly Hall''' was first used as "an eighth-grade model and practice school," which made it one of the first [[junior high schools]] in America. It is now home to the [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]] departments, plus computer labs and classrooms.
* '''Percival Hall''' is directly across the Quad from Edgerly and is the home of the Behavioral Science department, including [[Psychology]], [[Sociology]], and [[Criminal Justice]]  It also houses Percival Auditorium, which seats 400, and classrooms.
* '''Miller Hall''' sits near Percival Hall and Thompson Hall, and houses offices for the [[English language|English]] and [[History]] departments.
* The '''Anthony Student Service Center''' is the student service center on campus, hosting offices for Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Accounts, Graduate and Continuing Education, Registrar, and the OneCard office.
* The '''Dupont Facilities Building''' houses the schools maintenance department.
* The '''Antonucci Science Complex''' houses science classrooms, laboratories and departmental offices, as well as a 90-seat lecture hall.  In 2013, construction of a new "state of the art" 54,700 square foot Science Center Lab Wing was completed, which houses teaching and research laboratory space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbtarchitects.com/architecture/academic/science/index.php?id=201 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701232841/http://www.cbtarchitects.com/architecture/academic/science/index.php?id=201 |archive-date=2015-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, a full renovation of the pre-existing Condike Science Building was completed.  The Antonucci Science Complex currently houses the Department of Geo/Physical Sciences and the Department of Biology and Chemistry.
* The '''Conlon Arts Building''' is actually two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway. One building is home to the large [[Communication studies|communications]]/media and [[industrial arts|industrial technology]] departments and home to the school's [[Information Technology]] office. This section of the building includes large video and film production resources, a large photography and graphic arts department, and metal, wood, and theatrical scene shops. The other part contains a 280-seat lecture hall, the offices of the fine arts faculty, as well as art/music studios and classrooms.

===Residence halls===
The campus has six residence halls, three of which have rooms in suites, two are designated as apartment-style living, and one has a normal dormitory layout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualtour.fsc.edu Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024152303/http://virtualtour.fsc.edu/ |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/ Fitchburg State College - Housing and Residential Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194456/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/ |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fitchburg State Townhouses.JPG|thumb|left|The Townhouse Apartments]]

Aubuchon Hall, Mara Village, and Russell Towers are the three suite halls. Each suite has a common living room area, four to six rooms, and a bathroom. Aubuchon Hall and Mara Village have "locked off" suites: A key is needed to get into the suites.  Aubuchon is home to the office of Housing and Residential Services, which is located on the first floor. Russell is home to the Student Health Service, which provides students with two nurse practitioners and a physician during the week.  Recently, the Campus Mail Center moved to the bottom floor of the Mara Village Commons Building located within the Mara complex.

There are two apartment-style residence halls on campus: the Townhouse Apartments and the North Street Apartments. Because of their layout, both of these halls are usually reserved for upperclassmen. Each one of the 33 Townhouses is equipped with a combination living room/kitchen area, one-and-a-half baths, and individual bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/housingcost.html Housing and Residential Services - Housing Process - Housing Costs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194716/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campusliving/housingcost.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Street Apartment building was acquired in the summer of 2007 and consists of six apartments. Each apartment has five single bedrooms, a full bathroom and a half bathroom, a kitchen and a living room area.

Herlihy Hall is the smallest and oldest, of the University's current residence halls but has the largest rooms. It houses 150 students in a normal dormitory style (one long corridor with rooms off it), and has the luxury of being connected to the dining commons.
[[File:Russell Towers.JPG|thumb|Russell Towers]]

Mara Village was recently expanded and opened for the fall 2009 semester. The $12 million expansion added 125 beds and allows 50% of the undergraduate population to live on campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc-alumni.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=99999999&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus has also adopted Cedar Street Home as a residence hall. Previously, this building from 1900 was a nursing home. The university bought it in 2005 and to rent the single rooms to girls from sororities. However, in the 2012-2013 academic year the Cedar Street Home became co-ed, and no longer affiliated with sororities specifically.

===Dining facilities===
Holmes Dining Commons, known as the Dining Hall, is the main dining facility on campus. It spans North Street, the main road through campus, and lets foot traffic easily move from one side of the street to the other. It is run by the [[foodservice]] Chartwells and is [[buffet]] style. In the summer of 2006, it had a $4 million renovation.

Chartwells also offers a food court style eating place in the North Street Bistro, located on the street level of the Hammond Campus Center.  Food options at the NSB include BYOB, Create, Cafe, Freshens and Subway.  Students are able to pay with their falcon dollars which are included within their meal plan. Outside guests are welcome.

===Transportation===
Transportation around Fitchburg State University's campus is usually accomplished through walking. Also, there is a [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority|shuttle bus (Fitchburg/Leominster Fixed Route, Route 4)]] that goes from the [[Wallace Civic Center]], through campus, and then to the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop. The loop takes about 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campuspolice/shuttlebus.html Campus Police - Shuttle Bus Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719194735/http://www.fitchburgstate.edu/campuspolice/shuttlebus.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop closest to the University is the [[Fitchburg (MBTA station)|Fitchburg]] stop on the [[Fitchburg Line]]. The line ends at [[North Station]] and is about an hour and a half ride. It is [[wheelchair accessible]] and a short walk from campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=FITCHBRG MBTA schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

On and off campus transportation is a collaboration between the Fitchburg State University and the [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority]]. Faculty, staff, and students can ride any of the [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority|Fitchburg/Leominster Fixed-Routes Buses]] free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120425132247/http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=488 Fitchburg State College - Public Relations - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9954">'''Frame analysis''' (also called '''framing analysis''') is a [[multi-disciplinary]] [[social science]] research method used to analyze how people understand situations and activities. The concept is generally attributed to the work of [[Erving Goffman]] and his 1974 book ''Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience'' and has been developed in [[social movement]] theory, [[policy studies]] and elsewhere.

Framing theory and frame analysis is a broad theoretical approach that has been used in [[communication studies]], news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements among other applications. "Framing is the process by which a communication source, such as a news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy" (Nelson, Oxley, &amp; Clawson, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;221).

==As rhetorical criticism==
Frame analysis had been proposed as a type of rhetorical analysis for political actors in the 1980s.  Political communication researcher [[Jim A. Kuypers]] first published his work advancing framing analysis as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event), and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers' work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that "induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information. ..."&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, '' Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action '', Lexington Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective" Kuypers details the differences between framing analysis as rhetorical criticism and as a social scientific endeavor, in particular arguing that framing criticism offers insights unavailable to social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;
Jim A. Kuypers, "Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective", P. D'Angelo and J. A. Kuypers, eds., ''Doing News Framing Analysis,'' Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 work, ''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;ref&gt;
''Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action''&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers offers a detailed template for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, "Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea."&lt;ref&gt;Jim A. Kuypers, ''Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age'' , Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers' work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view.

==For social movements==
Framing has been utilized to explain the process of social movements (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A. and Robert D. Benford (1988). "Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization". Pp. 197-217 in Bert Klandermans, Hanspeter Kriesi, and Sidney Tarrow (eds.), From Structure to Action: Social Movement Participation Across Cultures. Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, they are part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow &amp; Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. This is a process known as ''frame alignment''.

==Frame alignment—a process to explain social movement theory==
Snow and Benford (1988) say that frame alignment is an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, that "frame alignment" occurs (p.&amp;nbsp;198; Snow et al. 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;464&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A., R. Burke Rochford, Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert D. Benford. 1986. "Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation." American Sociological Review 51: 464-481.&lt;/ref&gt;), producing "frame resonance", which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts are successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts are:
* "The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort". Snow and Benford (1988) identify three core framing tasks and the degree to which these tasks are attended to will determine participant mobilization. The three tasks are: 
:# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame;
:# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem; and
:# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action.
* The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief system; centrality – the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness – if the frame is linked to only one core belief or value that, in itself, is of limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted.
* Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must be relevant to participants and inform them. Relevancy can be constrained by empirical credibility or testability, it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, that is, it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations.
* Cycles of protest (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Framing efforts may be affected by previous frames.

Snow and Benford (1988) propose that once proper frames are constructed as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame alignment.

==For political thought==
Frame analysis for political thought has been dominated by two popular cognitive scientists: [[George Lakoff]], nurturant parent governance; and [[Frank Luntz]], strict father governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Watts, co-founder, Empathy Surplus Project, http://empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four types of frame alignment==
There are four types, which include frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.

# '''Frame bridging''' is the "linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;467). It involves the linkage of a movement to "unmobilized sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters" (p.&amp;nbsp;467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base.
#'''Frame amplification''' refers to "the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs.
# '''Frame extensions''' are a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups. (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;469)
#'''Frame transformation''' is a process required when the proposed frames "may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;473). When this happens, new values, new meanings and understandings are required in order to secure participants and support. Goffman (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;43–44) calls this "keying" where "activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework transpose in terms of another framework" (Snow et al., 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;474) such that they are seen differently. There are two types of frame transformation:
## '''Domain-specific transformations''' such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and
## '''Global interpretive frame transformation''' where the scope of change is quite radical as in a change of world views, total conversions of thought, or uprooting of all that is familiar (e.g. moving from [[communism]] to [[market capitalism]]; religious conversion, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8620">'''GPS/INS''' is the use of [[GPS]] satellite signals to correct or calibrate a solution from an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS). The method is applicable for any GNSS/INS system.

== Overview ==
=== Problem ===
Inertial navigation systems usually can provide an accurate solution only for a short period of time. The INS accelerometers produce an unknown bias signal that appears as a genuine specific force. This is acceleration integrated twice against time and thus produces an error in position. Additionally, the INS software must use an estimate of the angular position of the accelerometers when conducting this integration. Typically, the angular position is tracked through an integration of the angular rate from the gyro sensors. These also produce unknown biases that affect the integration to get the position of the unit. 

=== GPS/INS method ===
The GPS gives an absolute drift-free position value that can be used to reset the INS solution or can be blended with it by use of a mathematical algorithm, such as a [[Kalman filter]]. The angular orientation of the unit can be inferred from the series of position updates from the GPS. The change in the error in position relative to the GPS can be used to estimate the unknown angle error.

The benefits of using GPS with an INS are that the INS may be calibrated by the GPS signals and that the INS can provide position and angle updates at a quicker rate than GPS. For high dynamic vehicles, such as missiles and aircraft, INS fills in the gaps between GPS positions. Additionally, GPS may lose its signal and the INS can continue to compute the position and angle during the period of lost GPS signal. The two systems are complementary and are often employed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=M. S.|title=Global Positioning, Inertial Navigation &amp; Integration|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|author2=L. R. Weill |author3=A. P. Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
GPS/INS is commonly used on aircraft for navigation purposes. Using GPS/INS allows for smoother position and velocity estimates that can be provided at a sampling rate faster than the GPS receiver.  This also allows for accurate estimation of the aircraft attitude (roll, pitch, and yaw) {{citation needed|reason=GPS wont provide attitude that easily, only position/velocity|date=May 2016}} angles.  In general, GPS/INS sensor fusion is a nonlinear filtering problem, which is commonly approached using the [[extended Kalman filter]] (EKF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalman|first=R. E.|author2=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41098">'''Granular computing''' (GrC) is an emerging [[computing]] paradigm of [[information processing]] that concerns the processing of complex information entities called "information [[granulation|granules]]", which arise in the process of data abstraction and [[knowledge extraction|derivation of knowledge]] from information or data.  Generally speaking, information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their [[Similarity measure|similarity]], functional or physical adjacency, indistinguishability, coherency, or the like.

At present, granular computing is more a ''theoretical perspective'' than a coherent set of methods or principles.  As a theoretical perspective, it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales.  In this sense, it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented.

== Types of granulation ==
[[File:Catarina 26 mar 2004 1310Z.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of cyclone.]] 
[[File:NASA Manhattan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of Manhattan.]] 
As mentioned above, ''granular computing'' is not an algorithm or process; there is no particular method that is called "granular computing".  It is rather an approach  to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity, much as different features become salient in [[satellite images]] of greater or lesser resolution.  On a low-resolution satellite image, for example, one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing [[cyclones]] or other large-scale weather phenomena, while in a higher-resolution image, one misses these large-scale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smaller-scale phenomena, such as the interesting pattern that is the streets of [[Manhattan]].  The same is generally true of all data: At different resolutions or granularities, different features and relationships emerge.  The aim of granular computing is to try to take advantage of this fact in designing more effective machine-learning and reasoning systems.

There are several types of granularity that are often encountered in [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]], and we review them below:

=== Value granulation (discretization/quantization) ===
One type of granulation is the [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of variables.  It is very common that in data mining or machine-learning applications the resolution of variables needs to be ''decreased'' in order to extract meaningful regularities.  An example of this would be a variable such as "outside temperature" (&lt;math&gt;temp&lt;/math&gt;), which in a given application might be recorded to several decimal places of [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] (depending on the sensing apparatus).  However, for purposes of extracting relationships between "outside temperature" and, say, "number of health-club applications" (&lt;math&gt;club &lt;/math&gt;), it will generally be advantageous to quantize "outside temperature" into a smaller number of intervals.

==== Motivations ====
There are several interrelated reasons for granulating variables in this fashion:
* Based on prior [[domain knowledge]], there is no expectation that minute variations in temperature (e.g., the difference between {{convert|80|-|80.7|°F|C|1}}) could have an influence on behaviors driving the number of health-club applications.  For this reason, any "regularity" which our learning algorithms might detect at this level of resolution would have to be ''spurious'', as an artifact of overfitting.  By coarsening the temperature variable into intervals the difference between which we ''do'' anticipate (based on prior domain knowledge) might influence  number of health-club applications, we eliminate the possibility of detecting these spurious  patterns.  Thus, in this case, reducing resolution is a method of controlling [[overfitting]].
* By reducing the number of intervals in the temperature variable (i.e., increasing its ''grain size''), we increase the amount of sample data indexed by each interval designation.  Thus, by coarsening the variable, we increase sample sizes and achieve better statistical estimation.  In this sense, increasing granularity provides an antidote to the so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]'', which relates to the exponential decrease in statistical power with increase in number of dimensions or variable cardinality.
*Independent of prior domain knowledge, it is often the case that meaningful regularities (i.e., which can be detected by a given learning methodology, representational language, etc.) may exist at one level of resolution and not at another.

[[File:Value granulation.png|thumb|200 px|Benefits of value granulation: Implications here exist at the resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{X_i,Y_j\}&lt;/math&gt; that do not exist at the higher resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{x_i,y_j\}&lt;/math&gt;; in particular, &lt;math&gt;\forall x_i,y_j: x_i \not\to y_j&lt;/math&gt;, while at the same time, &lt;math&gt;\forall X_i \exists Y_j: X_i \leftrightarrow Y_j&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For example, a simple learner or pattern recognition system may seek to extract regularities satisfying a [[conditional probability]] threshold such as &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) \ge \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.  In the special case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, this recognition system is essentially detecting ''[[logical implication]]'' of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt; or, in words, "if &lt;math&gt;X=x_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;".  The system's ability to recognize such implications (or, in general, conditional probabilities exceeding threshold)  is partially contingent on the resolution with which the system analyzes the variables.

As an example of this last point, consider the feature space shown to the right.  The variables may each be regarded at two different resolutions.  Variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution wherein it takes on the four values &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or at a lower (binary) resolution wherein it takes on the two values &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution or at a lower (binary) resolution, where it takes on the values &lt;math&gt;\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{Y_1, Y_2\}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  It will be noted that at the high resolution, there are '''no''' detectable implications of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is associated with more than one &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt;, and thus, for all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  However, at the low (binary) variable resolution, two bilateral implications become detectable:    &lt;math&gt;X=X_1 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X=X_2 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_2 &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, a pattern recognition system scanning for implications of this kind would find them at the binary variable resolution, but would fail to find them at the   higher quaternary variable resolution.

====Issues and methods====
It is not feasible to exhaustively test all possible discretization resolutions on all variables in order to see which combination of resolutions yields interesting or significant results.  Instead, the feature space must be preprocessed (often by an [[information entropy|entropy]] analysis of some kind) so that some guidance can be given as to how the discretization process should proceed.  Moreover, one cannot generally achieve good results by naively analyzing and discretizing each variable independently, since this may obliterate the very interactions that we had hoped to discover.

A sample of papers that address the problem of variable discretization in general, and multiple-variable discretization in particular, is as follows: {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Wong|Cheung|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Bay|2001}},  {{Harvtxt|Liu|Hussain|Tan|Dasii|2002}}, {{Harvtxt|Wang|Liu|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Zighed|Rabaséda|Rakotomalala|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Catlett|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Dougherty|Kohavi|Sahami|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Monti|Cooper|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Fayyad|Irani|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Cheung|Wong|1990}}, {{Harvtxt|Nguyen|Nguyen|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Grzymala-Busse|Stefanowski|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Ting|1994}}, {{Harvtxt|Ludl|Widmer|2000}}, {{Harvtxt|Pfahringer|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|An|Cercone|1999}},

=== Variable granulation (clustering/aggregation/transformation) ===
Variable granulation is a term that could describe a variety of techniques, most of which are aimed at reducing dimensionality, redundancy, and storage requirements.  We briefly describe some of the ideas here, and present pointers to the literature.

====Variable transformation====
A number of classical methods, such as [[principal component analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]], [[factor analysis]], and [[structural equation modeling]], and their relatives, fall under the genus of "variable transformation."  Also in this category are more modern areas of study such as [[dimensionality reduction]], [[projection pursuit]], and [[independent component analysis]].  The common goal of these methods in general is to find a representation of the data in terms of new variables, which are a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original variables, and in which important statistical relationships emerge. The resulting variable sets are almost always smaller than the original variable set, and hence these methods can be loosely said to impose a granulation on the feature space.  These dimensionality reduction methods are all reviewed in the standard texts, such as {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005}}, and {{Harvtxt|Hastie|Tibshirani|Friedman|2001}}.

====Variable aggregation====
A different class of variable granulation methods derive more from [[data clustering]] methodologies than from the linear systems theory informing the above methods.  It was noted fairly early that one may consider "clustering" related variables in just  the same way that one considers clustering related data.  In data clustering, one identifies a group of similar entities (using a "[[measure of similarity]]" suitable to the domain — {{Harvtxt|Martino|Giuliani|Rizzi|2018}}), and then in some sense ''replaces'' those entities with a prototype of some kind.  The prototype may be the simple average of the data in the identified cluster, or some other representative measure.  But the key idea is that in subsequent operations, we may be able to use the single prototype for the data cluster (along with perhaps a statistical model describing how exemplars are derived from the prototype) to ''stand in'' for the much larger set of exemplars.   These prototypes are generally such as to capture most of the information of interest concerning the entities.

[[File:Kraskov tree.png|thumb|400 px|A Watanabe-Kraskov variable agglomeration tree. Variables are agglomerated (or "unitized") from the bottom-up, with each merge-node representing a (constructed) variable having entropy equal to the joint entropy of the agglomerating variables. Thus, the agglomeration of two m-ary variables &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; having individual entropies &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; yields a single &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;-ary variable &lt;math&gt;X_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; with entropy &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})=H(X_1,X_2)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are highly dependent (i.e., redundant) and have large mutual information &lt;math&gt;I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})&lt;/math&gt; &amp;#x226A; &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)+H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2)=H(X_1)+H(X_2)-I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and this would be considered a parsimonious unitization or aggregation.]]
Similarly, it is reasonable to ask whether a large set of variables might be aggregated into a smaller set of ''prototype'' variables that capture the most salient relationships between the variables.    Although variable clustering methods based on [[linear correlation]] have been proposed ({{Harvnb|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}};{{Harvnb|Rencher|2002}}), more powerful methods of variable clustering are based on the [[mutual information]] between variables. Watanabe has shown ({{Harvnb|Watanabe|1960}};{{Harvnb|Watanabe|1969}}) that for any set of variables one can construct a ''polytomic'' (i.e., n-ary) tree representing a series of variable agglomerations in which the ultimate "total" correlation  among the complete variable set is the sum of the "partial" correlations exhibited by each agglomerating subset (see figure). Watanabe suggests that an observer might seek to thus partition a system in such a way as to minimize the interdependence between the parts "... as if they were looking for a natural division or a hidden crack."

One practical approach to building such a tree is to successively choose for agglomeration the two variables (either atomic variables or previously agglomerated variables) which have the highest pairwise mutual information {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}. The product of each agglomeration is a new (constructed) variable that reflects the local [[joint distribution]] of the two agglomerating variables, and thus possesses an entropy equal to their [[joint entropy]].
(From a procedural standpoint, this agglomeration step involves replacing two columns in the attribute-value table—representing the two agglomerating variables—with a single column that has a unique value for every unique combination of values in the replaced columns {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}.  No information is lost by such an operation; however, it should be noted that if one is exploring the data for inter-variable relationships, it would generally ''not'' be desirable to merge redundant variables in this way, since in such a context it is likely to be precisely the redundancy or ''dependency'' between variables that is of interest;  and once redundant variables are merged, their relationship to one another can no longer be studied.

=== System granulation (aggregation) ===

In [[database systems]], aggregations (see e.g. [[OLAP|OLAP aggregation]] and [[Business intelligence]] systems) result in transforming original data tables (often called information systems) into the tables with different semantics of rows and columns, wherein the rows correspond to the groups (granules) of original tuples and the columns express aggregated information about original values within each of the groups. Such aggregations are usually based on SQL and its extensions. The resulting granules usually correspond to the groups of original tuples with the same values (or ranges) over some pre-selected original columns.

There are also other approaches wherein the groups are defined basing on, e.g., physical adjacency of rows. For example, [[Infobright]] implemented a database engine wherein data was partitioned onto ''rough rows'', each consisting of 64K of physically consecutive (or almost consecutive) rows. Rough rows were automatically labeled with compact information about their values on data columns, often involving multi-column and multi-table relationships. It resulted in a higher layer of granulated information where objects corresponded to rough rows and attributes - to various aspects of rough information. Database operations could be efficiently supported within such a new framework, with an access to the original data pieces still available {{Slezak|Synak|Wojna|Wroblewski|2013}}.

=== Concept granulation (component analysis) ===
The origins of the ''granular computing'' ideology are to be found in the [[rough sets]] and [[fuzzy sets]] literatures.  One of the key insights of rough set research—although by no means unique to it—is that, in general, the selection of different sets of features or variables will yield different ''concept'' granulations.  Here, as in elementary rough set theory, by "concept" we mean a set of entities that are ''indistinguishable'' or ''indiscernible'' to the observer (i.e., a simple concept), or a set of entities that is composed from such simple concepts (i.e., a complex concept).  To put it in other words, by projecting a data set ([[value-attribute system]]) onto different sets of variables, we recognize alternative sets of equivalence-class "concepts" in the data, and these different sets of concepts will in general be conducive to the extraction of different relationships and regularities.

====Equivalence class granulation====
We illustrate with an example.  Consider the attribute-value system below:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes or primitive (simple) concepts:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;,  cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes.  The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.  Now, let us imagine a projection of the attribute value system onto attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, which would represent, for example, the  view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute. Then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is in a certain regard the same structure as before, but at a lower degree of resolution (larger grain size).  Just as in the case of [[#Value granulation (discretization/quantization)|value granulation (discretization/quantization)]], it is possible that relationships (dependencies) may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another.  As an example of this, we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as ''attribute dependency'' (a simpler relative of the [[mutual information]]).

To establish this notion of dependency (see also [[rough sets]]), let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt; represent a particular concept granulation, where each &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, if the  attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, as above,  then the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; will be composed of    &lt;math&gt;Q_1 = \{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_2 = \{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q_3 = \{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''dependency''' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on another attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\left | \sum_{i=1}^N {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its "lower approximation" (see [[rough sets]]) by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  More simply, this approximation  is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which—based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;—can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by  attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects, in a sense capturing the "synchronization" of the two concept structures &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" (Ziarko &amp; Shan 1995).

Having gotten definitions now out of the way, we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity (i.e., choice of attributes) will influence the detected dependencies among attributes.  Consider again the attribute value table from above:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

Let us consider the dependency of attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;
on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{5},O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{6},O_{9}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{5},O_{9}\} \\
\{O_{8}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The objects that can be ''definitively'' categorized according to concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are those in the set &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{8},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and since there are six of these, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 6/10&lt;/math&gt;.  This might be considered an interesting dependency in its own right, but perhaps in a particular data mining application only stronger dependencies are desired.

We might then consider the dependency of the smaller attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
on the attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The move from &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt; induces a coarsening of the class structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, as will be seen shortly.  We wish again to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into the (now larger) classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of the new &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{5},O_{6},O_{8},O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{5},O_{9}\} \\
\{O_{8}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; has a coarser granularity than it did earlier.  The objects that can now be ''definitively'' categorized according to the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; constitute the complete universe &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},\ldots,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, knowledge of membership according to category set  &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; is adequate to determine category membership in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; with complete certainty; In this case we might say that &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, by coarsening the concept structure, we were able to find a stronger (deterministic) dependency.  However, we also note that the classes induced in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; from the reduction in resolution necessary to obtain this deterministic dependency are now themselves large and few in number; as a result, the dependency we found, while strong, may be less valuable to us than the weaker dependency found earlier under the higher resolution view of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

In general it is not possible to test all sets of attributes to see which induced concept structures yield the strongest dependencies, and this search must be therefore be guided with some intelligence.  Papers which discuss this issue, and others relating to intelligent use of granulation, are those by Y.Y. Yao and [[Lotfi Zadeh]] listed in the [[#References]] below.

====Component granulation====
Another perspective on concept granulation may be obtained from work on parametric models of categories.  In [[mixture model]] learning, for example, a set of data is explained as a mixture of distinct [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] (or other) distributions.  Thus, a large amount of data is "replaced" by a small number of distributions.  The choice of the number of these distributions, and their size, can again be viewed as a problem of ''concept granulation''.  In general, a better fit to the data is obtained by a larger number of distributions or parameters, but in order to extract meaningful patterns, it is necessary to constrain the number of distributions, thus deliberately  ''coarsening'' the concept resolution.  Finding the "right" concept resolution is a tricky problem for which many methods have been proposed (e.g., [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]], [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], [[Minimum description length|MDL]], etc.), and these are frequently  considered under the rubric of "[[model regularization]]".

==Different interpretations of granular computing==
Granular computing can be conceived as a framework of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules in the process of problem solving.  In this sense, granular computing is used as an umbrella term to cover topics that have been studied in various fields in isolation.  By examining all of these existing studies in light of the unified framework of granular computing and extracting their commonalities, it may be possible to develop a general theory for problem solving.

In a more philosophical sense, granular computing can describe a way of thinking that relies on the human ability to perceive the real world under various levels of granularity (i.e., abstraction) in order to abstract and consider only those things that serve a specific interest and to switch among different granularities. By focusing on different levels of granularity, one can obtain different levels of knowledge, as well as a greater understanding of the inherent knowledge structure.  Granular computing is thus essential in human problem solving and hence has a very significant impact on the design and implementation of intelligent systems.

'''Guido of Arezzo''' (also '''Guido Aretinus''', '''Guido Aretino''', '''Guido da Arezzo''', '''Guido Monaco''', '''Guido d'Arezzo''', or '''Guy of Arezzo''' also '''Guy d'Arezzo''') (991/992 – after 1033) was an Italian music theorist of the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern [[musical notation#Early Europe|musical notation]] ([[Staff (music)|staff notation]]) that replaced [[neume|neumatic notation]]. His text, the ''[[Micrologus]]'', was the second most widely distributed treatise on music in the Middle Ages (after the writings of [[Boethius]]).

==Life==
Guido was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] from the Italian city-state of [[Arezzo]]. Recent research has dated his ''Micrologus'' to 1025 or 1026; since Guido stated in a letter that he was thirty-four when he wrote it,&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi"&gt;Stuart Lyons, ''Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi with Full Verse Translation of the Odes''. Oxford: Aris &amp; Phillips, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-85668-790-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his birthdate is presumed to be around 991 or 992. His early career was spent at the [[Pomposa Abbey|monastery of Pomposa]], on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast near [[Ferrara]]. While there, he noted the difficulty that singers had in remembering [[Gregorian chant]]s.

He came up with a method for teaching the singers to learn chants in a short time, and quickly became famous throughout north Italy. However, he attracted the hostility of the other monks at the abbey, prompting him to move to Arezzo, a town which had no abbey, but which did have a large group of cathedral singers, whose training [[Tedald (Bishop of Arezzo)|Bishop Tedald]] invited him to conduct.

While at Arezzo, he developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the "ut–re–mi–fa–so–la" ([[Solfège|do–re–mi–fa–so–la]]) [[mnemonic]] ([[solmization]]). The ut–re–mi-fa-so-la syllables are taken from the initial syllables of each of the first six half-lines of the first stanza of the [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', whose text is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] (though the musical line either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of [[Horace]]'s "[[:la:s:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|Ode to Phyllis]]" (''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' 4.11), recorded in the Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from it).&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi" /&gt;  [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] is known for having changed the name of note "Ut" (C), renaming it "Do" (in the "Do Re Mi ..." sequence known as [[solfège]]).&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh note, "Si" (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes," Latin for St. John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale.&lt;ref&gt; Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 271–7). {{ISBN|978-0-19-520912-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-19-820171-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In anglophone countries, "Si" was changed to "Ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]] (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] and in the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]".

The ''Micrologus'', written at the cathedral at Arezzo and dedicated to Tedald, contains Guido's teaching method as it had developed by that time. Soon it had attracted the attention of [[Pope John XIX]], who invited Guido to Rome. Most likely he went there in 1028, but he soon returned to Arezzo, due to his poor health. It was then that he announced in a letter to Michael of Pomposa ("{{Lang|la|Epistola de ignoto cantu|italic=no}}") his discovery of the "ut–re–mi" musical mnemonic. Little is known of him after this time.

==The Guidonian hand==
Guido is credited with the invention of the [[Guidonian hand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11968 Claude V. Palisca and Dolores Pesce: "Guido of Arezzo [Aretinus&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"]. ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', 11 February 2013. Accessed 11 February 2018. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26154 "Solmization"] by Andrew Hughes and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. However, only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft [[hexachord]]s cannot be securely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Theory, Theorists, §5: Early Middle Ages", ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner had arisen. Guido of Arezzo's alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed for musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]] (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Bonnie Blackburn certainly does not make this outrageous claim. Who in the modern era confuses a six-note system with a twenty-note one?}} Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie J. Blackburn, "[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17205 Lusitano, Vicente]", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Michael Randel]], "Guido of Arezzo", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1996): 339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A monument to him was erected in his native Arezzo. He is one of the famous Tuscans honored by a statue in the [[Loggiato of the Uffizi]] in Florence. 

The [[Scorewriter|computer music notation]] system [[GUIDO music notation]] is named after him and his invention.

The "International Guido d'Arezzo Polyphonic Contest" (Concorso Polifónico Guido d'Arezzo) is named after him.

[[Francisco Valls]]' controversial ''Missa Scala Aretina'' took its name from Guido Aretinus' scale.

'''Hydrology''' (from Greek: [[wikt:ὕδωρ|ὕδωρ]], "hýdōr" meaning "water"; and [[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]], "lógos" meaning "study") is the scientific study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water on Earth and other planets, including the [[water cycle]], [[water resources]] and environmental watershed sustainability. A practitioner of hydrology is a '''hydrologist''', working within the fields of [[earth science|earth]] or [[environmental science]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]] or [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]].&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web

Hydrology subdivides into surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology), and marine hydrology. Domains of hydrology include [[hydrometeorology]], [[surface-water hydrology|surface hydrology]], [[hydrogeology]],  [[drainage basin|drainage-basin]] management and [[water quality]], where water plays the central role.

[[Oceanography]] and [[meteorology]] are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields.

Hydrological research can inform environmental engineering, [[environmental policy|policy]] and [[environmental planning|planning]].

== History ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=April 2012}}
Hydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia. For example, about 4000 BC the Nile was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands. [[Mesopotamia]]n towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueducts]] were built by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans]], while the [[history of China]] shows they built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in [[Sri Lanka]], also known for invention of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, [[anicut]]s and canals which still function.

[[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius]], in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} With adoption of a more scientific approach, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Bernard Palissy]] independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.

Pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Edmund Halley]]. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine. Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Advances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli [[piezometer]] and [[Bernoulli's equation]], by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and the [[Pitot tube]], by [[Henri Pitot]]. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including [[Darcy's law]], the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-[[Poiseuille]]'s capillary flow equation.

Rational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman's [[unit hydrograph]], the infiltration theory of [[Robert E. Horton]], and C.V. Theis's aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics.

Since the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). (See also [[GIS and hydrology]])

== Themes ==
{{Main|Water cycle}}
The central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the [[Earth]] through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.

The areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making prediction in practical applications.

=== Groundwater ===
[[File:Building a map of groundwater countours.gif|thumb|250px|right|Building a map of groundwater contours]]
Ground water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt; Groundwater hydrology ([[hydrogeology]]) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graf|first1=T.|last2=Simmons|first2=C. T.|title=Variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured rock: Applicability of the Tang et al. [1981] analytical solution|journal=Water Resources Research|date=February 2009|volume=45|issue=2|page=W02425|doi=10.1029/2008WR007278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: [[aquifer test]]). Measurements here can be made using a [[piezometer]]. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods&lt;ref name=Vereecken /&gt; for characterising aquifers. There are also problems in characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

=== Infiltration ===
{{Main|Infiltration (hydrology)}}
Infiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, and the rest [[Percolation|percolates]] down to the [[water table]]. The infiltration capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force ([[hydraulic head]]). Dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by [[capillary action]]; this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet. [[Compaction (geology)|Compaction]] reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other processes. Higher temperatures reduce [[viscosity]], increasing infiltration.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddy|first1=P. Jaya Rami|title=A textbook of hydrology|date=2007|publisher=Laxmi Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170080992|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250–275}}

=== Soil moisture ===
[[Soil moisture]] can be measured in various ways; by [[capacitance probe]], [[time domain reflectometer]] or [[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]. Other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods.

=== Surface water flow ===
Hydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport, although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring flow once water has reached a river include the [[stream gauge]] (see: [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]), and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water, sediment transport and erosion.

One of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels.

=== Precipitation and evaporation ===
In some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured in various ways: [[disdrometer]] for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale; [[radar]] for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow detection; [[rain gauge]] for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall; [[satellite]] for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-use, and soil moisture, for example.

[[Evaporation]] is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a [[sling psychrometer]]. It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpiration
from plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's [[evaporation pan]].

Detailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum, heat flux and energy budgets.

=== Remote sensing ===
[[Remote sensing]] of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations where ''in situ'' sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the terrestrial water balance, for example [[surface water]] storage, [[soil moisture]], [[precipitation]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[snow]] and [[ice]], are measurable using remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Q.|last2=Gao|first2=H.|last3=Lu|first3=H.|last4=Lettenmaier|first4=D. P.|title=Remote sensing: hydrology|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|date=6 October 2009|volume=33|issue=4|pages=490–509|doi=10.1177/0309133309346650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and [[Earth observation satellite|satellite sensors]] which can capture [[Passive microwave sensor|microwave]], [[near-infrared|thermal and near-infrared]] data or use [[lidar]], for example.

=== Water quality ===
{{Main|Water quality}}

In hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds, and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]].

=== Integrating measurement and modelling ===
* Budget analyses
* Parameter estimation
* Scaling in time and space
* [[Data assimilation]]
* Quality control of data – see for example [[Double mass analysis]]

=== Prediction ===
Observations of hydrologic processes are used to make [[predictions]] of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is "Prediction in Ungauged Basins" (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.

=== Statistical hydrology ===
By analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are made in terms of the [[return period]] of such events. Other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.

These estimates are important for [[engineers]] and economists so that proper [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural, industrial and [[residential]] demands.

=== Modeling ===
{{main|Hydrological modelling}}
Hydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of [[scientific modeling]]. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* Models based on data. These models are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, and [[system identification]]. The simplest of these models may be linear models, but it is common to deploy non-linear components to represent some general aspects of a catchment's response without going deeply into the real physical processes involved. An example of such an aspect is the well-known behavior that a catchment will respond much more quickly and strongly when it is already wet than when it is dry..
* Models based on process descriptions. These models try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of [[surface runoff]], [[subsurface flow]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[open channel flow|channel flow]], but they can be far more complicated. These models are known as deterministic hydrology models. Deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models.

Recent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the [[behavioral modeling in hydrology|behavior of hydrologic systems]] to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Hydrologic transport model}}
Water movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil, gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a [[point source (pollution)|point source]] discharge or a [[line source]] or [[Area source (pollution)|area source]], such as [[surface runoff]]. Since the 1960s rather complex [[mathematical model]]s have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[total dissolved solids]] and [[sediment]].

The '''''ISTTOK Tokamak''''' ("Instituto Superior Técnico TOKamak") is a research [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactor ([[tokamak]]) of the [[Instituto Superior Técnico]]. It has a circular cross-section due to a poloidal graphite limiter and an iron core transformer. Its particularity is that it is one of the few tokamaks operating in AC (alternating plasma current) regime, as well in DC regime. In 2013, the AC operation allowed the standard discharges to extend from 35 ms to more than 1s.

== Characteristics ==
* Minor radius: 0.085 metre
* Major radius: 0.46 metre
* Plasma current: ~7kA kiloAmperes
* Plasma life span: 30/1000 milliseconds (DC/AC)
* Maximum toroidal magnetic field: 2.8 Tesla
* Nominal toroidal magnetic field: 0.3-0.6 Tesla

[[File:Itztalbruecke_2005-07-24.jpg|right|thumb|Incrementally-launched bridge construction [[Itz]] [[:de:Itztalbrücke (A73)|Valley Bridge]] near [[Coburg]]]]
'''Incremental launch''' is a method of building a complete bridge deck from one end of the bridge only.

==History==
The first incrementally-launched bridge was the 96 metre span [[Caroní River Bridge]], a [[box girder bridge]] over the [[Caroní River]] in 1964. 

The normal method of building [[concrete bridge]]s is the segmental method, one span at a time.

==Method==
The bridges are mostly of the box girder design and work with straight or [[Constant curvature|constant curve]] shapes, with a constant radius. 15 to 30 metre box girder sections of the [[Deck (bridge)|bridge deck]] are fabricated at one end of the bridge in factory conditions. Each section is manufactured in around one week.

The first section of the launch is not made of concrete, but is a [[Stiffening|stiffened]] steel [[Plate girder bridge|plate girder]] and is around 60% of the length of a bridge span, and reduces the [[cantilever]] moment.

The sections of bridge deck slide over sliding bearings, which are concrete blocks covered with [[stainless steel]] and reinforced [[Elastomer|elastomeric pad]]s.

'''India Pride Project''' ('''IPP''') is a group of art enthusiasts who uses social media to identify stolen religious artefacts from Indian temples and secure their return. Co-founded in 2014 by two Singapore-based art enthusiasts, S. Vijay Kumar and Anuraag Saxena, it now has activists from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anuraag Saxena: Returning stolen art to India|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq6b07Ln0Pc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook sleuths bring home India's stolen idols|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/life-culture/facebook-sleuths-bring-home-indias-stolen-idols|website=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=S Vijay|last=Kumar|title=India Pride Project - How Smuggled Indian Art Is Brought Back Home|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/how-smuggled-indian-art-brought-home|website=swarajyamag.com|accessdate=2017-01-05|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nirmala|last=Ganapathy|title=Recovering India's stolen art pieces|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/recovering-indias-stolen-art-pieces|website=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=11 November 2018|date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recoveries==

'''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]''': In 2014, it helped to secure the return of a US$5 million bronze statue of the Hindu god Shiva from the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Named ''[[Sripuranthan Natarajan Idol|Dancing Shiva]]'', the statue was stolen from a Tamil Nadu temple and trafficked by [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], a former Manhattan art dealer who was later under the United States federal investigation known as Operation Hidden Idol. When the gallery denied the statue was stolen, IPP used the social media to publicize and compare the images of the stolen idol with the one on gallery's display. Since the arrest of Kapoor in 2012, United States has returned to India many artefacts recovered under Operation Hidden Idol.

Ms Donna Yates, a lecturer on antiquities trafficking at the [[University of Glasgow]], believes "the grassroots work of the IPP in documenting cases of theft and bringing them to public attention is crucial - and unmatched anywhere in the world."

'''[[Nalanda]]'s 12th century Buddha''': This  six-and-a-half-inch bronze (with traces of silver inlay) of the Buddha seated in the bhumisparsha mudra,  was stolen along with  13 other  statues  1961 from the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) site museum in Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Politics/CQMHtZkX51woQKhGLHlmEO/On-Independence-Day-India-gets-back-its-12th-century-stolen.html On Independence Day, India gets back its 12th century stolen Buddha statue, Aditi Khanna, PTI, LiveMint, Aug 15 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was noticed at a at a London auction. Fortunately a photographic record of the statue was saved by Sachindra S. Biswas, a retired director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Kumar, is attempting  to pursue India’s claim on another Buddha statue, suspected to be from the 1961 theft, currently  at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/MitejLdBdImh1v8DIM3VWN/How-the-mystery-of-the-Missing-Buddha-statue-was-solved.html  How the mystery of the Missing Buddha statue was solved, Bibek Bhattacharya, Aug 21 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''induction''' in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] is an explanatory scene, summary or other text  that stands outside and apart from the main action with the intent to comment on it, moralize about it or in the case of [[dumb show]] to summarize the plot or underscore what is afoot. Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the [[Renaissance]] period, including those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and the address to the audience by Puck in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. Another example, in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by [[Thomas Kyd]], is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.

'''Joan Mabel Frederica Du Plat Taylor''' (26 June 1906 – 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Du%20Plat%20Taylor_Joan.pdf | format = PDF | title = Biographical essay on Joan Du Plat Taylor | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 26 June 1906 and, despite no formal training, became one of the first [[maritime archaeology|maritime archaeologists]].

Her parents were Colonel St. John Louis Hyde du Plat Taylor and Alice Home-Purves and her grandfather was Colonel [[John Lowther du Plat Taylor]] CB VD (1829 – 5 March 1904).  
 
She campaigned to bring [[nautical archaeology]] into the academic fold. She was instrumental in establishing the [[Nautical Archaeology Society#Council for Nautical Archaeology|Council for Nautical Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="IJNA 12 3 Obituary"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Obituary of Joan du Plat Taylor | journal = International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–189 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1983.tb00133.x | date = August 1983 | publisher = Academic Press, London | issn = 0305-7445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was founder editor of the [[Nautical Archaeology Society#International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]] (IJNA) from 1972–1980. She also recognised that amateurs could play an important role in archaeology and established systems to educate and encourage them. She was the first president of the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]].&lt;ref name="IJNA 10 4 Editorial"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morrison | first = Ian | title = Editorial | journal = International Journal of Nautical Archaeology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–2 | date = November 1981 | publisher = Academic Press, London | id = 0305-7445 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-9270.1981.tb00039.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She personally funded a grant to support publication of nautical archaeological research. Since her death, the award has continued to be given by the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]] as the ''Joan du Plat Taylor Award''.

As a trend "Land art" expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth including for instance the soil and rocks and vegetation and water found on-site, and the siting of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymodernmet.com/andy-goldsworthy-land-art/ http://mymodernmet.com] Unexpected Land Art Beautifully Formed in Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.land-arts.com/Land_art.html http://www.land-arts.com] Land art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet [[Earth]] as home to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;ArtSpeak, A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present, By Robert Atkins, Abbeville Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-78921-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micucci"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/04/land-art-earthworks-postwar-american-art/ Dana Micucci, ''Land Art: Earthworks that Defined Postwar American Art'', Art &amp; Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s land art protested "ruthless commercialization" of art in [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XAn5hztDTggC|publisher = PediaPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exponents of land art rejected the [[museum]] or [[Art museum|gallery]] as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable [[sculpture]] and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal art]] and [[conceptual art]] but also by modern movements such as [[De Stijl]], [[Cubism]], [[minimalism]] and the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and [[conceptual art]]. [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s 1941 design for ''Contoured Playground'' in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work "land art" but simply "sculpture". His influence on contemporary land art, [[landscape architecture]] and [[environmental sculpture]] is evident in many works today.&lt;ref name="Weilacher"&gt;Udo Weilacher, ''Between Landscape Architecture and Land Art''. Birkhäuser, 1999, Basel Berlin Boston 1999 {{ISBN|3-7643-6119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sonfist]] used an alternative approach to working with [[nature]] and [[culture]] by bringing historical nature and [[sustainable art]] back into New York City. His most inspirational work is ''Time Landscape'', an indigenous forest he planted in New York City.&lt;ref name="Weilacher" /&gt; He also created several other ''Time Landscapes'' around the world such as ''Circles of Time'' in Florence Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and recently at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic [[Barbara Rose]], writing in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. In 1967, the [[art critic]] Grace Glueck writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared the first earthwork was done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[women's liberation]] [[Social movement|movement]]s.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery &lt;!--"Dwan" is not a typo--&gt; in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/earthworks.html|title=Leftmatrix|publisher=leftmatrix.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1969, [[Willoughby Sharp]] curated the "Earth Art" exhibition at the [[Andrew Dickson White House|Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The artists included were [[Walter De Maria]], [[Jan Dibbets]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Neil Jenney]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Medalla]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Gunther Uecker]]. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in "Earth Art" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was the [[United States|American]] [[Robert Smithson]] whose 1968 essay "The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects" provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of [[Modernism]] from social issues as represented by the critic [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22land+art%22,+%22Clement+Greenberg%22,+smithson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP-sP09dPUAhXFKFAKHdrfB9oQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20art%22%2C%20%22Clement%20Greenberg%22%2C%20smithson&amp;f=false Francis Frascina, ''Art, Politics and Dissent: Aspects of the Art Left in Sixties America''], Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 142, {{ISBN|0719044693}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and [[algae]] so as to form a long (1500&amp;nbsp;ft) spiral-shape [[jetty]] protruding into [[Great Salt Lake]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States|U.S.]]. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water.

Utah Museum of Fine Arts. umfa.utah.org. July&amp;nbsp;30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's ''Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust'' (1968) is an example of land art existing in a [[art gallery|gallery]] space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with [[minimalism]]. There is also a relationship to [[Arte Povera]] in the use of materials traditionally considered "unartistic" or "worthless". The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curator to promote Land Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obsart.blogspot.fr/2012/05/conceptual-art-arte-povera-land-art-it.html|title=Observatoire du Land Art|publisher=obsart.blogspot.fr|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Land Artists' have tended to be American,&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; with other prominent artists in this field including, [[Carl Andre]], [[Alice Aycock]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]], [[Charles Ross (artist)|Charles Ross]], [[Alan Sonfist]], and [[James Turrell]]. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct [[Roden Crater]] [[volcano]] in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and the Australian [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm|title=Monumental Land Art of the United States|publisher=daringdesigns.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973 [[Jacek Tylicki]] begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in [[textile|fabric]]) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208060629/http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-02-08|title=Common Errors|authors=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|publisher=Christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of '[[social sculpture]]' influenced 'Land art' and his '[[7000 Eichen]]' project of 1982 to plant 7000 Oak trees has many similarities to 'Land art' processes. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Rogers]]' “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107&amp;nbsp;ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Eduardo Sanguinetti, the Latino-American philosopher and land-artist, presented in 1979 his "Sculptures in Earth". They were placed in natural spaces, they became functional as plants and animals made their homes in that particular topos installed in the La Pampa desert. Later, they acquired the noise of codes capable of classifying smells and colours, and will complete the original idea of our artist, who was at that time absorbed by the countryside and its specular radiation...in his Land-Art Performance "Solum" (1987), in the zoomorphy of that horse that greatly seduce the audience of the [[Centro Cultural Recoleta]] (ex Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires). "Amarillo Total" the name of the horse, not only stopped the ecologic blow but also paraded the models who had been completely painted by our artist, their naked painted bodies put another body to painting, with artesan colours prepared with earth and plants pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989, "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pp. 86, 87 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sanguinetti's Essay "Alter Ego" (1986), he said: "Spontaneous Activity in Nature...In nature, there is a type of spontaneous activity. This concept does not exist in cultured man, and if it does remain in children, it is like a faint reminiscence of the primitive mind...Consequently I think that the survival of an awareness of the supernatural in nature, should, in all works of Land-Art, be the thing which "animates Everything".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti Eduardo 1984, "Alter Ego" pag. 53, 54 (Pentland, Edinburgh, First Published in 1986 in the English languaje translated from the Spanish in 1986) {{ISBN|9780946270170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prTwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;dq=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FbBUNXSI-610AGY44DoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw |title=Alter ego - Eduardo Sanguinetti - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy [[patron]]s and [[private foundation]]s to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic down turn of the mid-1970s funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973 the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the Star Axis project, which he began in 1971. Michael Heizer continues his work on [[City (artwork)|City]], and James Turrell continues to work on the [[Roden Crater]] project. In most respects, "land art" has become part of mainstream [[public art]] and in many cases the term "land art" is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the [[avant-garde]] works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent the much older land works, [[Stonehenge]], the [[Pyramids]], [[Mound Builders|Native American mounds]], the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines in Peru]], [[Carnac stones]] and [[List of burial mounds in the United States|Native American burial grounds]], and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.&lt;ref name="Micucci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;

In 1835, David Hoffman said that the legal bibliography of [[France]] and [[Germany]], especially in the separate treatises on various branches of the law, was, by that date, "extensive, exact and learned".

The '''McCarthy 91 function''' is a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]], defined by the [[computer scientist]] [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] as a test case for [[formal verification]] within [[computer science]].

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 M(M(n+11)), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The results of evaluating the function are given by ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;91 for all integer arguments ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;100, and ''M''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;10 for ''n'' &amp;gt; 100. Indeed, the result of M(101) is also 91 (101 - 10 = 91). All results of M(n) after n = 101 are continually increasing by 1, e.g. M(102) = 92, M(103) = 93.

==History==
The 91 function was introduced in papers published by [[Zohar Manna]], [[Amir Pnueli]] and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] in 1970.  These papers represented early developments towards the application of [[formal methods]] to [[formal verification|program verification]].  The 91 function was chosen for being nested-recursive (contrasted with [[single recursion]], such as defining &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; by means of &lt;math&gt;f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;).  The example was popularized by Manna's book, ''Mathematical Theory of Computation'' (1974). As the field of Formal Methods advanced, this example appeared repeatedly in the research literature.
In particular, it is viewed as a "challenge problem" for automated program verification.

It is easier to reason about [[tail recursion|tail-recursive]] control flow, this is an equivalent ([[extensionality|extensionally equal]]) definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mt(n)= Mtaux(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mtaux(n, c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\\
 Mtaux(n-10, c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0 \\
 Mtaux(n+11, c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ and } c \ne 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
As one of the examples used to demonstrate such reasoning, Manna's book includes a tail-recursive algorithm equivalent to the nested-recursive 91 function. Many of the papers that report an "automated verification" (or [[termination proof]]) of the 91 function only handle the tail-recursive version.

This is an equivalent [[mutual recursion|mutually]] tail-recursive definition:
:&lt;math&gt;Mmt(n)= Mmtaux(n,0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 Mmtaux2(n-10,c), &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n+11,c+1), &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Mmtaux2(n,c)=\begin{cases}
 n, &amp; \mbox{if }c = 0\mbox{ } \\
 Mmtaux(n,c-1), &amp; \mbox{if }c \ne 0\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
A formal derivation of the mutually tail-recursive version from the nested-recursive one was given in a 1980 article by [[Mitchell Wand]], based on the use of [[continuation]]s.

==Examples==
Example A:

 M(99) = M(M(110)) since 99 ≤ 100
       = M(100)    since 110 &gt; 100
       = M(M(111)) since 100 ≤ 100
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

Example B:

 M(87) = M(M(98))
       = M(M(M(109)))
       = M(M(99))
       = M(M(M(110)))
       = M(M(100))
       = M(M(M(111)))
       = M(M(101))
       = M(91)
       = M(M(102))
       = M(92)
       = M(M(103))
       = M(93)
    .... Pattern continues increasing till M(99), M(100) and M(101), exactly as we saw on the example A)
       = M(101)    since 111 &gt; 100
       = 91        since 101 &gt; 100

==Code==
Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (defun mc91 (n)
   (cond ((&lt;= n 100) (mc91 (mc91 (+ n 11))))
         (t (- n 10))))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
  mc91 n 
    | n &gt; 100   = n - 10
    | otherwise = mc91 $ mc91 $ n + 11
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let rec mc91 n =
    if n &gt; 100 then n - 10
    else mc91 (mc91 (n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[OCaml (programming language)|OCaml]]:

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
  let mc91 n =
    let rec aux n c =
      if c = 0 then n
      else if n &gt; 100 then aux (n - 10) (c - 1)
      else aux (n + 11) (c + 1)
    in
    aux n 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
 def mc91(n):
    if n &gt; 100:
        return n - 10
    else:
        return mc91(mc91(n + 11))
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the nested-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     if( n &gt; 100 ) {
         return n - 10;
     } else {
         return mc91(mc91(n+11));
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is an implementation of the tail-recursive algorithm in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int mc91(int n)
 {
     mc91taux(n, 1);
 }

 int mc91taux(int n, int c)
 {
     if( c != 0 ) {
         if( n &gt; 100 ) {
             return mc91taux(n - 10, c - 1);
         } else {
             return mc91taux(n + 11, c + 1);
         }
     } else {
         return n;
     }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Proof==
Here is a proof that the function is equivalent to non-recursive:
:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\begin{cases}
 n - 10, &amp; \mbox{if }n &gt; 100\mbox{ } \\
 91, &amp; \mbox{if }n \le 100\mbox{ }
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101,

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(n + 11 - 10), where n + 11 &gt;= 101 since n &gt;= 90
      = M(n + 1)

So ''M''(''n'') = 91 for 90 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; 101.

We can use this as a base case for [[Inductive proof|induction]] on blocks of 11 numbers, like so:

Assume that ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''a'' ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'' + 11.

Then, for any ''n'' such that ''a'' - 11 ≤ ''n'' &amp;lt; ''a'',

 M(n) = M(M(n + 11))
      = M(91), by hypothesis, since a ≤ n + 11 &lt; a + 11
      = 91, by the base case.

Now by induction ''M''(''n'') = 91 for any ''n'' in such a block. There are no holes between the blocks, so ''M''(''n'') = 91 for ''n'' &amp;lt; 101. We can also add ''n'' = 101 as a special case.

== Knuth's generalization ==

[[Donald Knuth]] generalized the 91 function to include additional parameters. [[John Cowles]] developed a formal proof that Knuth's generalized function was total, using the [[ACL2]] theorem prover.

It often carries the connotation that such residents are only opposing the development because it is close to them, and that they would tolerate or support it if it was built further away. The residents are often called '''Nimbys''', and their viewpoint is called '''Nimbyism'''.

The NIMBY concept may also be applied to people who advocate some proposal (e.g., budget cuts, tax increases, layoffs, immigration or energy conservation) but oppose implementing it in a way that might affect their lives or require any sacrifice on their part.

==Claimed rationale==
Developments likely to attract local objections include:

* Infrastructure development, such as new roads and [[motorway service areas]], [[light rail]] and [[rapid transit|metro]] lines, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, airports, [[power plant]]s, retail developments, sales of public assets, [[Electric power transmission|electrical transmission lines]], [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]], [[landfill]]s, [[sewage treatment|sewage outfalls]] and [[prison]]s;
* The extraction of mineral resources including ore, aggregates and hydrocarbons from [[mining|mines]], [[quarries]] and [[oil well]]s or [[gas well]]s, respectively;
* [[renewable energy]] generators, such as [[wind farm]]s and [[solar panel]]s;
* businesses trading in goods perceived as [[immoral]], such as [[pornographic film|adult video]], [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] [[liquor store|stores]], and [[medical cannabis|medical]] [[marijuana|cannabis]] [[dispensaries]];
* accommodations perceived as primarily benefitting disadvantaged people, such as [[subsidized housing]] for the [[poverty|financially disadvantaged]], [[supportive housing]] for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[halfway house]]s for drug addicts and [[criminal]]s, and [[homeless shelter]]s for those with [[homeless|no fixed address]];
* services catering to certain stigmatised groups (for example, [[addiction|injection drug users]]), such as [[methadone clinic]]s, [[syringe exchange programme]]s, [[drug detoxification]] facilities, [[supervised injection site]]; 
* large-scale developments of all kinds, such as [[big-box store]]s and housing [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s.

The claimed reasons against these developments vary, and some are given below.

* ''Increased traffic:''  More jobs, more housing or more stores correlates to increased traffic on local streets and greater demand for parking spots. Industrial facilities such as warehouses, factories, or [[landfill]]s often increase the volume of truck traffic.
* ''Harm to locally owned [[small business]]es:''  The development of a big box store may provide too much competition to a locally owned store; similarly, the construction of a new road may make the older road less travelled, leading to a loss of business for property owners. This can lead to excessive relocation costs, or to loss of respected local businesses.
* ''Loss of residential property value:''  Homes near an undesirable development may be less desirable for potential buyers. The lost revenue from property taxes may, or may not, be offset by increased revenue from the project.
* ''[[Environmental pollution]] of land, air, and water:''  Power plants, factories, chemical facilities, [[crematorium]]s, [[sewage treatment facilities]], airports, and similar projects may, or may be claimed to, contaminate the land, air, or water around them. Especially facilities assumed to smell might cause objections.
* ''[[Light pollution]]:''  Projects that operate at night, or that include security lighting (such as street lights in a parking lot), may be accused of causing light pollution.
* ''[[Noise pollution]]:''  In addition to the noise of traffic, a project may inherently be noisy. This is a common objection to [[Windmill syndrome|wind power]], [[Mitigation of aviation's environmental impact#Methods of mitigating aviation's noise emissions|airports]], roads, and many industrial facilities, but also stadiums, [[music festival|festivals]], and [[nightclub]]s which are particularly noisy at night when locals want to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102034/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_nightclub-music-needs-restricting-to-reduce-noise-pollution-say-environmentalists_215054.html |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Visual blight and failure to "blend in" with the surrounding architecture:''  The proposed project might be ugly or particularly large, or cast a [[shadow]] over an area due to its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2014/2/20/10141252/hundreds-fret-about-superscrapers-shadows-as-extell-rebuts|title=Hundreds Fret About Superscrapers' Shadows As Extell Rebuts|first=|last=Curbed|date=20 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Loss of a community's [[new urbanism|small-town feel]]:'' Proposals that might result in new people moving into the community, such as a plan to build many new houses, are often claimed to change the community's character.
* ''Strain of public resources and schools:''  This reason is given for any increase in the local area's population, as additional school facilities might be needed for the additional children, but particularly to projects that might result in certain kinds of people joining the community, such as a [[group home]] for people with disabilities, or immigrants.
* ''Disproportionate benefit to non-locals:'' The project appears to benefit distant people, such as investors (in the case of commercial projects like factories or big-box stores) or people from neighboring areas (in the case of regional government projects, such as airports, highways, sewage treatment, or landfills).
* ''Increases in crime:'' This is usually applied to projects that are perceived as attracting or employing low-skill workers or racial minorities, as well as projects that cater to people who are thought to often commit crimes, such as the mentally ill, the poor, and drug addicts. Additionally, certain types of projects, such as [[Bar (establishment)|pubs]] or [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries, might be perceived as directly increasing the amount of crime in the area.
*''Risk of an (environmental) disaster'', such as with drilling operations, chemical industry, [[dams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esydBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=dam&amp;f=false|title=Nimby Is Beautiful: Cases of Local Activism and Environmental Innovation Around the World|first1=Carol|last1=Hager|first2=Mary Alice|last2=Haddad|date=30 March 2015|publisher=Berghahn Books|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nuclear power plants.
* ''Historic areas:'' The affected area is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], because of its many older properties that are being preserved as such.

Generally, many NIMBY objections are guessed or feared, because objections are more likely to be successful before the construction start. It is often too late to object to the project after its completion, since new additions are unlikely to be reversed.
As hinted by the list, protests can occur for opposite reasons. A new road or shopping center can cause increased traffic and work opportunities for some, and decreased traffic for others, harming local businesses.

People in an area affected by plans sometimes form an organization which can collect money and organize the objection activities. NIMBYists can hire a lawyer to do formal [[appeal]]s, and contact media to gain public support for their case.

==Origin and history==

The word appears in a June 1980 newspaper article from [[Virginia]], with the origin of the phrase explanained thus: {{quote|Some call it the Nimby Syndrome.  That's Nimby, as in "Not-in-my-back-yard"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA |date=1980-06-29 |issue=181 |volume=85 |page=1 |title=No One Wants Backyard Nuclear Dump |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24587650/nimby_1980/ |first=Ernie |last=Gates  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The phrase '"not in my back yard" syndrome', without the acronym, is found from February of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=The 'not in my back yard' syndrome is a compound of fears about health, safety, and environmental quality |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/enviroviews2n6/page/4 |title=Hazardous Wastes |first=Gillian |last=Sniatynski |work=Environment Views |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=February-March 1980  |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' earliest citation is a ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' article from November 1980, although even there the author indicates the term is already used in the hazardous waste industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/nimby.asp|title=NIMBY - Word Spy|first=Word|last=Spy|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/1106/110653.html|title=Hazardous waste|first=Emilie Travel|last=Livezey|date=6 November 1980|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept behind the term, that of locally organized resistance to unwanted land uses, is likely to have originated earlier. One suggestion is it emerged in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorino, Al. (22 March 2011)  [http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5384/do-you-have-control-over-nimbyism/ "Do You Have Control Over NIMBYism?"] ''Biomass Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the term was popularized by British politician [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], who was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for the Environment]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Comedian [[George Carlin]] used the term in a comedy skit, implying that people had already heard of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43Egm0j_p1A |title=George Carlin on N.I.M.B.Y. |publisher=''YouTube'' |format=video |accessdate=25 April 2012 |quote=We &lt;nowiki&gt;{{sic}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; got somethin' in this country (you've heard of it) -- it's called NIMBY -- n-i-m-b-y -- Not In My BackYard!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIMBY acronym has also been used by social scientists since the early 1980s to describe the resistance of communities to the siting of controversial facilities and land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Borell |first= Klas |last2= Westermark |first2= Åsa |date= 31 October 2016 |title= Siting of human services facilities and the not in my back yard phenomenon: a critical research review |journal= Community Development Journal |doi= 10.1093/cdj/bsw039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
''NIMBY'' and its derivative terms ''NIMBYism'', ''NIMBYs'', and ''NIMBYists'', refer implicitly to debates of development generally or to a specific case. As such, their use is inherently contentious. The term is usually applied to opponents of a development, implying that they have narrow, selfish, or myopic views. Its use is often [[pejorative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1968870.ece You can’t park here: it’s my retreat, says ‘Nimby’ Clooney] (''[[The Times]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Not in My Neighborhood===
The term ''Not in My Neighborhood'' (or ''NIMN'') is also frequently used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hull
 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966534,00.html
 | work = Time | publisher = Time Inc | title = Not In My Neighborhood
 | date = 25 January 1988 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "NIMN" additionally refers to legislative actions or private agreements made with the sole purpose of maintaining racial identity within a particular neighborhood or residential area by forcefully keeping members of other races from moving into the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scharper|first1=Diane|title=Ex-Sun author traces bigotry's role in shaping Baltimore|journal=The Baltimore Sun|date=21 March 2010|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-21/entertainment/bal-ae.bk.neighborhood21mar21_1_blacks-and-jews-rouse-white-woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, "Not in My Neighborhood," by author and journalist Antero Pietila, describes the toll NIMN politics had on housing conditions in Baltimore throughout the 20th century and the systemic, racially based citywide separation it caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pietila|first1=Antero|title=Not in my neighborhood : how bigotry shaped a great American city|date=2010|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|location=Chicago|isbn=1566638437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIABY===
Opposition to certain developments as inappropriate anywhere in the world is characterised by the acronym ''NIABY'' ("Not In Anyone's Backyard"). The building of [[nuclear power plant]]s, for example, is often subject to NIABY concerns.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"&gt;[http://www.translationconference.com/2008_eload/droth_julia_en.pdf translationconference.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAMBI===
''NAMBI'' ("Not Against My Business or Industry") is used as a label for any business concern that expresses umbrage with actions or policy that threaten that business, whereby they are believed to be complaining about the principle of the action or policy only for their interests alone and not for all similar business concerns who would equally suffer from the actions or policies.&lt;ref name="translationconference.com"/&gt; The term serves as a criticism of the kind of outrage that business expresses when disingenuously portraying its protest to be for the benefit of all other businesses. Such a labelling would occur, for example, when opposition expressed by a business involved in urban development is challenged by activists&amp;nbsp;– causing the business to in turn protest and appealing for support from fellow businesses lest they also find themselves challenged where they seek urban development. This term also serves as a rhetorical counter to NIMBY. Seen as an equivalent to NIMBY by those opposing the business or industry in question.

===BANANA===
''BANANA'' is an acronym for "Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything" (or "Anyone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/23/opinion/l-absolute-banana-756593.html|title=Absolute Banana|date=23 December 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/152|title=From NIMBYs To DUDEs: The Wacky World Of Plannerese|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often used to criticize the ongoing opposition of certain [[advocacy groups]] to [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/banana.asp BANANA] at Wordspy&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent opposition of some [[activist]]s to every instance of proposed development suggests that they seek a complete absence of new growth. The term is commonly used within the context of [[Land use planning|planning]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Sunderland City Council]] lists the term in their online dictionary of jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|title=Sunderland City Council|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508043826/http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/apps/gobbledygook/Define.asp?ItemId=126|archivedate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIBBY===
''PIBBY'' is an acronym for "Place In Blacks' Back Yard." This principle indicates that the people with social, racial, and economic privileges object to a development in their own back yards, and if the objectionable item must be built, then it should be built so that its perceived harms disproportionately affect poor, socially disadvantaged people. Economically disadvantaged people might not want to hire a lawyer to appeal the right way, or might have more immediate troubles than a new nearby construction project. The [[environmental justice]] movement has pointed out Nimbyism leads to [[environmental racism]]. [[Robert D. Bullard]], Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, has argued that official responses to NIMBY phenomena have led to the PIBBY principle.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, James B.

===SOBBY===
''SOBBY'' is an acronym for  "Some Other Bugger's Back Yard" and refers to the state of mind which agrees that a particular project may be desirable and perhaps necessary – but only if it is placed somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walter|first1=Liz|title=Move over Yuppies - the Magpies have arrived|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/2014/03/05/move-over-yuppies-the-magpies-have-arrived/|website=dictionaryblog.cambridge.org|publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of debate==
Although often used rather pejoratively, the use of the concept NIMBY and similar terms have been critiqued. For instance, the term is frequently used to dismiss groups as selfish or ill-informed, yet these same groups may have virtues that are overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcclymont|first=Katie|last2=O'hare|first2=Paul|date=1 June 2008|title="We're not NIMBYs!" Contrasting local protest groups with idealised conceptions of sustainable communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13549830701803273|journal=Local Environment|volume=13|issue=4|pages=321–335|doi=10.1080/13549830701803273|issn=1354-9839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of development ===
Frequently argued debate points in favor of development include higher employment, tax revenue, marginal cost of remote development, safety, and environmental benefits. Proponents of development may accuse locals of [[egotism]], [[elitism]], parochialism, [[drawbridge mentality]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Multiculturalism|diversity]], the inevitability of criticism, and misguided or unrealistic claims of prevention of [[urban sprawl]]. If people who don't want to be disturbed see the general need of an establishment, such as an airport, they generally suggest another location. But seen from society's perspective, the other location might not be better, since people living there get disturbed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdner, A. &amp; Borell, K. 2003. Neighbourhood Reactions toward Facilities for Residential Care: A Swedish Survey Study. ''Journal of Community Practice'' 11(4):59-81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In favor of local sovereignty ===
Those labeled as NIMBYs may have a variety of motivations and may be unified only because they oppose a particular project. For example, some may oppose any significant change or development, regardless of type, purpose, or origin. Others, if the project is seen as being imposed by outsiders, may hold strong principles of [[self-governance]], local [[sovereignty]], local autonomy, and [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. These people believe that local people should have the final choice, and that any project affecting the local people should clearly benefit themselves, rather than corporations with distant investors or central governments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Impact of Corporations on the Commons'', Address by Mary Zepernick at the Harvard Divinity School's Theological Opportunities Program, 21 October 2004, [http://www.poclad.org/?pg=Articles&amp;show=a041021.txt poclad.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still others may object to a particular project because of its nature, e.g., opposing a nuclear power plant over fear of radiation, but accepting a local [[waste management]] facility as a municipal necessity.

==Examples==

===Canada===

====Nova Scotia====
In July 2012, residents of Kings County rallied against a bylaw, developed over three years of consultation and hearings, allowing wind generators to be constructed nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delaney |first=Gordon |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/114564-which-way-does-the-wind-blow |title=Which way does the wind blow? |work=The Chronicle Herald |date=7 July 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar theme arose in September 2009, where residents there rallied against a wind generator in Digby Neck, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contrarian.ca/2009/09/09/nimby-neck/ |title=NIMBY Neck – updated : Contrarian |publisher=Contrarian.ca |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, residents of Lawrencetown, NS openly opposed a cell tower being built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/01/25/ns-lawrencetown-tower-petition.html |title=Cell tower opposed in Lawrencetown |publisher=CBC News |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed development of downtown Dartmouth in August 2012 was also contested by residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croucher |first=Philip |url=http://metronews.ca/news/halifax/352477/public-hearing-thursday-for-planned-downtown-dartmouth-development/ |title=Public hearing Thursday for planned downtown Dartmouth development &amp;#124; Metro |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, some residents of Lunenburg County opposed wind farms being built in the area, saying, "It's health and it's property devaluation" and "This is an industrial facility put in the middle of rural Nova Scotia. It does not belong there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/05/ns-south-canoe-wind-project.html |title=Lunenburg County debates province's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, some residents of the community of Blockhouse opposed the building and development of a recycling plant, referred to by one business owner as a "dump." The plant would offer 75 jobs to the community of roughly 5,900 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/negative-feedback-towards-new-development-in-n-s-community-1.1191335 |title=Negative feedback towards new development in N.S. community |publisher=CTV Atlantic News |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the municipal councilors of Chester, Nova Scotia, approved the building of wind turbines in the area in a 6–1 vote, despite some local opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/03/15/ns-south-canoe-approved.html |title=Chester approves Nova Scotia's largest wind farm |publisher=CBC News |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|nail house}}

In China there were many famous cases of nail houses, including one property holdout who had expressways built around and completely encircled his apartment building in Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Varinsky | first=Dana | title=The owners of these defiant 'nail houses' in China refuse to give in to developers | website=Business Insider | date=2016-08-20 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-chinese-nail-houses-2016-8 | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=China's 'nail houses': The homeowners who refused to budge | website=CNN | date=2015-05-19 | url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/19/asia/gallery/china-nail-houses/index.html | access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
When Christian Zheng Sheng College, a correctional school for young drug addicts, opened in 1998, several people called it an eyesore. In June 2009, residents of Mui Wo voiced objection when they announced they are planning to move their campus into an empty school building there.

===Italy===
The [[No TAV]] opposition to the [[Turin–Lyon high-speed railway]] is often characterized as a NIMBY movement.

===Japan===
The Muraiken Undō or [[No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement]], was a government funded Japanese public health and social movement which began between 1929 and 1934.

In 2001, when the leprosy prevention law was ruled unconstitutional, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Welfare, and the National Diet published statements of apology to leprosy patients and their families. Several prefectural governors made apologies at public sanatoriums.

Two famous incidents where NIMBY's ruled over Greater Tokyo interests. [[Shinkansen]] have been extensively engineered to mitigate impacts of [[tunnel boom]] due to complaints by nearby residents, such that Japan is the only country with such strict regulations (and accompanying financial burdens) on tunnel and aerodynamic designs.  This is one of the key reasons there are so many Shinkansen trainset designs that have been developed.

==== Narita Airport ====
One is the farmers of [[Narita International Airport]], the metropolis' only international link to the outside world, who resisted since 1974 any tiny bit of land allocation.  Originally the plan for the airport also includes a [[Narita Shinkansen|high speed railway]] line that was scrapped.  The NIMBYs additionally prevented extension of the congested airport's very short 2nd runway (unusable for anything but short haul [[Narrow-body aircraft]]) until the late 2000s, when finally cross town [[Haneda Airport]] was opened to international traffic as additional runways on landfill were completed at many billions of dollars of extra costs, as the 2nd runway was lengthened to 2,500 meters.  The 2nd Narita runway still runs short of its original 1974 blueprints and impacts airport operational capacity.

==== Odakyu Double Tracking ====
[[Odakyu Electric Railway]], now providing transit along a corridor with 5 million people living in walking distance of its rail and feeder bus service area&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;, was originally built prewar era, and as the city of Tokyo's population ballooned rail demand in suburbs exploded.  By 1960s, [[Pusher (railway station attendant)|''oshiya'' pushers]] were required to squash people into packed trains, and Odakyu Railway sought to expand its two-track lines to four&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"&gt;https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/How-do-railways-figure-out-congestion-on-their-trains-&lt;/ref&gt;, thus allowing more passing trains and faster run times as well as less crowding and congestive wait and hold of trains.  NIMBY residents aside the line in [[Setagaya]] ward fought off attempts by the railway to acquire land, Odakyu did not want to make a scene so they attempted to buy land one by one by offering high prices.  The Setagaya Residents' opposition set the stage for a long-term and remarkable NIMBY cases in the courts and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;https://science-train.com/w/Odakyu_Electric_Railway/History.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1993, after 3 decades of trying, it was apparent this plan was failing, and the company decided to go for an multi-billion dollar solution: tunneling two lines underground, and then adding back two new lines stacked on top, to make 4 tracks in each direction for 12 stations and 10.4 km, instead of acquiring the land.&lt;ref name="odakyu"/&gt;  The company's decision began in 1993 and completed in 2004 for 1 critical section, meanwhile, for the 2nd smaller section, this same decision was made in 2003 with project completion finally approaching fruition in March 2018, nearly 6 decades later.&lt;ref name="jtkuchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odakyu"&gt;http://www.odakyu.jp/ir/shared/pdf/annual/2015/fukufuku.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Ashtead, Surrey====
In the affluent [[England|English]] village of [[Ashtead]], [[Surrey]], which lies on the outskirts of [[London]], residents objected in 2007&lt;ref name="ylg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/epsomnews/display.var.1558300.0.0.php|title=No heroes in my backyard|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the conversion of a large, [[Pound sterling|£]]1.7&amp;nbsp;million residential property into a family support centre for relatives of wounded British service personnel. The house was to be purchased by a registered charity, [[SSAFA|SSAFA Forces Help]].&lt;ref name="ylg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html ''Headley Court Families Accommodation'' (SSAFA Forces Help)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090820/http://www.ssafa.org.uk/HeadleyCourt.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=468619&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=Smart school uniforms linked to academic success of UK's schools|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents objected to the proposal out of fear of increased traffic and noise, as well as the possibility of an increased threat of terrorism. They also contended that the SSAFA charity is actually a business, thereby setting an unwelcome precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mole-valley.gov.uk/cwi/getDocument?docId=112803&amp;account=planning&amp;amp;ref=MO/2007/0863&amp;filename=Letter%20of%20Representation|title=Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local newspapers ran articles titled "Nimby neighbours' war with wounded soldiers' families" and "No Heroes in my Backyard."

Ex-servicemen and several members of the British general public organised a petition in support of SSAFA, and even auctioned the "Self Respect of Ashtead" on [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3641566/Legless-boys-mammas-Not-in-Ashtead.html | work=telegraph.co.uk | title=Legless boys' mammas?

====High Speed 2====
Particularly in the run up to the final decision on the route of the high-speed railway known as [[High Speed 2]], BBC News Online reported that many residents of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies were launching objections to the HS2 route based on the effects it would have on them, whilst also showing concerns that HS2 is unlikely to have a societal benefit at a macro level under the current economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12037578|title=The farm lying in the path of the new rail route|date=20 December 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12002171|title=Tory vs Tory on high speed rail|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Labour MP [[Natascha Engel]]—through whose constituency the line will pass—offered a "passionate defence of nimbyism" in the House of Commons, with regards to the effects the line would have on home- and business-owning constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/chan24.pdf|date=26 June 2013|speaker=[[Natascha Engel]]|house=House of Commons|column_start=378|column_end=380|volume=565|no=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; HS2 has also been characterised by residents of the [[Chilterns]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] making arguments against the supposed lack of a business case for the line, often as a smokescreen for NIMBYism. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Camden's NIMBYs were successful in their campaign to derail the HS1–HS2 link railway.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26604074&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heathrow Airport====
In November 2007 a consultation process began for the building of a new third runway and a sixth terminal and it was controversially&lt;ref name="Ref_2009"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/01/15/heathrow.third.runway/index.html | work=CNN | title=Britain: Third Heathrow runway approved despite opposition - CNN.com | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approved on 15 January 2009 by UK Government ministers.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7829676.stm|title=BBC News - Go-ahead for new Heathrow runway|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was then cancelled on 12 May 2010 by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron Government]].&lt;ref name=Cancelled&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8678282.stm|title=BBC News - Heathrow runway plans scrapped by new government|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wimbledon, London====

The [[London Borough of Merton]] did not have enough school places for local children who would be reaching school age in 2012 and 2013.

===United States===
Research shows that NIMBYism is bipartisan in the United States, with both conservatives and liberals opposing new housing developments in their localities. White neighborhoods and cities tend to favor more restrictive housing development policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&amp;smtyp=cur|title=The Bipartisan Cry of ‘Not in My Backyard’|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in ''[[Perspectives on Politics]]'' found that "individuals who are older, male, longtime residents, voters in local elections, and homeowners are significantly more likely to participate" in local government, and that "these individuals overwhelmingly (and to a much greater degree than the general public) oppose new housing construction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4kzph3ynal3xai/ZoningParticipation_Perspectives_Final.pdf?dl=0|title=Who Participates in Local Government?

According to a 2017 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, there is a shortage of 7.4 million affordable homes available for rent to extremely low income (ELI) households in the United States.  As a result, seventy-one percent of ELI households are forced to spend over half of their income on housing costs leading to severe financial burdens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Gap-Report_2017.pdf|title=The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/assessing-the-severity-of-rent-burden-on-low-income-families-20171222.htm|title=Assessing the Severity of Rent Burden on Low-Income Families|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, while the need for more affordable housing is evident, opposition from “Not-in-my-backyard” or NIMBY activists present significant challenges to affordable housing developments, resulting in costly design changes, construction delays, and permit denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|title=Democracy in Action?: NIMBY as Impediment to Equitable Affordable Housing Siting|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that proactive outreach and communication by affordable housing developers and proponents through the leveraging of social marketing and positive messaging can overcome common NIMBY barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beben|first=Robert|title=The Role of Social Marketing in Overcoming the NIMBY Syndrome|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02673037.2015.1013093|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockne|first=Anna|title=Not in My Backyard: Using Communications to Shift "NIMBY" Attitudes about Affordable Housing|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/198187/ARockne%20Capstone%206.28.18.pdf?sequence=1|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
A small number of residents (mostly farmers) in [[Hanford, California]] and surrounding areas are opposed to the [[California High-Speed Rail Authority]] building high-speed rail near farmland, citing that it will bring environmental and economic problems.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Wealthy residents of southern Orange County, CA defeated a local measure that proposed to convert the decommissioned El Toro Marine Base into a commercial airport, claiming that the airport would be "unsafe" during landings and take-offs as well as create air quality issues. The real issue was the FAA planned the flight paths for the airport over expensive neighborhoods of the south Orange County and residents feared that their property values would decrease.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The airport proposal, however, was strongly supported by Northern Orange County residents. The defeat of the local measure resulted in the creation of the [[Orange County Great Park]].

National, state and local environmentalists, historic preservationists and long time residents of South [[Pasadena, California]] have been successfully opposing the completion of the highly controversial State Route 710 through the cities of Los Angeles (El Sereno), South Pasadena and Pasadena for over 60 years. There has been a federal injunction in place for 41 years stopping construction of the surface freeway. USC and UCLA urban and transportation planning students study this 80-year-old controversy because it is a classic example of sustained grass-roots opposition to a government proposal.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Now and for over a decade, a struggle has been brewing in [[San Francisco, California]] between the voting public and the influx of young professionals and tech workers. With no room to expand, construction companies can only build up in order to meet the increasing housing demand. However, NIMBYism has prevented high rise construction from spreading in San Francisco, citing restrictions on buildings' shadows and the dramatic changes proposed to the waterfront skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dineen|first=J.K.|title=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2013/07/nimbys-are-back-sf-builders-face.html|work=NIMBYs are back: S.F. builders face growing backlash|publisher="Biz Journals"|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition argues that new construction will increase the supply of luxury housing without creating affordable housing, thus raising the average rent while by attracting a wealthier population to the city of San Francisco and forcing middle and lower income families out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|title=8 Washington Luxury Waterfront Condo Development Project Vote Likely To Make It Onto November Ballot|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/8-washington_n_1690575.html|accessdate=29 January 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September 2017, 15 housing bills were signed into law by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] to combat the state's [[California housing shortage|housing shortage]]. Many of these bills are considered direct attempts to reduce the ability of private citizens to prevent housing projects from going forward, even being referred to by some as "Anti-NIMBY" bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meyersnave.com/legislatures-year-housing-produces-broad-package-bills-stimulate-affordable-housing-construction/|title=The Legislature's "Year Of Housing" Produces Broad Package of Bills to Stimulate Affordable Housing Construction - Meyers {{!}} Nave|website=www.meyersnave.com|language=en-US|access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-legislation-signed-20170929-htmlstory.html|title=Gov.

====Florida====
Similar to the situation in Nantucket Sound, Mass., a minority of residents in [[St. Lucie County]], Florida have vehemently opposed the construction of wind turbines in the county. The construction of the wind turbines was strongly supported by over 80% of county residents according to a 2008 [[Florida Power and Light]] (FPL) poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617010520/https://www.palmbeachpost.com/search/content/tcoast/epaper/2008/04/03/m1b_slwind_0402.html|title=Survey supports turbines, FPL says|last=Quinlan|first=Paul|date=2008-04-03|website=The Palm Beach Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the power company proposed building the turbines in a location on a beach near a prior existing nuclear power plant owned by the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the 1980s, a agency known as the Palm Beach County Expressway Authority was formed to develop a series of east/west highways to take people from suburban Palm Beach County into downtown [[West Palm Beach]]. This was done in anticipation of [[population growth]] that would happen over the next decades in Palm Beach County that would bring in more traffic. Many neighbors in areas such as Westgate and Lake Belvedere Estates strongly opposed this plan citing it would wipe out their neighborhoods. Ultimately the plan was revised to create [[Florida State Road 80|SR-80]] Boulevard into an express like roadway by eliminating traffic lights and overpassing other local roadways.

====Illinois====
In 1959, when [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]] officials learned that a developer building a neighborhood of large new homes planned to make houses available to [[African Americans]], they issued a stop-work order. An intense debate began about racial integration, property values, and the good faith of the residents, community officials and builders. For a brief time, Deerfield was spotlighted in the national news as "the Little Rock of the North."&lt;ref name="ros001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosen | first = Harry | authorlink = Harry Rosen (author) |author2=David Rosen  | title = But Not Next Door | publisher = Astor-Honor Inc | year = 1962 | isbn = 0-8392-1007-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of integration were denounced and ostracized by residents. Eventually, the village passed a referendum to build parks on the property, thus putting an end to the housing development. Two model homes already partially completed were sold to village officials.&lt;ref name="ros001" /&gt; Otherwise, the land lay dormant for years before it was developed into what is now Mitchell Pool and Park and Jaycee Park. The first black family did not move into Deerfield until much later, and in years since Deerfield has seen a greater influx of minorities, including Jews, Asians, Greeks and others. This episode in Deerfield's history is described in ''But Not Next Door'' by Harry and David Rosen, both residents of Deerfield.

==== Massachusetts ====
Opposition to two proposed freeways within the [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|MA Route 128]] beltway road around Boston—the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]] and the routing of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts]] into downtown Boston via the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]]—were opposed from their proposals during the 1950s era, and finally cancelled by the actions of then-Governor [[Francis Sargent]] in 1970. The [[MBTA Orange Line]] heavy rail rapid transit line's southern route was eventually re-located along much of the Southwest Corridor right-of-way for the cancelled I-95's roadbed in the late 1980s, when the Orange Line's [[Washington Street Elevated]] tracks were torn down at the time.

Some residents and businesses of [[Cape Cod]], [[Martha's Vineyard]], and [[Nantucket Island]] have opposed construction of [[Cape Wind]], a proposed offshore [[wind farm]] in [[Nantucket Sound]]. Proponents cite the environmental, economic, and [[energy security]] benefits of clean, [[renewable energy]], while opponents are against any obstruction to the views from oceanfront vacation homes and tourist destinations based in the region.

====Minnesota====
In the late 1990s a proposal for [[commuter rail]] on the [[Dan Patch Corridor]] between [[Minneapolis]] and [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]] was studied. In 2002, due to opposition from neighborhoods along the corridor, two state representatives from the suburbs of [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]] and [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]] passed a legislative ban not allowing further study, discussion, funding, and construction of the project. While the ban is still in place despite numerous attempts to repeal it, the two suburbs that sponsored the ban are now open to the proposal. [[Lakeville, Minnesota|Lakeville]] and [[St. Louis Park]] remain opposed to the project and repealing the ban.

====New York====
In [[Long Island]], various electrification and expansion projects of the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) were substantially delayed due to the protests of people living near the railroad. For example, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] has proposed to build a [[Third Track Project|third track]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] from [[Floral Park station]] to [[Hicksville station]] in order to increase capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/lirr/News/2008/MainLineCorridorImprovements.pdf|title=MTA Long Island Rail Road East Side Access and Third Track – Main Line Corridor Improvements|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=4 July 2018|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rather | first=John | title=Third-Track Project Finds Its Nemesis | website=The New York Times | date=10 July 2005 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/nyregion/thirdtrack-project-finds-its-nemesis.html | access-date=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most communities along the route supported [[grade crossing]] eliminations as part of the project, there was fierce opposition for building a third track from the villages of [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]], [[New Hyde Park, New York|New Hyde Park]], and [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], which said the construction and the resulting increased train service will reduce the quality of life in their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |title=Floral Park Mayor To Address LIRR Expansion |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=11 November 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322080533/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2005/1111/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=22 March 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |title=Residents: MTA/LIRR Needs to Get on Right Track |author=Carisa Keane |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=New Hyde Park Illustrated News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195104/http://www.antonnews.com/illustratednews/2005/06/24/news/ |archivedate=27 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |title=Village Meets With LIRR On "Third Track" Project |author=Stephanie Mariel Petrellese |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2006 |publisher=The Garden City News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112195001/http://www.gcnews.com/news/2006/1215/Front_Page/001.html |archivedate=12 January 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third track project was suspended indefinitely in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14lirrli.html |title=Third-Track Plan Isn’t Dead, L.I.R.R.

In [[Port Washington, New York]], a dispute broke out between the town of [[North Hempstead, New York|North Hempstead]] and the LIRR over a proposed yard expansion at [[Port Washington station]]. To expand the yard, a parking lot belonging to the town would need to be reduced in size, but a local councilperson stated that the addition of the tracks "will completely ruin the character of the town."&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/lirr-plan-would-run-more-trains-to-nyc-1.5263966 |title=LIRR plan would run more trains to NYC |publisher=Newsday |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LIRR was able to expand the yard without the agreement of North Hempstead by tearing up 140 parking spaces of its own parking lot, also adjacent to the station.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;

Community opposition also led to the cancellation of a proposed extension of the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] (carrying the {{NYCS trains|Astoria}}) to [[LaGuardia Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2003/0716/Front_Page/002.html|title=N Train Extension To LaG Scrapped|last=Toscano|first=John|date=July 16, 2003|newspaper=Queens Gazette|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2007-06-27/Features/Flashback_To_1999_001.html|title=Flashback To 1999 &amp;#124; www.qgazette.com &amp;#124; Queens Gazette|date=June 27, 2007|publisher=www.qgazette.com|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, opposition has killed any proposal to build a [[Long Island Sound link|bridge or tunnel across the Long Island Sound]] with some believing it will harm their communities with an influx of unwanted traffic as well as concerns regarding the environment and the number of homes that would be cleared as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Steve|last2=Herman|first2=Ralph|last3=Willinger|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Schlictman|first4=Paul|title=Overview: Oyster Bay-Rye Bridge (I-287, unbuilt)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/oysterbay-rye/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of Cuyo''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional de Cuyo}}, UNCuyo) is the largest center of higher education in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

As of 2005, the university had 12 academic schools in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and a delegation in the city of [[San Rafael, Mendoza|San Rafael]] (province of Mendoza), in addition to the [[Balseiro Institute]], which is the most developed institute of Physics research in Argentina, located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] (province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]]). It includes the University Technological Institute which offers technical education in four other cities in Mendoza province. Moreover, UNCuyo is also devoted to improving education due to having 7 other buildings working as High Schools:

* C.U.C. (Colegio Universitario Central "Gral. Jose de San Martin")
* Escuela de Comercio Martín Zapata
* Liceo Agrícola Domingo Faustino Sarmiento
* Escuela del Magisterio
* Escuela de Agricultura
* D.A.D (Departamento de Aplicación Docente)
* Escuela Carmen Vera Arenas
[[File:Campus UNCuyo.jpg|thumb|Campus]]

==History==
The UNCuyo was established on March 21, 1939 by the presidential decree 26971. The university was established to offer tertiary education provision in the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (the provinces of Mendoza, [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]). At its foundation the university was composed of some existing higher education colleges, and new ones were incorporated. Regional affiliations were established in Human Sciences, Medicine, Agronomy and Economics in Mendoza, Engineering and Architecture in San Juan, and Natural Sciences in San Luis. These links remained in place until 1973. That year the [[National University of San Juan]] and the [[National University of San Luis]] were established from the adjunct faculties of the National University of Cuyo already in these regions. Thereafter, the National University of Cuyo concentrated itself in Mendoza, in addition to a campus in Río Negro Province: the [[Balseiro Institute]].

==Recent research==
In recent research conducted by UNCuyo's students it was discovered how methods of cutting and preparing food can affect how many nutrients are retained in a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/30/cl.bringing.out.best/index.html#cnnSTCText?iref=werecommend Coax flavor, nutrition from produce with proper care, handling]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably they found that the thiosulfinates (that inhibit platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding) found in garlic and onions do not form until crushing or cutting. The research also demonstrated that steaming instead boiling is preferable as vegetables retain more of their water-soluble vitamins.

The '''Nelson–Aalen estimator''' is a [[nonparametric statistics|non-parametric estimator]] of the [[hazard rate|cumulative hazard rate]] function in case of [[Censoring (statistics)|censored data]] or [[missing data|incomplete data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tkchen.wordpress.com/2008/09/21/kaplan-meier-and-nelson-aalen-estimators/|title=Kaplan–Meier and Nelson–Aalen Estimators}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[survival analysis|survival theory]], [[reliability engineering]] and [[life insurance]] to estimate the cumulative number of expected events. An "event" can be the failure of a non-repairable component, the death of a human being, or any occurrence for which the experimental unit remains in the "failed" state (e.g., death) from the point at which it changed on. The [[estimator]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{H}(t)=\sum_{t_i\leq t}\frac{d_i}{n_i},&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; the number of events at &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; the total individuals at risk at &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statsdirect.com/help/survival_analysis/kaplan.htm|title=Kaplan–Meier Survival Estimates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the Nelson–Aalen estimator gives an idea of the hazard rate shape. A concave shape is an indicator for [[bathtub curve|infant mortality]] while a convex shape indicates [[bathtub curve|wear out mortality]].

It can be used for example when testing the homogeneity of [[Poisson process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jan |last=Kysely |first2=Jan |last2=Picek |first3=Romana |last3=Beranova |year=2010 |title=Estimating extremes in climate change simulations using the peaks-over-threshold method with a non-stationary threshold |journal=Global and Planetary Change |volume=72 |issue=1-2 |pages=55–68 |doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54510">'''Physical oncology''' (PO) is defined as the study of the role of mechanical signals in a [[cancerous tumor]]. The mechanical signals can be forces, pressures ("pull", "push" and "shear" designating the forces / pressures that push, pull or are tangential). If we generalize we will speak of "[[stress field]]" and "[[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jonietz|first=Erika|date=2012-11-21|title=Mechanics: The forces of cancer|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/491S56a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=491|issue=7425|pages=S56–S57|doi=10.1038/491s56a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/45603/title/The-Forces-of-Cancer/|title=The Forces of Cancer|website=The Scientist|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Karin|last2=Cai|first2=Li-Heng|last3=Lan|first3=Bo|last4=Fredberg|first4=Jeffrey J|date=2016-01-28|title=Hidden in the mist no more: physical force in cell biology|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth.3744|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=124–125|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3744|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4861038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cancerous tumor (or "solid tumor" in the jargon of oncologists to differentiate them from hematological malignancies) is an organ consisting of two tissues: in the center the cancerous tumor proper and around the [[Extracellular matrix|ExtraCellular Matrix]] (ECM), sometimes called stroma, chorion or connective tissue. The concept of connective tissue is interesting because it defines a tissue that travels the entire organism (except the brain) and is a preferred transmitter of mechanical signals. But for the cancer organ - isolated from this connective system - we prefer the term ECM.

The cancerous tissue is derived from a normal tissue of the body: breast cancer arises from a cancerous transformation of the normal mammary glandular tissue. It looks more or less like the original tissue: it is said that it is more or less differentiated; poorly differentiated it has a microscopic appearance that is far from normal tissue and is then "poorly prognostic", will make more metastases and will be more difficult to treat.

We are only considering cancers derived from "epithelia", that is to say the tissue that covers the organs in their interfaces with air, liquids ... or the outside world. Epithelial cells are contiguous and polarized. More than 90% of cancers (breast, prostate, colon / rectum, bronchi, pancreas, etc.) arise from these epithelia after a long process of cancerization.

== Both tissues of the cancer organ ==

=== The ECM ===
ECM is a mixture of cells (immune, [[fibroblast]]s, etc.) dispersed in proteins, most of them [[collagen]]. It surrounds the tumor.

It is analogous to connective tissue and [[basal membrane]], which is a local condensation, located below normal epithelia. This connective tissue allows oxygen and nutrients to diffuse to the epithelia, which are not vascularized.

In the tumor ECM, rapidly, beyond one mm3 of tumor is formed a network of blood vessels, the "neovascularization" (induced by "[[neoangiogenesis]]") around the tumor and which will allow the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients in the cancer tissue itself, which is not vascularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickup|first=Michael W.|last2=Mouw|first2=Janna K.|last3=Weaver|first3=Valerie M.|date=2014-12-01|title=The extracellular matrix modulates the hallmarks of cancer|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/15/12/1243|journal=EMBO Reports|language=en|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1243–1253|doi=10.15252/embr.201439246|issn=1469-221X|pmid=25381661|pmc=4264927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cancerous tissue ===
The cancerous tissue itself, derived from the cancerous transformation of an epithelium.

== Cancerization ==
It's a multi-year process. The appearance of cancer is signified by the crossing of the basement membrane to the underlying connective tissue by one or more cancer cells.

== The rediscovery of the importance of mechanical signals in biology of living organisms ==
Several teams, in the USA in particular, had maintained an expertise in the study of non-biological signals in oncology (Donald Ingber, Mina Bissell then Valerie Weaver, Rakesh J Jain among others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bissell|first=Mina J.|last2=Hall|first2=H.Glenn|last3=Parry|first3=Gordon|title=How does the extracellular matrix direct gene expression?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022519382903885|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=99|issue=1|pages=31–68|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90388-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11972757|title=Gene expression during normal and malignant differentiation|date=1985|publisher=Academic Press|others=Andersson, Leif C., Gahmberg, C.

But the absolute dominance of genetics and molecular biology since the middle of the 20th century had marginalized this approach until its revival at the beginning of the 21st century. This renewal takes into account the immense gains of genetics and molecular biology in the mechanobiological approach. On the other hand, the PO validates results thanks to these achievements but does not use the concepts.

The use of mechanical signals is therefore also the support of mechanobiology whose objective is very different from the PO. Indeed, as shown in the table above, the study of [[mechanotransduction]], which is the support of mechanobiology, uses a mechanical "input" (signal input) but the signal collected at the output (the "output") is biological. As a result, many of the articles published in mechanobiology end with the phrase "we have defined a target to find a therapeutic molecule", which precludes any therapeutic approach by the mechanical signals themselves.

But this shift from the physical sciences to the biological sciences is problematic, in the absence of any bridge between these two sciences, one quantitative, physics based on mathematical language and the other qualitative, based on the laws of genetics and molecular biology.

OP aims to study the effect of a mechanical input on a mechanical output. We will see that this output can be synthesized in tissue architecture.

== Definition of the tissue [[phenotype]] ==
The diagnosis of cancer is made by looking under the microscope a fragment of the tumor (biopsy). The tissue phenotype - here cancerous tissue - is the sum of the cellular and tissue phenotype. The phenotype of the cell is supposed to be the translation of the genotype (and of the environment: epigenetics) expressed in a given cell: thus, a liver cell does not look like a pancreas cell at all because it does not express the same genes (yet all present in the genome of all cells).

These characteristics are summarized by: differentiation, cell division (mitosis), apoptosis (or "cell suicide") and cell death. The doctor in charge of the diagnosis under the microscope (the pathologist) will describe the biopsy based on these criteria. The tissue phenotype is centered on architecture: the normal tissue is Euclidian (hexagons, trapezes, circles ...) familiar to our brains; the cancerous is fractal, less familiar. It can be summed up in a coefficient of fractality very strongly correlated with the prognosis and the components of the cellular phenotype. Thus, a high coefficient of fractality is correlated with a poorly differentiated tumor, with many mitoses, little apoptosis and a poor prognosis.

And here we have to mention Mina Bissell: "in oncology the tissue phenotype is dominant over the cellular genotype".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Celeste M.|last2=Bissell|first2=Mina J.|date=2006-10-09|title=Of Extracellular Matrix, Scaffolds, and Signaling: Tissue Architecture Regulates Development, Homeostasis, and Cancer|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104315|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=287–309|doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104315|issn=1081-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The quiet revolution: three-dimensional models (3D) and other models (spheroids, animal xenograft ...) ==
OP was made possible by apparently minor technical changes that allowed in vitro and then in vivo models to be closer to the reality of the cancerous tumor in the patient.

For a very long time, two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have been used in glass and then plastic boxes. The cultured cells thus adhered to the bottom, in very rigid material, rigidity measured by the Young's modulus, very high for these supports.

=== Young's module ===
The Young modulus or modulus of elasticity is the constant that relates the tensile / compressive stress and the beginning of the deformation of an isotropic elastic material.

It is expressed in [[Pascal (unit)|Pascal]] (Pa), unit of pressure.

Then appeared the three-dimensional (3D) cultures with cells which constituted multicellular spheres by dividing and were surrounded by a gel-like culture medium at the Young's modulus close to those of the living and variable tissues, for example depending on the amount of collagen surrounding these cultures in 3D.

At the same time the animal models evolved there also towards more similarity with the clinical reality. The human tumor xenograft is today the standard and the orthotopic transplant - for example human cancer of the pancreas in the mouse pancreas - is one of the best experimental models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Ketao|last2=Teng|first2=Lisong|last3=Shen|first3=Yanping|last4=He|first4=Kuifeng|last5=Xu|first5=Zhenzhen|last6=Li|first6=Guangliang|date=2010-07-01|title=Patient-derived human tumour tissue xenografts in immunodeficient mice: a systematic review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12094-010-0540-6|journal=Clinical and Translational Oncology|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=473–480|doi=10.1007/s12094-010-0540-6|issn=1699-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between the clinic and the experiment becomes more realistic since these 3D cultures make it possible to use the culture medium surrounding the growing tumor tissue as a "virtual ECM", which can be varied, for example, to increase the pressure around the tumor grown.

Similarly, xenograft can constitute a cancer organ with both tissues even if the ECM is of animal origin.

'''What is hard in cancer'''

It's the ECM. So, when a doctor or a patient feels "a hard lump in the breast" and it is a cancer, what is hard is the ECM while the tumor itself is softer than the normal breast tissue. This has been demonstrated in vitro and more recently ex vivo and will soon be in vivo.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== In vitro ===
The role of stress on the growth of a spheroid in vitro had already been shown (G Helminger already cited), but the experiment of Matthew Paszek (last signatory of the article: Valerie Weaver) in 2005 will give a new dimension to this use of mechanical signals in vitro by showing the passage from a normal architecture of a breast acinus - the elementary unit of the mammary gland - to a cancerous architecture under the influence of a single variable, mechanical, here the surface tension caused by an increasing concentration of collagen in the culture medium surrounding the tumor.
[[File:Acinus.jpg|center]]
We clearly see the transition from one architecture to another, progressive and reversible if the constraint is relaxed. Changes in the concentration of biological markers of cancerization [[Catenin|(catenins]], [[integrin]]s, etc.), with the disappearance of the central cavity, highlight the shift in tissue phenotype.

In addition, this experiment opens the way to the reversibility of cancer, the royal way of treatment, which is intended to replace conventional destructive approaches.

Another experiment is equally spectacular:
[[File:Fractal à euclidien.jpg|center]]

According to Gautham Venugopalan ASCB 2012

Malignant breast cells cultured in vitro in 3D form a "disorganized" mass (translate fractal) on the left in the photo.	

But after a few minutes of compression, they form an acinus, Euclidian, on the right.	

Other authors have extended this work on different models with different mechanical signals. F Montel et al., in particular, has demonstrated on spheroids of human cancer origin the very significant increase in apoptosis in the response to stress.	

These 3D cultures have also shown the organization of collagen fibers within the ECM and beyond, allowing remote transmission of mechanical signals and a 'tensor dialogue' between the tumor, ECM and normal environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paszek|first=Matthew J.|last2=Zahir|first2=Nastaran|last3=Johnson|first3=Kandice R.|last4=Lakins|first4=Johnathon N.|last5=Rozenberg|first5=Gabriela I.|last6=Gefen|first6=Amit|last7=Reinhart-King|first7=Cynthia A.|last8=Margulies|first8=Susan S.|last9=Dembo|first9=Micah|title=Tensional homeostasis and the malignant phenotype|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610805002680|journal=Cancer Cell|volume=8|issue=3|pages=241–254|doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2005.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trepat|first=Xavier|date=2011-10-24|title=Viewpoint: Forcing Tumor Arrest|url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v4/85?referer=apspubspage|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montel|first=Fabien|date=2011|title=Stress Clamp Experiments on Multicellular Tumor Spheroids|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.188102|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=107|issue=18|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.107.188102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Gang|last2=Tse|first2=Janet|last3=Jain|first3=Rakesh K.|last4=Munn|first4=Lance L.|date=2009-02-27|title=Micro-Environmental Mechanical Stress Controls Tumor Spheroid Size and Morphology by Suppressing Proliferation and Inducing Apoptosis in Cancer Cells|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004632|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e4632|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004632|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olcum|first=Melis|last2=Ozcivici|first2=Engin|date=2014-10-14|title=Daily application of low magnitude mechanical stimulus inhibits the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-014-0102-z|journal=Cancer Cell International|volume=14|page=102|doi=10.1186/s12935-014-0102-z|issn=1475-2867}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

But these experiments have in common to apply physical variables (surface tension, osmotic pressure ...) that cannot be used in vivo.	

=== [[Ex vivo]] ===
M Plodinec et al. extended this work using breast cancer biopsies kept alive ex vivo and then passed to an [[Atomic force microscopy|Atomic Force Microscope]] (AFM) to measure the Young's moduli of the different tissue components of these normal breast biopsies, tumors benign and malignant.	

This team finds the results already widely explored on isolated cells and 2D cultures: the cancerous tissues have a Young's modulus around 0.8 kPa, normal tissues have a modulus around 1.1 kPa. The ECM has a module greater than 2 kPa.	

This difference - the cancerous tissue is softer than its normal counterpart - crosses all oncology, all cancers combined and from the dysplastic cell to the tumor and metastatic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plodinec|first=Marija|last2=Loparic|first2=Marko|last3=Monnier|first3=Christophe A.|last4=Obermann|first4=Ellen C.|last5=Zanetti-Dallenbach|first5=Rosanna|last6=Oertle|first6=Philipp|last7=Hyotyla|first7=Janne T.|last8=Aebi|first8=Ueli|last9=Bentires-Alj|first9=Mohamed|title=The Nanomechanical Signature of Breast Cancer|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006349512030251|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=104|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2012.11.1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuhrmann|first=A|last2=Staunton|first2=J R|last3=Nandakumar|first3=V|last4=Banyai|first4=N|last5=Davies|first5=P C W|last6=Ros|first6=R|title=AFM stiffness nanotomography of normal, metaplastic and dysplastic human esophageal cells|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1478-3975/8/i=1/a=015007?key=crossref.7eaf6644e77fe9bd5c06e809b2b682b3|journal=Physical Biology|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1088/1478-3975/8/1/015007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lekka|first=Małgorzata|last2=Pogoda|first2=Katarzyna|last3=Gostek|first3=Justyna|last4=Klymenko|first4=Olesya|last5=Prauzner-Bechcicki|first5=Szymon|last6=Wiltowska-Zuber|first6=Joanna|last7=Jaczewska|first7=Justyna|last8=Lekki|first8=Janusz|last9=Stachura|first9=Zbigniew|title=Cancer cell recognition – Mechanical phenotype|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968432812000200|journal=Micron|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1259–1266|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2012.01.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cross|first=Sarah E|last2=Jin|first2=Yu-Sheng|last3=Tondre|first3=Julianne|last4=Wong|first4=Roger|last5=Rao|first5=JianYu|last6=Gimzewski|first6=James K|title=AFM-based analysis of human metastatic cancer cells|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0957-4484/19/i=38/a=384003?key=crossref.d4a31793ac4bc22bb50977f626d29a83|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=19|issue=38|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/19/38/384003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Wenwei|last2=Mezencev|first2=Roman|last3=Kim|first3=Byungkyu|last4=Wang|first4=Lijuan|last5=McDonald|first5=John|last6=Sulchek|first6=Todd|date=2012-10-04|title=Cell Stiffness Is a Biomarker of the Metastatic Potential of Ovarian Cancer Cells|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046609|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46609|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046609|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;	

All measurements, cell and tissue, converge towards the same conclusion: the modulus of the cancerous tissue is inversely correlated with the 'dangerousness' of the cancer: the softer the tumor, the more it is undifferentiated, the more it will give metastases, the less it will respond to current treatments...	

=== In vivo ===
In OP for therapeutic purposes, we find only the article by R Brossel et al. (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brossel|first=Rémy|last2=Yahi|first2=Alexandre|last3=David|first3=Stéphane|last4=Velasquez|first4=Laura Moreno|last5=Guinebretière|first5=Jean-Marc|date=2016-04-21|title=Mechanical Signals Inhibit Growth of a Grafted Tumor In Vivo: Proof of Concept|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152885|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e0152885|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152885|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; which shows the possibility of acting on a tumor grafted subcutaneously in the rodent by applying a constraint.	

It is validated in this Proof of Concept. There is a significant difference between the treated group and the control groups. This difference concerns the volume of the tumor measured in vivo which is very significantly decreased (p = 0.015) in the treated group compared to the 3 control groups (with particles and without gradient, with gradient and without particles, without gradient or particles). There is also a significant difference in favor of the treated group when measuring the surface of the living tumor, ex vivo, on digitized histological sections (p = 0.001).

This field imposed on the ECM is superimposed on that already present in the tumor tissue. Note the difference with in vitro: there is no confinement by the ECM in vitro or anchoring by the integrins which ensure the physical continuity between the ECM and the tumor tissue and thus allow the propagation to distance of mechanical signals.

In this perspective the "field of stress" becomes the therapeutic agent.

This stress is exerted via ferric nanoparticles, therefore magnetizable, located around the tumor (and not in the tumor) and subjected from outside the animal to a magnetic field gradient generated by fixed magnets. The nanoparticles then act as '‘BioActuators’ transforming part of the magnetic energy into mechanical energy.

To this work we can link the European project "Imaging Force of Cancer" which as its name indicates aims to measure, [[voxel]] by voxel, the constraints involved within the tumoral tissue. This program focuses on the breast, the primitive liver and the brain.

This project is based on MRI elastography, which is the reference method for in vivo, in situ and non-perturbative measurement of the strain, that is to say the very small elastic strain caused in the tissue will give access to the measure of "stress" that is to say of the constraint. It should therefore make it possible to construct the stress tensor of the tumor tissue in vivo, in situ, without significant disturbance intra-tumoral, obligatory starting base to hope to modify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/199748_fr.html|title=Commission européenne : CORDIS : Projets et résultats : Imaging the Force of Cancer|website=cordis.europa.eu|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serwane|first=Friedhelm|last2=Mongera|first2=Alessandro|last3=Rowghanian|first3=Payam|last4=Kealhofer|first4=David A.|last5=Lucio|first5=Adam A.|last6=Hockenbery|first6=Zachary M.|last7=Campàs|first7=Otger|date=2017|title=In vivo quantification of spatially-varying mechanical properties in developing tissues|journal=Nature Methods|volume=14|issue=2|pages=181–186|doi=10.1038/nmeth.4101|issn=1548-7091|pmc=5524219|pmid=27918540|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariappan|first=Yogesh K|last2=Glaser|first2=Kevin J|last3=Ehman|first3=Richard L|date=2010|title=MAGNETIC RESONANCE ELASTOGRAPHY: A REVIEW|journal=Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)|volume=23|issue=5|pages=497–511|doi=10.1002/ca.21006|issn=0897-3806|pmc=3066083|pmid=20544947|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hal-univ-diderot.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/560381/filename/benoit_Larrat_-_final.pdf|title=Méthodes de quantification des déplacements en Imagerie par Résonance Magnétique et leurs applications pour la caractérisation mécanique des tissus mous et le guidage de la thérapie par ultrasons focalisés (Doctoral dissertation, Paris 7).|last=Larrat|first=Benoît|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an in vivo experiment which demonstrates the increase of the signals coming from the integrins, induced by the increase of the rigidity of the matrix&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-11-25|title=Matrix Crosslinking Forces Tumor Progression by Enhancing Integrin Signaling|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867409013531|journal=Cell|language=en|volume=139|issue=5|pages=891–906|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.10.027|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The isolated cell ==

=== Micropatterning ===
The cellular patterning allowed to show the dependence of the cellular architecture on the tensions generated by the support, variable according to the rigidity of these supports. This made it possible to hypothesize about the transmission of mechanical signals between the "outside", here the support (glass then plastic then gel), and the [[Cytoskeleton|CytoSKeleton]] (CSK) and the nucleus.

The equilibrium, in the CSK of each cell, is between contractile microfilaments and microtubules resistant to compression; it is also done in the membership of the ECM by a game of pressure and tension that cancel out in a situation of equilibrium. Energy is given by actin.

Micropatterning has clearly shown these phenomena on the scale of a cell fixed on a support.

Increased stiffness of the ECM: the spreading of the cell - on the support, representation of the ECM - is necessary for the cell division (thus the growth).

Decrease of the rigidity of the ECM: when the ECM is deformed, the cell traction causes the stop of the growth and a differentiation of the cell or an apoptosis.

The soft material that transmits the mechanical signals is therefore pre-stressed and this allows the transmission of forces in the body with a quantitative distribution according to the scale: the skeleton, a macroscopic structure, will transmit much greater forces than an isolated organ.

On the scale of a tissue of an organ, the entire mechanical signal transmission network, including integrins, cadherins, focal adhesions (all intercellular junctions and ETM / cells), membrane, CSK, etc. also support the production of energy. Indeed, mitochondria are an integral part of this network and semi-solid (non-liquid) phase biochemistry is an important part of tissue metabolism.

Here we find a principle of treatment by the mechanical signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingber|first=Donald E.|date=2006-05-01|title=Cellular mechanotransduction: putting all the pieces together again|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/20/7/811|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=7|pages=811–827|doi=10.1096/fj.05-5424rev|issn=0892-6638|pmid=16675838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engler|first=Adam J.|last2=Griffin|first2=Maureen A.|last3=Sen|first3=Shamik|last4=Bönnemann|first4=Carsten G.|last5=Sweeney|first5=H.

=== The circulating cell ===
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are isolable and their rigidity can be measured quite easily. Numerous articles have been able to verify what was already known for cells in 2D culture: the Young's modulus of CTC is very strongly correlated with the severity of cancer in all its parameters: differentiation, metastatic potential, prognostic and predictive correlation...

And these correlations are valid for metaplastic, dysplastic, in situ and cancerous cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The journey of the metastatic cell ===
These CTCs must first cross the ECM, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels, and then leave the circulation to attach to a tissue for metastasis. Many articles have recently commented on this "journey" and the many physical elements that punctuate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjay|last2=Weaver|first2=Valerie M.|date=2009-06-01|title=Mechanics, malignancy, and metastasis: The force journey of a tumor cell|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10555-008-9173-4|journal=Cancer and Metastasis Reviews|language=en|volume=28|issue=1-2|pages=113–127|doi=10.1007/s10555-008-9173-4|issn=0167-7659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-8032-8_20|title=Cancer Biology and the Nuclear Envelope|last=Denais|first=Celine|last2=Lammerding|first2=Jan|date=2014|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781489980311|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|pages=435–470|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-8032-8_20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irons|first=Linda|last2=Xie|first2=Leike|last3=Owen|first3=Markus|last4=Hill|first4=Michael A.|last5=Martinez-Lemus|first5=Luis A.|last6=Glinski|first6=Olga|last7=Glinsky|first7=Vladislav V.|last8=O’Dea|first8=Reuben|last9=Brook|first9=Bindi|date=2017-04-01|title=Utilization of mechano-biological models to predict cell adhesion interactions between bone marrow endothelial cells and breast cancer cells.|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/31/1_Supplement/860.1|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=31|issue=1 Supplement|pages=860.1–860.1|issn=0892-6638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The different components of the constraint ==
The tumor accumulates mechanical energy during its growth. In an article by Stylianopoulos, the author uses a simple technique to highlight tumor constraints: an ex vivo tumor laser cutting frees the accumulated constraints. They are expressed as bulges that can be measured and related to the underlying stress. In the center of the tumor the radial and circumferential stresses are compressive; in the periphery of the tumor the [[radial stress]] is compressive, and the circumferential stress is a linear traction along the outer limit of the tumor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stylianopoulos|first=Triantafyllos|date=2017-02-01|title=The Solid Mechanics of Cancer and Strategies for Improved Therapy|url=http://biomechanical.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2571659|journal=Journal of Biomechanical Engineering|volume=139|issue=2|page=021004|doi=10.1115/1.4034991|issn=0148-0731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumor growth causes stress on the healthy tissues around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actucancerpancreas.blogspot.fr/2017/03/cancer-les-cellules-sous-pression-par.html|title=Cancer : les cellules sous pression, par Emmanuel Farge de l'Institut Curie|website=actucancerpancreas.blogspot.fr|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ExtraCellular Matrix (ECM) and the cells in contact with the ECM exert mutual tensions.

The cells of the tumor tissue exert tensions between themselves.

This results in a change in fluid flow in the tumor with an increase in intratumoral interstitial pressure.

The internal tension present in the excised tumor can be called "residual stress": when we cut it we clearly see an expansion of the volume which shows this residual tension.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Thorsten M.|last2=Münster|first2=Stefan|last3=Bonakdar|first3=Navid|last4=Butler|first4=James P.|last5=Fabry|first5=Ben|date=2012-03-30|title=3D Traction Forces in Cancer Cell Invasion|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033476|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e33476|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0033476|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another track was opened by J Fredberg, in two dimensions:
[[File:Changement d'architecture histologique.png|center|521x521px]]

As the intercellular adhesion stress increases, there is a histological architecture change and a solid to liquid phase transition.

The mechanical energy, cellular cohesion of the tumor tissue, is attributable, in large part, intercellular junctions and can be expressed in linear traction that has two components:
* Contraction energy in red, positive, which comes from the CSK and which minimizes the intercellular surface (Euclidian, pseudo solid when it dominates);
* Energy of adhesion, in white, negative and which maximizes the surface (fractal, pseudo liquid when it dominates).

== Soft matter ==
Popularized by Pierre Gilles de Gennes the term soft matter refers to the study of materials between solid and liquid; at ambient temperature, that of biology, thermal energy (kT) is of the same order of magnitude as the interaction energies between the various components. Due to this [[entropy]] / [[enthalpy]] balance these biological systems can be organized in a radically different way under the influence of small variations of the outside.

The physics of PO is a soft matter physics.

== The stress tensor ==
This is the generalization of the concept of constraint field. It summarizes in a mathematical expression all the pressures involved in a volume. Here, it is the volume of the tumor with a solid sphere, the tumor tissue, predominantly viscoelastic and a hollow sphere, the ECM, predominantly elastic. The solid sphere is embedded in the hollow sphere.

== Organization of CSK and continuity of structures transmitting mechanical signals ==
The mechanical signals travel through the organs, without any break in continuity. At the tissue level, it is the connective tissue or the ECM that ensures this continuity. At the cellular level, it is the continuity between the connective tissue, the cell membrane, the CSK and the nucleus that ensures this transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alippi|first=A.|last2=Bettucci|first2=A.|last3=Biagioni|first3=A.|last4=Conclusio|first4=D.|last5=D'Orazio|first5=A.|last6=Germano|first6=M.|last7=Passeri|first7=D.|date=2012-05-24|title=Non linear behaviour of cell tensegrity models|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3703199|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1433|issue=1|pages=329–332|doi=10.1063/1.3703199|issn=0094-243X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ning|last2=Tytell|first2=Jessica D.|last3=Ingber|first3=Donald E.|date=2009|title=Mechanotransduction at a distance: mechanically coupling the extracellular matrix with the nucleus|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrm2594|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|language=En|volume=10|issue=1|pages=75–82|doi=10.1038/nrm2594|issn=1471-0080|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hitherto dominant approach is the "bottom up": the understanding of the biological mechanisms (mechanoreceptors, actin and other components of CSK, intracellular signaling, gene effectors, etc.) must lead to an understanding of the phenomena at scale, above be here mesoscopic, tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pegoraro|first=Adrian F.|last2=Fredberg|first2=Jeffrey J.|last3=Park|first3=Jin-Ah|title=Problems in biology with many scales of length: Cell–cell adhesion and cell jamming in collective cellular migration|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014482715301385|journal=Experimental Cell Research|volume=343|issue=1|pages=54–59|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2015.10.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are success stories of this approach when one can identify a faulty gene with a mutation and it is possible to act by a drug on the outcome of the mutation: a receptor or an enzyme.

This "one-to-one and first-degree equation" allowed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia to be controlled by imatinib. The defective BCR-ABL gene makes it possible to manufacture an abnormal version of an enzyme of the Tyrosine Kinase type present in leukemic cells. Imatinib inhibits this enzyme and the manufacture of these cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawyers|first=Charles L.|date=1999-04-29|title=Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199904293401706|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=340|issue=17|pages=1330–1340|doi=10.1056/nejm199904293401706|issn=0028-4793|pmid=10219069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Jason R.|last2=Carta|first2=Luca|last3=Bénard|first3=Ludovic|last4=Chemaly|first4=Elie R.|last5=Chiu|first5=Emily|last6=Rao|first6=Satish K.|last7=Hampton|first7=Thomas G.|last8=Yurchenco|first8=Peter|last9=Costa|first9=Kevin D.|date=2014-03-03|title=Abnormal muscle mechanosignaling triggers cardiomyopathy in mice with Marfan syndrome|url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/71059|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|language=en|volume=124|issue=3|doi=10.1172/jci71059|issn=0021-9738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These few exceptions have led one to believe that this reasoning could be applied to cancers as a whole.

But the "equation" of cancer is much more complex. And the massive failure of "targeted therapies" to cure cancer is the illustration. These targeted therapies have cured only 50% of HER2 positive breast cancers treated with adjuvant therapy after local cancer treatment. That is 3% of breast cancers. That's all. Moreover, their participation in the "chronicization" of the breast and prostate - even some colon or rectum - is very minor compared to chemo / hormonotherapy, much better used today.

The other approach, "top down", takes into account the emergence of unpredictable phenomena through the reductionist approach. Thus, the experimental evidence showing that carcinogenesis is a process bound to emerge a break geometry of the tissue architecture requires abandoning the genetic level or above genetics to get into systems biology and put the matter to cell/tissue level.

In fact, cell phenotypes are emergent phenomena that result from intercellular nonlinear interactions and interaction with the environment that is to say the ECM. This is usually described in a phase space where attractors dot the landscape and are points of stability or instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dinicola|first=Simona|last2=D'Anselmi|first2=Fabrizio|last3=Pasqualato|first3=Alessia|last4=Proietti|first4=Sara|last5=Lisi|first5=Elisabetta|last6=Cucina|first6=Alessandra|last7=Bizzarri|first7=Mariano|date=2011-02-14|title=A Systems Biology Approach to Cancer: Fractals, Attractors, and Nonlinear Dynamics|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/omi.2010.0091|journal=OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=93–104|doi=10.1089/omi.2010.0091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fractality ==
The cancer is fractal and this in all its components and at different scales micro/meso and macroscopic.

== The death of the patient ==
What is a cancer patient dying of?

There are several possibilities: the infectious complications related to the immunodepression due to the disease and the treatments, the attack of a vital organ like the lungs invaded by so many metastases that the breathing becomes impossible, the thrombotic complications like a pulmonary embolism, an end of life precipitated by analgesic treatments whose doses are increased. But behind all these causes is the diversion of energy by cancer that behaves like a parasite that kills its host. In some particularly local cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, this is particularly noticeable: the patient dies of cachexia, that is to say of great malnutrition.

== The big ancestors and the dust under the carpet ==
The brilliant intuitions of D'Arcy Thompson are now accepted by all: the shape that organs (including cancer) and organisms take depends on the variations in time and space of the mechanical properties of the tissues. But he describes, without making any assumptions about why and how.

J Wolff described the histological variations of the bone according to the load which weighs on him.

This is well known to thoracic surgeons: a vein removed to bypass a coronary artery and grafted into the artery position changes histology and becomes an artery due to this new pressure regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783642710339|title=The Law of Bone Remodelling {{!}} Julius Wolff {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ongrowthform1917thom|title=On growth and form|last=Thompson|first=D'Arcy Wentworth|date=1917|publisher=Cambridge [Eng.] University press|others=MBLWHOI Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Jafna L.|last2=Chiasson|first2=David A.|last3=Gotlieb|first3=Avrum I.|title=Stranger in a strange land: The pathogenesis of saphenous vein graft stenosis with emphasis on structural and functional differences between veins and arteries|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/003306209190019I|journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|volume=34|issue=1|pages=45–68|doi=10.1016/0033-0620(91)90019-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same conclusion can be drawn from studies on the transformation of bone and cartilage tissue under different pressure regimes.

Since the 50's of the 20th century, the genetic paradigm has emerged. Cancers arise from one (or some) mutated cell(s) and progression results from the sequential accumulation of tumor-free random mutations of all homeostatic controls.

The discovery of oncogenes, suppressor genes, stability genes (caretaker) is a coherent and reliable set to track the birth and progression of cancer.

But the contradictory experimental facts are not lacking: the carcinogens are not all mutagens (hormones...); the target of carcinogens may be the ECM and not the cell; an ECM exposed to a carcinogen brought into contact with a non-cancerous tissue will cause cancer of this tissue, but not vice versa; a cancerous tissue in close contact with a normal ECM may become normal tissue again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maffini|first=Maricel V.|last2=Soto|first2=Ana M.|last3=Calabro|first3=Janine M.|last4=Ucci|first4=Angelo A.|last5=Sonnenschein|first5=Carlos|date=2004-03-15|title=The stroma as a crucial target in rat mammary gland carcinogenesis|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/117/8/1495|journal=Journal of Cell Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=8|pages=1495–1502|doi=10.1242/jcs.01000|issn=0021-9533|pmid=14996910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barcellos-Hoff|first=Mary Helen|last2=Ravani|first2=Shraddha A.|date=2000-03-01|title=Irradiated Mammary Gland Stroma Promotes the Expression of Tumorigenic Potential by Unirradiated Epithelial Cells|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/60/5/1254|journal=Cancer Research|language=en|volume=60|issue=5|pages=1254–1260|issn=0008-5472|pmid=10728684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These last examples plead for the reality of the possible reversion of the cancerous to the non-cancerous.

Finally, more cancers are due to infectious "causes" than to genetic "causes".

These last examples plead for the reality of the possible reversion of the cancerous to the non-cancerous.

== Towards a global approach to cancer ==
Any theory of carcinogenesis must explain cancerization since its onset, dysplasia, in situ, then crossing of the basement membrane, the growth of the primary tumor and the appearance of metastases.

Let us quote DW Smithers (1962): "cancer is no more a disease of the cells than a traffic jam is a disease of cars".

We therefore see a global approach taking into account both the mechanical and biological signals in this long process that goes from dysplasia to metastases.

This new branch of biology has consequences beyond oncology, in embryology, tissue engineering, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Callie Johnson|last2=Davidson|first2=Lance A.|date=2013|title=The interplay between cell signalling and mechanics in developmental processes|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg3513|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=14|issue=10|pages=733–744|doi=10.1038/nrg3513|issn=1471-0064|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mammoto|first=Tadanori|last2=Ingber|first2=Donald E.|date=2010-05-01|title=Mechanical control of tissue and organ development|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/137/9/1407|journal=Development|language=en|volume=137|issue=9|pages=1407–1420|doi=10.1242/dev.024166|issn=0950-1991|pmid=20388652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorne|first=Jeffrey T.|last2=Segal|first2=Thalia R.|last3=Chang|first3=Sydney|last4=Jorge|first4=Soledad|last5=Segars|first5=James H.|last6=Leppert|first6=Phyllis C.|date=2015-01-01|title=Dynamic Reciprocity Between Cells and Their Microenvironment in Reproduction1|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/92/1/25,%201-10/2434045|journal=Biology of Reproduction|language=en|volume=92|issue=1|doi=10.1095/biolreprod.114.121368|issn=0006-3363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pokorný|first=Jiří|last2=Foletti|first2=Alberto|last3=Kobilková|first3=Jitka|last4=Jandová|first4=Anna|last5=Vrba|first5=Jan|last6=Vrba|first6=Jan|last7=Nedbalová|first7=Martina|last8=Čoček|first8=Aleš|last9=Danani|first9=Andrea|date=2013|title=Biophysical Insights into Cancer Transformation and Treatment|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/195028/|journal=The Scientific World Journal|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1–11|doi=10.1155/2013/195028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The success of physics in "mathematicizing" itself, particularly since [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica (Newton)|Principia Mathematica]]'', is generally considered remarkable and often disproportionate compared to other areas of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Eugene Wigner]] remarked "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve.", while [[Richard Feynman]] said "To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."&lt;/ref&gt; "Physics envy" refers to the envy (perceived or real) of scholars in other disciplines for the mathematical precision of fundamental concepts obtained by physicists. It is an accusation raised against disciplines (typically against [[social sciences]] and [[liberal art]]s such as [[literature]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]]) when these academic areas try to express their fundamental concepts in terms of mathematics, which is seen as an unwarranted push for [[reductionism]].

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Ernst Mayr]] discusses the issue of the inability to reduce biology to its mathematical basis in his book ''What Makes Biology Unique?''.&lt;ref name="Mayr2004"&gt;Mayr (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] discusses the ability and desirability of reduction to its mathematical basis in his article "Mysteries of Nature: How Deeply Hidden."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky contributed extensively to the development of the field of [[theoretical linguistics]], a [[formal science]].

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''pulverizer''' or '''grinder''' is a mechanical device for the grinding of many different types of materials. For example, a pulverizer mill is used to [[Pulverized coal-fired boiler|pulverize coal]] for [[combustion]] in the steam-generating [[furnaces]] of [[fossil fuel power plant]]s.

==Types of coal pulverizers==
Coal pulverizers may be classified by speed, as follows:&lt;ref name="CPMT-GS"&gt;Coal Pulverising Mill Types, by Glenn Schumacher, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low Speed
* Medium Speed
* High Speed

===Low Speed===

====Ball and tube mills====

A ball mill is a pulverizer that consists of a horizontal rotating cylinder, up to three diameters in length, containing a charge of tumbling or cascading steel balls, pebbles, or rods.

A tube mill is a revolving cylinder of up to five diameters in length used for fine pulverization of [[ore]], rock, and other such materials; the material, mixed with water, is fed into the chamber from one end, and passes out the other end as a [[slurry]].

Both types of mill include liners that protect the cylindrical structure of the mill from wear.  Thus the main wear parts in these mills are the balls themselves, and the liners.  The balls are simply "consumed" by the wear process and must be re-stocked, whereas the liners must be periodically replaced.

The ball and tube mills are low-speed machines that grind the coal with steel balls in a rotating horizontal cylinder. Due to its shape, it is called a tube mill and due to use of grinding balls for crushing, it is called a ball mill, or both terms as a ball tube mill..

These mills are also designated as an example size, BBD-4772,

*B – Broyer (Name of inventor).
*B – Boulet (French word for balls).
*D – Direct firing.
*47 – Diameter of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 4.7&amp;nbsp;m diameter.
*72 – Length of shell (in decimeters) i.e. 7.2&amp;nbsp;m length.

The grinding in the ball and tube mill is produced by the rotating quantity of steel balls by their fall and lift due to tube rotation. The ball charge may occupy one third to half of the total internal volume of the shell. The significant feature incorporated in the BBD mills is its double end operation, each end catering to one elevation of a boiler. The system facilitated entry of raw coal and exit of pulverized fuel from same end simultaneously. This helps in reducing the number of installations per unit.

====Mill construction details====
A ball tube mill may be described as a cylinder made of steel plates having separate heads or trunions attached to the ends with each trunion resting on suitable bearings for supporting the machine. The trunions are hollow to allow for the introduction of discharge of the materials undergoing reduction in size. The mill shell is lined with chilled iron, carbon steel, manganese steel, or high chrome liners attached to shell body with counter sunk bolts. These liners are made in different shapes so that the counter inside surface of the mill is suited for requirement of a particular application.

The shells are of three pieces. The intermediate shell connects to the end shells by flange joints and the total length of shell is 7.2&amp;nbsp;m. The liners are fastened to the inner side of mill shell (cylindrical part) to protect the shell from the impact of the steel balls. There are 600 liners of ten variants in each shell weighing 60.26&amp;nbsp;tonnes. The original lift value of the liners is 55&amp;nbsp;mm. and the minimum lift allowed is 20&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Operation====
The primary air input to a ball tube mill performs a dual function. It is used for drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the pulverized fuel outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.

In order to avoid excess sweeping of coal from the mill, only part of the primary air, directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of pulverized fuel to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the primary air duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the pulverized fuel from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.

The tube mill output (responding to boiler load demand) is controlled by regulating the primary air-flow. This regulation, by sweeping pulverized fuel from the mill, is very fast; comparable with oil firing response, but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls the speed of the raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of pulverized fuel to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.

The mill is pressurized and the air-tightness is ensured by plenum chambers around the rotating trunnion filled with pressurized seal air. Bleeding seal air from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill and the outside atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of seal air will allow escape of pulverized fuel into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of seal air leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature. As such the seal air is controlled by a local control damper maintaining just sufficient differential pressure for sealing.

===Medium Speed===

====Ring and ball mill====

This type of mill consists of two types of rings separated by a series of large balls, like a [[thrust bearing]].  The lower ring rotates, while the upper ring presses down on the balls via a set of spring and adjuster assemblies, or pressurised rams. The material to be pulverized is introduced into the center or side of the pulverizer (depending on the design). As the lower ring rotates, the balls to orbit between the upper and lower rings, and balls roll over the bed of coal on the lower ring. The pulverized material is carried out of the mill by the flow of air moving through it. The size of the pulverized particles released from the grinding section of the mill is determined by a classifier separator. If the coal is fine enough to be picked up by the air, it is carried through the classifier. Coarser particles return to be further pulverized.

===Vertical spindle roller mill===

Similar to the ring and ball mill, the vertical spindle roller mill uses large "tires" to crush the coal. These mills are usually found in utility plants.

Raw coal is gravity-fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal action and is ground between the rollers and table. Hot primary air for drying and coal
transport enters the windbox plenum underneath the grinding table and flows upward through a swirl ring having multiple sloped nozzles surrounding the grinding table. The air mixes with and
dries coal in the grinding zone and carries pulverized coal particles upward into a classifier.

Fine pulverized coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes leading to the burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected and returned to the grinding zone for further grinding.
Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.
Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.
The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.

Depending on the required coal fineness, there are two types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage, is capable of producing [[micrometre|micrometer]]-fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size distribution. In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher &lt;50 mesh and 80% or higher &lt;200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% &lt;100 mesh and 95% &lt;200 mesh, or better.

In 1954 a '''Jet Pulverizer''' was developed in which operates like a Vertical Pulverizer only the item is pulverized by the high speed air action. For example, forcing coal against coal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Jet Pulverizer."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bowl mill===
Similar to the vertical roller mill, it also uses tires to crush coal. There are two types, a deep bowl mill, and a shallow bowl mill.

===High Speed===

==Basics==
A classical computer has a [[Computer memory|memory]] made up of [[bit]]s, where each bit is represented by either a one or a zero. A quantum computer, on the other hand, maintains a sequence of [[qubit]]s, which can represent a one, a zero, or any [[quantum superposition]] of those two [[Qubit#Qubit states|qubit states]];&lt;ref name=nielchuan&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|last3=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-107-00217-3|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|author-link=Michael A. Nielsen|author-link2=Isaac Chuang|title-link=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–16}} a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states,&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|16}} and three qubits in any superposition of 8 states. In general, a quantum computer with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; different states simultaneously.&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|17}} (This compares to a normal computer that can only be in ''one'' of these &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; states at any one time).

A quantum computer operates on its qubits using [[quantum gate]]s and [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] (which also alters the observed state). An [[quantum algorithm|algorithm]] is composed of a fixed sequence of [[quantum gate|quantum logic gates]] and a problem is encoded by setting the initial values of the qubits, similar to how a classical computer works. The calculation usually ends with a measurement, collapsing the system of qubits into one of the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; eigenstates, where each qubit is zero or one, decomposing into a classical state. The outcome can, therefore, be at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; classical bits of information (or, if the algorithm did not end with a measurement, the result is an unobserved quantum state).

Quantum algorithms are often probabilistic, in that they provide the correct solution only with a certain known probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/chap5_15.pdf|title=Lecture Notes for Ph219/CS219: Quantum Information Chapter 5|last=Preskill|first=John|date=2015|website=|publisher=|page=12|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the term non-deterministic computing must not be used in that case to mean probabilistic (computing) because the term [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] has a different meaning in computer science.

An example of an implementation of qubits of a quantum computer could start with the use of particles with two [[spin (physics)|spin]] states: "down" and "up" (typically written &lt;math&gt;|{\downarrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;|0{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;). This is true because any such system can be mapped onto an effective [[Spin-½|spin-1/2]] system.

A quantum computer with a given number of qubits is fundamentally different from a classical computer composed of the same number of classical bits. For example, representing the state of an ''n''-qubit system on a classical computer requires the storage of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Complex number|complex]] coefficients, while to characterize the state of a classical ''n''-bit system it is sufficient to provide the values of the ''n'' bits, that is, only ''n'' numbers. Although this fact may seem to indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical counterparts, care must be taken not to overlook the fact that the qubits are only in a probabilistic superposition of all of their states.  This means that when the final state of the qubits is measured, they will only be found in one of the possible configurations they were in before the measurement.  It is generally incorrect to think of a system of qubits as being in one particular state before the measurement. Since the fact that they were in a superposition of states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes of the computation.

[[File:Quantum computer.svg|thumb|200px|Qubits are made up of controlled particles and the means of control (e.g. devices that trap particles and switch them from one state to another).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]] |place = London |year = 2007 |page = 157 |isbn = 978-2-7462-1516-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

To better understand this point, consider a classical computer that operates on a three-bit [[Processor register|register]]. If the exact state of the register at a given time is not known, it can be described as a probability distribution over the &lt;math&gt;2^3=8&lt;/math&gt; different three-bit strings &lt;tt&gt;000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;. If there is no uncertainty over its state, then it is in exactly one of these states with probability 1. However, if it is a [[Probabilistic Turing machine|probabilistic computer]], then there is a possibility of it being in any ''one'' of a number of different states.

The state of a three-qubit quantum computer is similarly described by an [[Eight-dimensional space|eight-dimensional vector]] &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; (or a one dimensional vector with
each vector node holding the amplitude and the state as the bit string of qubits). Here, however, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[complex number]]s, and it is the sum of the ''squares'' of the coefficients' [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute values]], &lt;math&gt;\sum_i |a_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;, that must equal 1. For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the absolute value squared &lt;math&gt;\left|a_i \right|^2&lt;/math&gt; gives the probability of the system being found in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th state after a measurement. However, because a complex number encodes not just a magnitude but also a direction in the [[complex plane]], the phase difference between any two coefficients (states) represents a meaningful parameter. This is a fundamental difference between quantum computing and probabilistic classical computing.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255–261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you measure the three qubits, you will observe a three-bit string. The probability of measuring a given string is the squared magnitude of that string's coefficient (i.e., the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_0|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_1|^2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). Thus, measuring a quantum state described by complex coefficients &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; gives the classical probability distribution &lt;math&gt;(|a_0|^2,|a_1|^2,|a_2|^2,|a_3|^2,|a_4|^2,|a_5|^2,|a_6|^2,|a_7|^2)&lt;/math&gt; and we say that the quantum state "collapses" to a classical state as a result of making the measurement.

An eight-dimensional vector can be specified in many different ways depending on what [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] is chosen for the space. The basis of bit strings (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt;, …, &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;) is known as the computational basis. Other possible bases are [[unit vector|unit-length]], [[orthogonal]] vectors and the eigenvectors of the [[Pauli matrices|Pauli-x operator]]. [[Bra-ket notation|Ket notation]] is often used to make the choice of basis explicit. For example, the state &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; in the computational basis can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;a_0\,|000\rangle + a_1\,|001\rangle + a_2\,|010\rangle + a_3\,|011\rangle + a_4\,|100\rangle + a_5\,|101\rangle + a_6\,|110\rangle + a_7\,|111\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:where, e.g., &lt;math&gt;| 010\rangle = \left(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The computational basis for a single qubit (two dimensions) is &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle = \left(1,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle = \left(0,1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the eigenvectors of the Pauli-x operator, a single qubit is &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

While a classical 3-bit state and a quantum 3-qubit state are each eight-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vectors]], they are manipulated quite differently for classical or quantum computation. For computing in either case, the system must be initialized, for example into the all-zeros string, &lt;math&gt;|000\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the vector (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). In classical randomized computation, the system evolves according to the application of [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]], which preserve that the probabilities add up to one (i.e., preserve the [[Taxicab geometry|L1 norm]]). In quantum computation, on the other hand, allowed operations are [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]], which are effectively rotations (they preserve that the sum of the squares add up to one, the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean or L2 norm]]). (Exactly what unitaries can be applied depend on the physics of the quantum device.) Consequently, since rotations can be undone by rotating backward, quantum computations are [[Reversible computing|reversible]]. (Technically, quantum operations can be probabilistic combinations of unitaries, so quantum computation really does generalize classical computation. See [[quantum circuit]] for a more precise formulation.)

Finally, upon termination of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In the case of a classical computer, we ''sample'' from the [[probability distribution]] on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one ''[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measures]]'' the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, [[counterfactual quantum computation]] allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.

For more details on the sequences of operations used for various [[quantum algorithm]]s, see [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].

=== Cryptography ===
[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101–128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie–Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

However, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.&lt;ref name="pqcrypto_survey"&gt;Daniel J.

[[Quantum cryptography]] could potentially fulfill some of the functions of public key cryptography. Quantum-based cryptographic systems could ,therefore, be more secure than traditional systems against quantum hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-computing-explained|title=What are quantum computers and how do they work?

=== Quantum search ===

Besides factorization and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms offering a more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ Quantum Algorithm Zoo] – Stephen Jordan's Homepage&lt;/ref&gt; including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of [[Jones polynomial]]s, and solving [[Pell's equation]]. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jon Schiller, Phd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l217ma2sWkoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathematical%20proof&amp;f=false 
|title=Quantum Computers|isbn=9781439243497 
|date=2009-06-19 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup. The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.

Problems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:
#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer

For problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1804.00200|doi=10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090354 |title=The Impact of Quantum Computing on Present Cryptography |journal=International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=March 2018 |last1=Mavroeidis |first1=Vasileios |last2=Vishi |first2=Kamer |last3=d |first3=Mateusz |last4=Jøsang |first4=Audun }}&lt;/ref&gt; This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum simulation ===
Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimisation ===
[[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly evolved to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process.

=== Solving linear equations ===
The [[Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]] or "HHL Algorithm", named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is expected to provide speedup over classical counterparts.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0811.3171|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|last2 = Hassidim|first2 = Avinatan|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|title = Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 103|issue = 15|pages = 150502|year = 2008|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid = 19905613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum supremacy ===

== Obstacles ==
There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer, and thus far quantum computers have yet to solve a problem faster than a classical computer. [[David P. DiVincenzo|David DiVincenzo]], of IBM, listed the following [[DiVincenzo's criteria|requirements]] for a practical quantum computer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=quant-ph/0002077|title=The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation|last=DiVincenzo |first=David P.|date=2000-04-13|doi=10.1002/1521-3978(200009)48:9/11&lt;771::AID-PROP771&gt;3.0.CO;2-E|volume=48|issue=9–11|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|pages=771–783|bibcode=2000ForPh..48..771D}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Another Obstacle that a Quantum Systems can face is that they need to be contained and isolated. This is because there can be outside factors that can interfere with a Quantum Computer performance, this it called the Decoherence effects.

*scalable physically to increase the number of qubits;
*qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values;
*quantum gates that are faster than [[decoherence]] time;

*qubits that can be read easily.

=== Quantum decoherence ===
{{Main|Quantum decoherence}}

One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995" /&gt; Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286–288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; bits without error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

Zaslavsky | arxiv=quant-ph/0610117|bibcode=2006quant.ph.10117D }}&lt;/ref&gt; With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bits. Computation time is about ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; steps and at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, about 10 seconds.

A very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable logic gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Developments ==
=== Quantum computing models ===
There are a number of quantum computing models, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed. The four main models of practical importance are:
* [[quantum circuit|Quantum gate array]] (computation decomposed into a sequence of few-qubit [[quantum gate]]s)
* [[One-way quantum computer]] (computation decomposed into a sequence of one-qubit measurements applied to a highly entangled initial state or [[cluster state]])
* [[Adiabatic quantum computation|Adiabatic quantum computer]], based on [[quantum annealing]] (computation decomposed into a slow continuous transformation of an initial [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |first=A. |last=Das |first2=B.

The [[quantum Turing machine]] is theoretically important but the direct implementation of this model is not pursued. All four models of computation have been shown to be equivalent; each can simulate the other with no more than polynomial overhead.

=== Physical realizations ===
For physically implementing a quantum computer, many different candidates are being pursued, among them (distinguished by the physical system used to realize the qubits):

A large number of candidates demonstrates that the topic, in spite of rapid progress, is still in its infancy. There is also a vast amount of flexibility.

=== Timeline ===
{{Main|Timeline of quantum computing}}

In 1959 [[Richard Feynman]] in his lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" states the possibility of using quantum effects for computation.

In 1980 [[Paul Benioff]] described quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of computers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benioff | first1=Paul | title = The computer as a physical system: A microscopic quantum mechanical Hamiltonian model of computers as represented by Turing machines | journal =  Journal of Statistical Physics |volume= 22 |  issue = 5 | pages =563–591 | year = 1980 | doi=10.1007/bf01011339|bibcode = 1980JSP....22..563B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian mathematician [[Yuri Manin]] motivated the development of quantum computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manin |first=Yu I |year=1980 |title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe |trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable |language=ru |work=Sov.Radio |pp=13–15 |url= http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.(1980).%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, at a conference co-organized by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and IBM, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] urged the world to build a quantum computer. He said, "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gil|first1=Dario|title=The Dawn of Quantum Computing is Upon Us|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/05/the-quantum-age-of-computing-is-here/|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[BB84]] is published, the world's first [[quantum cryptography protocol]] by IBM scientists [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]].

In 1993, an international group of six scientists, including Charles Bennett, showed that perfect [[quantum teleportation]] is possible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett,|first1=C. H.|title=Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen channels|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=29 March 1993|volume=70|issue=13|pages=1895–1899|url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bennetc/BBCJPW.pdf|bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.1895B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895|pmid=10053414}}&lt;/ref&gt; in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

In 1994 [[Peter Shor]], at AT&amp;amp;T's [[Bell Labs]] discovered an important quantum algorithm, which allows a quantum computer to factor large integers exponentially much faster than the best known classical algorithm. [[Shor's algorithm]] can theoretically break many of the [[Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptosystem]]s in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ekert |first=Artur |last2=Josza |first2=Richard |title=Quantum computation and Shor's factoring algorithm |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=733–753 |year=1996 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.68.733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its invention sparked a tremendous interest in quantum computers.

In 1996, The [[DiVincenzo's criteria]] are published which is a list of conditions that are necessary for constructing a quantum computer proposed by the theoretical physicist [[David P. DiVincenzo]] in his 2000 paper "The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation".

In 2001, researchers demonstrated [[Shor's algorithm]] to factor 15 using a 7-qubit NMR computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/414883a|title=Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance|year=2001|last1=Vandersypen|first1=Lieven M.

In 2005, researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] built a [[semiconductor chip]] [[ion trap]]. Such devices from standard [[photolithography|lithography]] may point the way to scalable quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2005/Dec05/r121205b |title= U-M develops scalable and mass-producible quantum computer chip |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2006-11-17 |date=2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers at [[Yale University]] created the first solid-state quantum processor. The two-[[qubit]] superconducting chip had artificial atom qubits made of a billion [[aluminum]] [[atom]]s that acted like a single atom that could occupy two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08121.pdf |title= Demonstration of two-qubit algorithms with a superconducting quantum processor |accessdate=2009-07-02 |last=DiCarlo |first=L. |last2=Chow |first2=J.

The first is a 16 qubit processor that will allow for more complex experimentation than the previously available 5 qubit processor. The second is IBM's first prototype commercial processor with 17 qubits and leverages significant materials, device, and architecture improvements to make it the most powerful quantum processor created to date by IBM.

In July 2017, a group of U.S. researchers announced a quantum simulator with 51 qubits. The announcement was made by Mikhail Lukin of [[Harvard University]] at the [http://conference.rqc.ru/ International Conference on Quantum Technologies] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Matt|title=Quantum simulator with 51 qubits is largest ever|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2141105-quantum-simulator-with-51-qubits-is-largest-ever/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A quantum simulator differs from a computer. Lukin’s simulator was designed to solve one equation. Solving a different equation would require building a new system. A computer can solve many different equations.

In September 2017, IBM Research scientists use a 7 qubit device to model the largest molecule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IBM Pioneers New Approach to Simulate Chemistry with Quantum Computing|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53137.wss|accessdate=13 September 2017|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium hydride, ever by a quantum computer. The results were published as the cover story in the peer-reviewed journal [http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature23879 Nature].

In October 2017, IBM Research scientists successfully "broke the 49-qubit simulation barrier" and [https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2017/10/quantum-computing-barrier/ simulated 49- and 56-qubit short-depth circuits], using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Vulcan supercomputer, and the University of Illinois' Cyclops Tensor Framework (originally developed at the University of California).

In November 2017, the University of Sydney research team in Australia successfully made a [[microwave circulator]], an important quantum computer part, 1000 times smaller than a conventional circulator by using [[topological insulators]] to slow down the speed of light in a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171128102924.htm|title=Key component for quantum computing invented: University of Sydney team develop microcircuit based on Nobel Prize research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, IBM announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IBM Announces Collaboration with Leading Fortune 500 Companies, Academic Institutions and National Research Labs to Accelerate Quantum Computing|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53483.wss|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; its first IBM Q Network clients.

== Relation to computational complexity theory ==
{{Main|Quantum complexity theory}}

[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called [[BQP]], for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run [[probabilistic algorithm]]s, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A quantum computer is said to "solve" a problem if, for every instance, its answer will be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP.

BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P&lt;sup&gt;#P&lt;/sup&gt;''),&lt;ref name=BernVazi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411–1473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].

BQP is suspected to be disjoint from [[NP-complete]] and a strict superset of [[P (complexity)|P]], but that is not known. Both [[integer factorization]] and [[discrete logarithm problem|discrete log]] are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.&lt;ref name=BernVazi /&gt;

The capacity of a quantum computer to accelerate classical algorithms has rigid limits—upper bounds of quantum computation's complexity. The overwhelming part of classical calculations cannot be accelerated on a quantum computer.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Quantum Computers Speed Up Classical with Probability Zero |year=1999 |pages=1707–1714 |volume=10 |journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals |arxiv=quant-ph/9803064 |bibcode = 1998quant.ph..3064O |doi=10.1016/S0960-0779(98)00226-4 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar fact takes place for particular computational tasks, like the search problem, for which [[Grover's algorithm]] is optimal.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Lower Bounds of Quantum Search for Extreme Point |year=1999 |pages=2165–2172 |volume=A455 |journal=Proceedings of the London Royal Society |arxiv=quant-ph/9806001 |bibcode = 1999RSPSA.455.2165O |doi = 10.1098/rspa.1999.0397 |issue=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian Mechanics]] is a non-local hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been shown that a non-local hidden variable quantum computer could implement a search of an N-item database at most in &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt[3]{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps. This is slightly faster than the &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps taken by [[Grover's algorithm]]. Neither search method will allow quantum computers to solve [[NP-completeness|NP-Complete]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qchvpra.pdf|title=Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although quantum computers may be faster than classical computers for some problem types, those described above cannot solve any problem that classical computers cannot already solve. A [[Turing machine]] can simulate &lt;!-- add mention about [[Quantum Virtual Machines]] which can simulate quantum computer on classical one --&gt;these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an [[undecidable problem]] like the [[halting problem]]. The existence of "standard" quantum computers does not disprove the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[M-theory]] or [[loop quantum gravity]], may allow even faster computers to be built. Currently, ''defining'' computation in such theories is an open problem due to the ''[[problem of time]]'', i.e., there currently exists no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Scott Aaronson]]|title=NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality|journal=ACM SIGACT News, March|volume=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0502072|year=2005|bibcode=2005quant.ph..2072A}} See section 7 "Quantum Gravity": "[…] to anyone who wants
a test or benchmark for a favorite quantum gravity theory,[author's footnote: That is, one without all the bother of making numerical predictions and comparing them to observation] let me humbly propose the following: ''can you define Quantum Gravity Polynomial-Time?'' […] until we can say what it means for a 'user' to specify an 'input' and
‘later' receive an 'output'—''there is no such thing as computation, not even theoretically.''" (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
In a study assessing an increasingly-diversified array of publishers and their service to the academic community, [[Janice S. Lewis]] concluded that college and university librarians ranked university presses higher and commercial publishers lower than did members of the [[American Political Science Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Janice S. "An assessment of publisher quality by political science librarians." College &amp; Research Libraries 61.4 (2000): 313-323&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of approaches to ranking academic book publishers;&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, Larry P., Bradford Dillman, and Anil Hira.

(2007).http://eprints.utas.edu.au/7236/1/AusPSA_RQF_final_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; rankings rely on subjective impressions by the scholarly community, on analyses of prize winners of scientific associations and a publisher's reputation and [[impact factor]] (particularly in the sciences). According to Colin Steele, a librarian at the [[Australian National Library]] in [[Canberra]], "Listings of publishers by title also fail to take into account that some university presses are strong in certain disciplines, but not across the whole spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Colin.

== {{anchor|SENSE Rankings}}SENSE rankings ==
The [[Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment]] (SENSE Research School) ranked scientific publishers in 2006.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense.nl/organisation/documentation|title=SENSE - Quality &amp; Criteria|website=www.sense.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; SENSE works in conjunction with the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW), in accordance with the standard evaluation protocol for Dutch universities. The school developed its ranking in conjunction with performance criteria for its staff. rating A, B, and C journals and A, B, C, D, and E publishers. A-publishers are ranking scheme,&lt;ref name="SENSEranking"&gt;http://www.sense.nl/gfx_content/documents/ABCDE-indeling%20Scientific%20Publishers%20SENSE_approved_May_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the "few top-notch international publishers"; B-publishers are "good international publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; C-publishers are "decent international publishers and excellent national publishers";&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; D-publishers are "professional publications published by major international organisations and good national publishers",&lt;ref name="SENSEranking" /&gt; and E-publishers are "publications mainly published for a non-academic general public by national organisations and small local publishers". The SENSE Ranking was recognized in [[bibliometric]] literature&lt;ref&gt;Zuccala, Alesia, et al. "Can we rank scholarly book publishers? A bibliometric experiment with the field of history." Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 66.7 (2015): 1333-1347; Torres-Salinas, Daniel, et al. "The BiPublishers ranking: Main results and methodological problems when constructing rankings of academic publishers." arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.01074 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities' attempts to rate publishers.&lt;ref&gt;see for example the ranking, provided by the [[Education University of Hong Kong]] https://www.ied.edu.hk/include_n/getrichfile.php?key=95030d9da8144788e3752da05358f071&amp;secid=50424&amp;filename=secstaffcorner/research_doc/Compiled_Publisher_List.pdf This "Hong Kong" ranking quotes rankings by the [[Australian Political Studies Association]]; and another publisher ranking system of the Centre for Resource Studies for Human Development (CERES) of the [[University of Utrecht]] in addition to the SENSE Ranking. The "Hong Kong" ranking emphasizes the high correlation between all these ranking attempts by explicitly stating "There was a high level of consistency in the ranking of Book Publishers among the three systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest SENSE ranking, like its previous rankings, is based on the subjective assessment of a publisher by prominent Dutch and international scientists. An [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] table is available at the school's website.&lt;ref name="SENSEdoc" /&gt;

== Spanish National Research Council rankings ==
In 2012 and 2014, the [[Spanish National Research Council]] asked 11,864 Spanish academics to name the 10 most prestigious academic publishers from over 600 international and 500 Spanish-language publishers. It received 2,731 responses, a response rate of 23.05 percent, asking them to name. Votes were counted in a complex mathematical procedure described at the ranking project's website.&lt;ref name="CSIC"&gt;http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/metodologia_2014.html and http://ilia.cchs.csic.es/SPI/prestigio_expertos_2014.php&lt;/ref&gt; The results were:

{{quote|Libcitation counts reflect judgments by librarians on the usefulness of publications for their various audiences of readers. The Libcitation measure thus resembles a citation impact measure in discriminating values of publications on a defined ground. It rewards authors whose books (or other publications) are seen by librarians as having relatively wide appeal. A book's absolute appeal can be determined simply by counting how many libraries hold it, but it can also be gauged in relation to other books in its subject class.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;}}

[[Libcitation]]s, according to the RIMS, reflect what librarians know about the prestige of publishers, the opinions of reviewers, and the reputations of authors.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

To quantitatively assess the output of a publishing company, a research group associated with the [[University of Granada]] created a methodology based on the [[Thomson-Reuters]] [[Book Citation Index]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Torres-Salinas, D., Robinson-García, N., Campanario, J.M. &amp; Delgado López-Cózar, E. (2013). Coverage, specialization and impact of scientific publishers in the Book Citation Index. Online Information Review, 38(1) and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267869924_Bibliometric_Indicators_for_Publishers_Data_processing_indicators_and_interpretation&lt;/ref&gt; The quantitative weight of the publishers is based on output data, impact (citations) and publisher profile. According to the Granada study, the 10 leading companies were [[Springer Publishing|Springer]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], [[Routledge]], [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Elsevier]], [[Nova Science Publishers]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Information Age Publishing]], [[Princeton University Press]], and [[University of California Press]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bibliotheksdienst, March 2017: 339 – 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] used six main indicators for 57 companies with data from the SENSE and the Granada studies. The study, which relied on the Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index, also used the [[Harvard Library]] ratio of books checked out to the total stock available in the catalog; the 2015 outreach of a company in typical scientific global cultures (Japan, Sweden and India); the presence of a publisher's output in international organizations such as the [[European Commission]] in Brussels (the [[ECLAS catalog]]) and the [[World Bank]], and references to the company in newspapers such as the ''[[New York Times]]''. A 2011 Tausch study analysed the library outreach of a company in the [[OCLC]] [[WorldCat]].&lt;ref&gt;Such an attempt limited to 21 companies in the field of social sciences was published in Tausch, A. (2011). On the Global Impact of Selected Social-Policy Publishers in More Than 100 Countries. Journal of Scholarly Publishing, 42(4), 476-513.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Reading for the Future''' ('''RFF''') is an international group which encourages [[literacy]] and [[Reading (activity)|reading]] through the use of [[speculative fiction]]. Some regional groups collect new and used books which are then distributed free of charge to schools and libraries. For many rural schools, this is the only way they get new books. 

RFF does not have a central organization but is rather a series of [[grassroots]] groups. Developing the Young Reader (DYR) associated with RFF in April 2000.

The '''Reich Labour Service''' (''Reichsarbeitsdienst''; RAD) was a major organisation established in [[Nazi Germany]] as an agency to help mitigate the effects of [[unemployment]] on the [[Economy of Nazi Germany|German economy]], militarise the workforce and indoctrinate it with [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology. It was the official state labour service, divided into separate sections for men and women.

From June 1935 onward, men aged between 18 and 25 may have served six months before their military service. During [[World War II]] compulsory service also included young women and the RAD developed to an [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] [[Military organization#Formation|formation]] which provided support for the [[Wehrmacht]] armed forces.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-085-19, Ostpreußen, RAD-Erntehelfer.jpg|thumb|RAD members working in the field, East Prussia, 1938]]

==Foundation==
In the course of the [[Great Depression]], the German government of the [[Weimar Republic]] under Chancellor [[Heinrich Brüning]] by [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|emergency decree]] had established the ''Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst'' ('Voluntary Labour Service', FAD) on 5 June 1931, two years before the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) ascended to national power. The state sponsored employment organisation provided services to civic and [[land improvement]] projects, from 16 July 1932 it was headed by [[Friedrich Syrup]] in the official rank of a ''[[Reichskommissar]]''. The idea of a national compulsory service was quite popular, especially in right-wing circles{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, but it had little effect on the economic situation.

The concept was adopted by [[Adolf Hitler]], who upon the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 appointed [[Konstantin Hierl]] state secretary in the Reich Ministry of Labour, responsible for FAD matters. Hierl was already a high-ranking member of the NSDAP and head of the party's labour organisation, the ''Nationalsozialistischer Arbeitsdienst'' or NSAD. Hierl developed the concept of a state labour service organisation similar to the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' army, with a view to implementing a compulsory service. Meant as an evasion of the regulations set by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], voluntariness initially was maintained after protests by the Geneva [[World Disarmament Conference]].

Hierl's rivalry with Labour Minister [[Franz Seldte]] led to the affiliation of his office as a FAD ''Reichskommissar'' with the Interior Ministry under his party fellow [[Wilhelm Frick]]. On 11 July 1934, the NSAD was renamed ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' or RAD with Hierl as its director until the end of World War II. By law issued on 26 June 1935, the RAD was re-established as an amalgamation of the many prior labour organisations formed in Germany during the Weimar Republic,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Heyck, [http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/221 "Labour Services in the Weimar Republic and their Ideological Godparents"], ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'', 2003; 38: 221-236&lt;/ref&gt; with Hierl appointed as Reich Labour Leader (''Reichsarbeitsführer'') according to the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''. With massive financial support by the German government, RAD members were to provide service for mainly military and to a lesser extent civic and agricultural construction projects. Per Reich Labor Service Act of June 26, 1935&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/rad_ges.html&lt;/ref&gt; "(1) The Reich Labor Service is an honorary service to the German people.(2) All young Germans of both sexes are obliged to serve their people in the Reich Labor Service.(3) The Reich Labor Service is to educate the German youth in the spirit of National Socialism to the national community and to the true working attitude, above all to the due respect of manual labor.(4) The Reich Labor Service is intended for the performance of charitable work.[. . .]

==Organisation==
[[File:RAD Weibliche Jugend.svg|thumb|RAD flag, Female Section]]
The RAD was divided into two major sections, one for men (''Reichsarbeitsdienst Männer - RAD/M'') and the voluntary, from 1939 compulsory, section for young women (''Reichsarbeitsdienst der weiblichen Jugend - RAD/wJ'').

The RAD was composed of 33 districts each called an ''Arbeitsgau'' (lit. Work District) similar to the ''[[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gaue]]'' subdivisions of the Nazi Party. Each of these districts was headed by an ''Arbeitsgauführer'' officer with headquarters staff and a ''Wachkompanie'' (Guard Company). Under each district were between six and eight ''Arbeitsgruppen'' (Work Groups), battalion-sized formations of 1200–1800 men. These groups were divided into six [[company (military unit)|company]]-sized RAD-Abteilung units.

Conscripted personnel had to move into labour barracks. Each rank and file RAD man was supplied with a spade and a [[Military bicycle|bicycle]]. A paramilitary uniform was implemented in 1934; beside the [[swastika]] brassard, the RAD symbol, an arm badge in the shape of an upward pointing shovel blade, was displayed on the upper left shoulder of all uniforms and great-coats worn by all personnel. Men and women had to work up to 76 hours a week.

==War==
{{see also|Bicycle infantry#World Wars}}
The RAD was classed as ''Wehrmachtgefolge'' (lit. Defence Force Following). Auxiliary forces with this status, while not a part of the Armed Forces themselves, provided such vital support that they were given protection by the [[Geneva Convention]]. Some, including the RAD, were militarised.

Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, nearly all the RAD/M's extant RAD-Abteilung units were either incorporated into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'s ''Bautruppen'' (Construction troops) as an expedient to rapidly increase their numbers or else in a few cases transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] to form the basis of [[Luftwaffe construction units|new wartime construction units]] for that service. New units were quickly formed to replace them. 

During the early war Norwegian and Western campaigns, hundreds of RAD units were engaged in supplying frontline troops with food and ammunition, repairing damaged roads and constructing and repairing airstrips. Throughout the course of the war, the RAD were involved in many projects.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=55}} The RAD units constructed coastal fortifications (many RAD men worked on the [[Atlantic Wall]]), laid minefields, manned fortifications, and even helped guard vital locations and prisoners.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28335, RAD-Flak, Ausheben eines Schützengrabens.jpg|thumb|RAD members digging a trench for a RAD [[flak]] battery in March 1945]]

The role of the RAD was not limited to combat support functions. Hundreds of RAD units received training as anti-aircraft units and were deployed as RAD [[Flak]] Batteries.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=55}} Several RAD units also performed combat on the eastern front as infantry. As the German defences were devastated, more and more RAD men were committed to combat. During the final months of the war RAD men formed 6 major frontline units, which were involved with serious fighting. On the western front RAD troops were used as reinforcements to the 9th SS Engineer Abt (SS-Captain Moeller) in the fighting to retake the northern end of the Arnhem bridge from British Paratroopers under Col. Frost. This action was during [[Operation Market-Garden]] in September 1944. It was noted that the RAD troops had no combat experience. SS-Captain Moeller's report concluded: "These men were rather skeptical and reluctant at the beginning, which was hardly surprising. But when they were put in the right place they helped us a lot; and in time they integrated completely, becoming good and reliable comrades." Losses for these troops were in the hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;Moeller 'Die Schlacht um Arnheim-Oosterbeek. Der Einsatz des Pionier Battalion 9 Hohenstaufen vom 17. bis 26. September 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1549">'''Ringing out''' is a process in [[audio engineering]] used to prevent [[audio feedback]] between on-stage microphones and loudspeakers, and to maximize volume before feedback occurs. Depending on the acoustics of a venue, certain frequencies may be [[Acoustic_resonance|resonant]], and will be more prone to feedback. To ring out a room, a sound technician will raise the gain or fader controls on a mixing desk to induce an audio system to feedback. Once feedback occurs, the technician uses an equalizer, usually a [[graphic equalizer]] to reduce the gain on the appropriate band (or frequency). The frequency of the feedback can be identified using a spectrum analyzer. This is repeated until feedback is sufficiently reduced without compromising the quality of the sound.

Ringing out is particularly important when mixing [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitors]], or foldback. As the performer or musician is usually behind the main PA system, the monitors are so they can hear themselves. As such, a microphone is much more likely to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main PA. Ringing out can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors. Indeed, with larger touring acts, one of the major advantages of the rise in use of [[in-ear monitor]]s is the minimal ringing out that needs to be done.

Hardware exists that can perform many of the same functions that ringing out provides, such as feedback suppression and room optimization.

Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, C.J. (1999). "Assuring the Effectiveness of Silt Fences and Other Sediment Barriers." Proceedings of Conference 30, International Erosion Control Association, Nashville, TN. pp. 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their effectiveness in controlling sediment can be limited, due to problems with poor installation, proper placement, and/or inadequate maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brzozowski |first1=Carol |date=Nov–Dec 2006 |title=Silt Fence Installation |journal=Erosion Control |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |doi= |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/soil/erosion-control-devices/silt-fence-installation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and installation==
Silt fences are often perimeter controls, typically used in combination with [[sediment basin]]s and [[sediment trap (construction)|sediment trap]]s, as well as [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., [[land grading]] and other [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%202.pdf |publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ) |location=Richmond, VA |chapter=Chapter 2. Erosion and Sediment Control Principles, Practices and Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Silt fence installed on a construction site]]
[[File:Silt fence &amp; chain link support.png|thumb|Chain link supported "super" silt fence]]
A typical fence consists of a piece of [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] filter fabric (also called a [[geotextile]]) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched "spoil" from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the silt fence fabric, but the fabric often becomes "blocked off" with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them "filter" storm water for very long).{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be "disturbed" in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence to the top of the structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%203%20-%203.05.pdf |publisher=VA DEQ |section=Spec. 3-05.

[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/siltfences.pdf "Silt Fences."] ''Stormwater Best Management Practice.'' Document no. EPA 833-F-11-008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing for Effective Sediment and Erosion Control for Construction Sites |last=Fifield |first=Jerald S. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Forester Press |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-0-9707687-3-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.6–9}} &lt;ref name="EPA DD"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Guidelines and Standards for the Construction and Development Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines-documents |author=EPA |year=2009 |id=EPA-821-R-09-010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

===Super silt fence===
Some government jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recommend or require the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a "super" silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites.  This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or [[chain link fence]]. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1994 |title=1994 Maryland Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/sedimentstormwater/1994ErosionSed_Section_H.pdf |section=Section H - 26.0: Super Silt Fences |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged.  This typically causes flooding and increased downstream [[water pollution|pollution]]. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which has been shown to be highly susceptible to "washing out" under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Static slicing machine.png|thumb|Static slicing machine]]
===Static slicing installation===
Some [[U.S. state|state]] agencies recommend an installation technique called "static slicing" as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade into the soil with a wedge-type point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical [[soil compaction]], setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.&lt;ref name="EPAsilt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carpenter |first1=Thomas |last2=Sprague |first2=Joel |date=Jul–Aug 2002 |title=Silt Fence Installation Efficacy |journal=Grading and Excavation Contractor |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/construction/silt-fence-installation-efficacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

[http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sw_swppp_guide.pdf “Developing Your Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan: A Guide for Construction Sites.”] Document No. EPA-833-R-060-04.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Silt fence fabrics (geotextiles) tested in laboratory settings have shown to be effective at trapping sediment particles.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{Cite report |title="An Evaluation of the Use and Effectiveness of Temporary Sediment Controls" |url=ftp://ftp.odot.state.or.us/techserv/Geo-Environmental/Environmental/Regulatory%20Documentation%20Forms%20and%20Examples/Water%20Quality/Research%20Technical%20Documents/Barrett%20et%20al%201996.pdf |last1=Barrett |first1=Michael E. |last2=Kearney |first2=John E. |last3=McCoy |first3=Terry G. |last4=Malina |first4=Joseph F., Jr. |last5=Charbeneau |first5=Randall J. |date=March 1996  |publisher=University of Texas at Austin, Center for Transportation Research |id=Research Report 1943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–47}} Although there have been few field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|27–31, 53–55}} (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both [[total suspended solids]] and [[turbidity]].) Other studies and articles about silt fence usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Stevens |first1=Ellen |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=Britton |first3=S.L. |last4=Hayes |first4=J.S. |date=2004 |title=Filter Fence Design Aid for Sediment Control at Construction Sites |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1LT.txt |publisher=EPA |page=22 |id=EPA/600/R-04/185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, static slicing the material into the ground has proven to be the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil on both sides of the fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2000 the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) co-sponsored silt fence efficacy field research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2001 |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report for Installation of Silt Fence Using the Tommy® Static Slicing Method |url=https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/pdf/08_vs_tommy.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Environmental Technology Evaluation Center (EvTEC); Civil Engineering Research Foundation |page= |isbn=0-7844-0565-4}} CERF Report No 40565.&lt;/ref&gt; Silt fence effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given silt fence after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
 
Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down.  A silt fence top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success.&lt;ref name="Fifield" /&gt;{{rp|p.6–10}} The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.&lt;ref name="EPA DD" /&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}
