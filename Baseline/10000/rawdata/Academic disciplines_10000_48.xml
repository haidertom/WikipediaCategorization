The '''Accademia dei Georgofili''' (Academy of Georgofili) was established in [[Florence]] in 1753. The academy has been an historic institution for over 250 years, and is best known for promoting, amongst scholars and landowners, the studying of agronomy, forestry, economy, geography and agriculture.

==History==
The Academy of Georgofili was established in Florence at the beginning of June 1753 as a response to an essay by the Lantern Canon and Abbot Montelatici Ubaldo, who proposed new horizons of agricultural research. It originated from the need to improve agricultural production through rational utilisation of the soil. In 1783 it merged with the Botany Society and received in concession the Giardino dei Semplici (medicinal herb garden). With the Grand Duke [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold of Lorraine]], who granted it his protection, the Academia acquired notable prestige. The academy brought to attention many issues facing agriculture and agricultural economics, including the renewal of agricultural equipment, education, cattle, tenant farming, swampland draining, land reclamation, grain marketing, etc.

The beginning of the Academy was not marked by activities of any special importance, the association rose to true pole of national agricultural progress in the nineteenth century, due to the studies in plow by Lambruschini Raphael and activities and research by Cosimo Ridolfi, one of the leading agronomists of the age of the [[Italian unification]]. Ridolfi proposed the reflection of greater clarity of the agronomic, geographic, economic, and social future of the land of hills that were for centuries the heart of Italian society, being marginalized by the advent of mechanized agriculture on the plains of Europe.

In addition to agronomic studies of Ridolfi, the Academy was fruitfully engaged in the nineteenth century, in the production of wine and an awareness of the poor quality of a great majority of Italian wines, and the need to radically change the technology of the cellar on the forms on the pomological, and thus was born the largest catalog of varieties of fruit on the Peninsula, the Pamona of George Gallesio.

On the night between 26 and 27 May 1993, an explosive device was set off in a Fiat Fiorino packed with explosives near the historic Tower of the Pulci, killing five people and wounding 48 others. The blast caused damage to the library of the academy, resulting in three years of restoration work in order to restore the building to its former state. The incident became known as the [[Via dei Georgofili bombing]].

==Historical archives and library==
The historical archives covering the period of 1753-1911, with a total of over 12,000 manuscripts preserved, and the library is equipped with 70,000 volumes.
[[File:Torre dei pulci, via dei georgofili.JPG|thumb|The [[Torre dei Pulci]], seat of the archive of the academy]]

==Name, Motto, and Emblem==
The term Georgofili comes from the Greek, and literally means "Earth-work-lovers", i.e.: "Devotees of agriculture.". The emblem of the Academy contains the symbols of agricultural activity, dedicated to the Goddess Ceres (I.e. an ear of grain, an olive branch, and a cluster of graphes) as well as those associated with economy activities and commerce dedicated to Mercury (caduceus, intertwined snakes and wings).

The motto of the academy is ''Prosperitati publicae augendae'' (To increase the wealth of the state) and highlights how the activities of the Georgofili are towards public interest.

In [[structural semantics]], the '''actantial model''', also called the '''actantial narrative schema''', is a tool used to analyze the [[Action (fiction)|action]] that takes place in a [[storytelling|story]], whether real or fictional.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Tools'', Ch.5, ''Origins and function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbertActantial"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Actantial''&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in 1966 by [[semiotician]] [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] [1966] ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greimas (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The model considers an action as divided into six facets, called [[actant]]s.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"/&gt; Those actants are a combined framework inspired mainly between [[Vladimir Propp]]'s and [[Étienne Souriau]]'s actantial theories.&lt;ref&gt;Venancio, Rafael Duarte Oliveira, Narrative between Action and Transformation: A. J. Greimas' Narratological Models (December 3, 2016). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2879907&lt;/ref&gt;

Greimas took the term ''actant'' from linguist [[Lucien Tesnière]], which coined in his discussion of the grammar of [[noun phrases]].&lt;ref&gt;David Herman, Manfred Jahn, Marie-Laure Ryan (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Adverse]] Childhood [[Experiences]] (ACEs) Movement''' is a set of [[grassroots]] initiatives developing [[interventions]] and "tests of change" to reduce the incidence and societal effects of [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study|Adverse Childhood Experiences]] and to promote healing from these experiences.

The ACEs Movement arose out of the need for a [[bidirectional effort]] to create a public health change, with both [[individuals]] and institutions/ government systems. The individual is essential, because change is on the individual level is [[self-directed]]. The [[Non-governmental organization|institutions]] and government systems engagement is essential, because without the structure surrounding individuals changing, the very systems that are intended to help, can perpetuate the cycle of trauma.

Dr. Sandra Bloom's book "[[Destroying Sanctuary]]" states in its introduction that 17th century philosophers like [[René Descartes|Descartes]] took apart the person and "turned over the body to physicians and the mind to philosophers and clergy," and in the ACEs movement society is now trying to bring them back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofzdFRgzxpUC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;q=descartes|title=Destroying Sanctuary: The Crisis in Human Service Delivery Systems|last=Bloom|first=Sandra L.|last2=Farragher|first2=Brian|date=2010-10-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199830848|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE Nashville uses the acronym to stand for All Children Excel and is trying to raise awareness about adverse childhood experiences in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Weight of Adverse Childhood Experiences |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/features/article/21018793/the-weight-of-adverse-childhood-experiences |accessdate=31 August 2018 |publisher=Nashville Scene |date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|An illustration of Hero's aeolipile]]
An '''aeolipile''' (or '''aeolipyle''', or '''eolipile'''), also known as a '''Hero's engine''', is a simple bladeless [[radial turbine|radial steam turbine]] which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a [[tip jet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/jet_engine.html jet engine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or rocket engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html NASA Glenn Learning Technologies Project (LTP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Hero of Alexandria]] described the device in [[Roman Egypt]], and many sources give him the credit for its invention.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herons von Alexandria Druckwerke und Automatentheater|author-last=Hero|author-link=Hero of Alexandria|others=Wilhelm Schmidt (translator)|place=Leipzig|publisher=B.G. Teubner|date=1899|language =Greek, German|url=https://archive.org/stream/heronsvonalexandhero#page/228/mode/2up|pages=228–232|chapter=Pneumatika, Book II, Chapter XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aeolipile Hero described is considered to be the first recorded [[steam engine]] or reaction [[steam turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July 2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name – derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word Αἴολος and [[Latin]] word ''pila'' – translates to "the ball of [[Aeolus]]", Aeolus being the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the air and wind.

Pre-dating Heron's writings, a device called an aeolipile was described in the 1st century BC by [[Vitruvius]] in his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''; however, it is unclear if it is the same device or a predecessor, as he does not mention rotating parts.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"/&gt;

==Description and physics==
[[Image:Herosenginesmall.jpg|thumb|A classroom model of an aeolipile]]
The aeolipile consists of a vessel, usually a "simple" [[solid of revolution]], such as a [[sphere]] or a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved [[nozzle]]s projecting from it ([[tipjets]]). When the vessel is pressurized with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the [[rocket engine|rocket]] principle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/aeolipile.html Aeolipile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]]), or [[torque]], causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed ([[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a [[steady state]] speed.

Typically, and as Heron described the device, the water is heated in a simple [[boiler]] which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the [[wiktionary:Pivot|pivot]]s for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model to the right.

==History==
[[File:Aeolipile (from Pneumatica).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from Hero's ''Pneumatica'']]
Both Heron and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by [[Ctesibius]] (285–222 BC), Ctesibius or Ktesibios or Tesibius was an inventor and mathematician in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps.

===Vitruvius's description===
[[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC – c. 15 AD) mentions aeolipiles by name:

"Æolipylæ are hollow brazen vessels, which have an opening or mouth of small size, by means of which they can be filled with water.  Prior to the water being heated over the fire, but little wind is emitted. As soon, however, as the water begins to boil, a violent wind issues forth."&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;''"De Architectura": Chapter VI (paragraph 2)&lt;br /&gt;from "Ten Books on Architecture" by [[Vitruvius]] (1st century BC), published 17, June, 08 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html] accessed 2009-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heron's description===
Heron (c. 10–70 AD) takes a more practical approach, in that he gives instructions how to make one:

{{quote|№ 50. The Steam-Engine.&lt;br /&gt;
PLACE a cauldron over a fire: a ball shall revolve on a pivot. A fire is lighted under a cauldron, A B, (fig. 50), containing water, and covered at the mouth by the lid C D; with this the bent tube E F G communicates, the extremity of the tube being fitted into a hollow ball, H K. Opposite to the extremity G place a pivot, L M, resting on the lid C D; and let the ball contain two bent pipes, communicating with it at the opposite extremities of a diameter, and bent in opposite directions, the bends being at right angles and across the lines F G, L M. As the cauldron gets hot it will be found that the steam, entering the ball through E F G, passes out through the bent tubes towards the lid, and causes the ball to revolve, as in the case of the dancing figures.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;}}

==Practical usage==
[[Image:aeolipile.jpg|thumb|right|A modern replica of Hero's aeolipile]]
It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times, and if it was seen as a pragmatic device, a whimsical novelty, an object of reverence, or some other thing. A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry|last=Gruntman|first=Mike|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=156347705X|location=Reston, VA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hero's drawing shows a standalone device, and was presumably intended as a "temple wonder," like many of the other devices described in ''[[Pneumatica]]''{{what|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref name = "HeroSteamEngine"&gt;{{citation | title = Pneumatica | chapter = Section 50 – The Steam Engine | author = Hero | place = Alexandria | date = 1851 | origyear = reprint of 1st century CE original | publisher = Taylor Walton and Maberly | publication-place = London | chapter-url =http://himedo.net/TheHopkinThomasProject/TimeLine/Wales/Steam/URochesterCollection/Hero/section50.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}   Translated from the original Greek by Bennet Woodcroft '' (Professor of Machinery in [[University College London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius, on the other hand, mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather. He describes the aeolipile as

{{Usul al-fiqh}}

'''''Ahkam''''' ({{transl|ar|aḥkām}}, {{lang-ar|أحكام}} "provisions", plural of '''{{transl|ar|ḥukm}}''' ({{lang|ar|حُكْم}})) is an Islamic term with several meanings. In the Quran, the word ''hukm'' is variously used to mean arbitration, judgement, authority, or [[God in Islam|God]]'s will.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hukm|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e890}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Islamic period, the [[Kharijite]]s gave it political connotations by declaring that they accept only the ''hukm'' of God ({{lang|ar|حُكْمُ اللّهِ}}).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The word acquired new meanings in the course of Islamic history, being used to refer to worldly executive power or to a court decision.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; In the plural, ''ahkam'', it commonly refers to specific Quranic rules, or to the legal rulings derived using the methodology of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as "the five decisions" (''al-aḥkām al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''farḍ'' or ''wājib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mandūb'' or ''mustaḥabb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mubāḥ''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makrūh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''ḥarām'').&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; According to scholar of Islam Joseph Schacht, the categories were developed at least two centuries after Muhammad's time.{{#tag:ref|"The five categories` as such are as yet unknown to Shafi'i and his predecessors." Al-Shafi'i died in 204 AH (820 AD).&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-133&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

== Five ruling types ==

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as “the five decisions” ({{lang|ar|الأحكام الخمسة}}, {{transl|ar|al-aḥkām al-khamsa}}):&lt;ref name=vikor&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first=Knut S.|last=Vikør|title=Sharīʿah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Emad El-Din Shahin|year=2014|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# {{transl|ar|[[farḍ]]/wājib}} ({{lang|ar|واجب / فرض}}) - compulsory, obligatory
# {{transl|ar|[[mustaḥabb]]/mandūb}} ({{lang|ar|مستحب}}) - recommended
# {{transl|ar|[[mubāḥ]]}} ({{lang|ar|مباح}}) - neutral, not involving God's judgment
# {{transl|ar|[[makrūh]]}} ({{lang|ar|مكروه}}) - disliked, reprehensible
# {{transl|ar|[[ḥarām]]/maḥzūr}} ({{lang|ar|محظور / حرام}}) - forbidden

It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;&lt;ref name=hallaq20&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|first=Wael B.|last=Hallaq|authorlink = Wael Hallaq|title=An Introduction to Islamic Law |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;&lt;ref name=hallaq20/&gt; Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[ḥalāl]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt; The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''ḍarūra'').&lt;ref name=vikor/&gt;

== General considerations ==
{{Original research section|Includes some highly dubious statements sourced to an inaccessible book|date=May 2017}}

The ḥukm shar‘ī (aḥkām) in its literal sense carries the meaning of a rule of Islamic law. Thus aḥkām (rules) is the plural form of ḥukm (rule), which means rule, command, the absolute, order, judgment, injunction, prescription, and decree.  This rule could be a rule of any kind; it is to command one to delegate an order to another whether approval or disapproval. You could say that the moon is rising or the moon is not rising,  or that fire burns.&lt;ref name=kayadibi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kayadibi|first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh)|date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|location=Kuala Lumpur|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, it is considered a rule of Islamic law. Āmidī (d. 631/1234)  defines adillah as the science of the proofs of fiqh and the indications that they provide with regard to the aḥkām of the sharī‘ah.&lt;ref name=kayadibi/&gt; The ḥukm shar‘ī consists of four fundamental elements. These elements are: the Ḥākim (Lawgiver), the maḥkūm alayh (the subject), the maḥkūm fīh (the act of the mukallaf), and the ḥukm (ruling).&lt;ref name=kayadibi/&gt;

==Emergency conditions==
Religious precepts may be relaxed under certain extraordinary conditions.  For example, although Muslims are required to fast during [[Ramadan]], it is not only acceptable but recommended for an ill man to break his fast if fasting will worsen his illness.

==Fatwa==
It is similar to but differs from a [[fatwa]].&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|471}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6629">The '''American Musicological Society''' is a membership-based [[musicology|musicological]] organization founded in 1934 to advance scholarly research in the various fields of music as a branch of learning and scholarship. It grew out of a small contingent of the [[Music Teachers National Association]] and, more directly, the New York Musicological Society (1930–1934). Its founders were George S. Dickinson, [[Carl Engel]], [[Gustave Reese]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], [[Joseph Schillinger]], [[Charles Seeger]], [[Harold Spivacke]], [[Oliver Strunk]], and [[Joseph Yasser]]. Its first president was [[Otto Kinkeldey]], the first American to receive an appointment as professor of musicology ([[Cornell University]], 1930).

== Overview ==
The society consists of individual members divided among fifteen regional chapters across the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, as well as subscribing institutions. It was admitted to the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] in 1951, and participates in the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]] and the [[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale]].

The society's annual meetings consist of presentations, [[symposium|symposia]], and concerts, as well as more-or-less informal meetings of numerous related musical societies. Many of the society's awards, prizes and fellowships are announced at these meetings.

== Publications ==
Most of the society's resources are dedicated to musicological publications: the triannual ''[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]]'' (1948-present) published by the [[University of California Press]]. The journal was preceded by the annual ''Bulletin'' (1936–1947) and the annual ''Papers'' (1936–1941). Online versions of these publications are available at [[JSTOR]] and the University of California Press.

Other studies and documents published by the society include the complete works of [[William Billings]], edited by [[Karl Kroeger]] et al. (4 vols, 1977–1990), the series ''Music of the United States of America'' (1993–present),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/%7Emusausa/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Ockeghem]]'s collected works edited by [[Dragan Plamenac]] and Richard Wexler (3 vols., 1966, 1992), [[John Dunstaple]]'s complete works edited by [[Manfred Bukofzer]], published jointly with [[Musica Britannica]] (1970), [[Joseph Kerman]]'s ''The Elizabethan Madrigal'' (1962),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Kerman.php&lt;/ref&gt; E. R. Reilly's ''Quantz and his Versuch'' (1971), E. H. Sparks's ''The Music of Noel Bauldeweyn'' (1972), ''Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to [[Alvin H. Johnson]]'' edited by [[Lewis Lockwood]] and Edward Roesner (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams-net.org/pubs/Johnson.php |title=Essays in Musicology: a Tribute to Alvin H. Johnson |website=American Musicological Society |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in conjunction with the [[International Musicological Society]], ''Doctoral Dissertations in Musicology'' edited by C. D. Adkins and A. Dickinson in succession to [[Helen Hewitt]] (1952, 1957, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1977, 1984 [first cumulative edition], 1990, 1996 [second series, second cumulative edition]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams-net.org/ddm/&lt;/ref&gt;(Brunswick, 2011)

'''''Atheism in Christianity''''' ({{lang-de|Atheismus im Christentum}}) is a 1968 book by Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nh/&gt; The book offers a third way to the Christian/atheist either/or debate. Gareth Jenkins from Socialist Review says that Bloch "argues that there are liberatory, 'atheist' elements within Christianity with which socialists should make common cause."&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

The '''Billion Tree Tsunami''' was launched in 2014, by the government of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (KPK), Pakistan, as a response to the challenge of [[global warming]].

==Inspiration==
The Billion Tree Tsunami Project is driven by the [[Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]’s vision of green growth which ties in the needs for sustainable forestry development, generating green jobs, gender empowerment, preserving Pakistan’s [[natural capital]] while also addressing the global issue of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project – Country's largest plantation drive|url=http://103.240.220.71/btt/|publisher=Forestry, Environment &amp; Wildlife Department, KP|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afforestation Regions==
The Billion Tree Tsunami covers the whole province of KPK.

{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Budapest School''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti iskola}}; {{lang-de|Budapester Schule}}) was a [[school of thought]], originally of [[Marxist humanism]], but later of [[Post-Marxism]] and dissident [[Liberalism]] that emerged in [[Hungary]] in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of [[Georg Lukács]]. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on [[social ontology]] and [[aesthetics]], but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory.  Most of the members later came to abandon [[Marxism]]. The School also critiqued the "dictatorship over needs" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.

In a letter to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from [[Western Marxism]].

Members of the school include [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Ferenc Fehér]] [[:hu:Fehér Ferenc (filozófus)|(hu)]], [[György Márkus]], [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and [[Maria Márkus]], among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.

==History==
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of [[actually existing socialism]] and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar [[Simon Tormey]] as "a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'."

Heller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "everyday life". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

The Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from [[Neoclassical Economics]], as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the [[mixed economies]] of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Nordic Model]] was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.

==Ágnes Heller==

Heller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.

==Work==
Duncan's work examines the critical role that museums play in defining cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Khan Academy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farber|first1=Dr. Allen|title=How museums shape meaning|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-basics/tools-understanding-art/a/tissot-london-visitors|website=Khan Academy|publisher=Khan Academy|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Duncan and fellow feminist art historians, [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Lise Vogel]], first questioned formerly hallowed principals such as the idea of quality in art, the cannon of great artists and art and artistic genius.&lt;ref name="The expanding discourse"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Broude ed.|first1=Norma|last2=Garrard ed.|first2=Mary D.|title=The expanding discourse : feminism and art history|date=1992|publisher=IconEditions|location=New York|isbn=0064303918|pages=2, 12, 127, 305, 363, 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1975 essay titled "When Greatness is a Box of Wheaties" is considered a key text of [[Feminist history|feminist art history]], articulating the feminist critique of genius in art.&lt;ref name="n.paradoxa’s 12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deepwell|first1=Katy|title=n.paradoxa’s 12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=n.paradoxa|date=September 2010|issue=12|pages=6, 8|url=https://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She can only view a version of woman that is defined by the male creator, but is denied the role of creator and thus denied entry to "the central arena of high culture".&lt;ref name="Performing the Body/Performing the Text"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Amelia ed.|last2=Stephenson|first2=Andres ed.|title=Performing the Body/Performing the Text|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Google Books|isbn=1134655932|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkLnd-jP99gC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=carol+duncan+The+MoMA's+hot+mamas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP2pbd753XAhUW92MKHTzfAO8Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20duncan%20The%20MoMA's%20hot%20mamas&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic art''' is associated with the peoples known as [[Celts]]; those who spoke the [[Celtic languages]] in [[Europe]] from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the [[Bronze Age]], and indeed the preceding [[Neolithic age]]; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the [[European Iron Age]] from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the [[La Tène]] period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation &amp; that their article will only cover the La Tène period.&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Early Celtic art''' is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |title=Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804214909/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/project_archive/technologies_of_enchantment.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |publisher=[[British Museum]]}} It is also used by Jacobsthal; however the equivalent "Late Celtic art" for Early Medieval work is much rarer, and "Late Celtic art" can also mean the later part of the prehistoric period.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Early Medieval]] art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the [[Book of Kells]] and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called [[Insular art]] in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Energetic circular forms, [[triskele]]s and spirals are characteristic.  Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from [[Pictish stones]] and the Insular [[high crosses]], large [[monumental sculpture]], even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly the few standing male figures found, like the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] and the so-called [[Glauberg#The Keltenf.C3.BCrst .28Celtic Prince.29 of Glauberg .E2.80.93 Germany.27s oldest monumental sculpture.3F|"Lord of Glauberg"]], were originally common in wood.

Also covered by the term is the visual art of the [[Celtic Revival]] (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by [[Modern Celts]], mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and [[nationalism]], and became popular well beyond the [[Celtic nations]], and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from [[Celtic cross]] [[funerary art|funerary monuments]] to interlace [[tattoo]]s.  Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age.  Another influence was that of late La Tène "vegetal" art on the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.

Typically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: "Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover  precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ancient peoples now called "Celts" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier [[Hallstatt culture]] and [[La Tène culture]]. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Brian "Saxons, Vikings, and Celts" (2008) W.W. Norton &amp; Co. NY, pp.&amp;nbsp;281–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which "Celtic" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial.

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.

The term "Celt" was used in classical times as a synonym for the [[Gauls]] (Κελτοι, ''Celtae''). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as [[Edward Lhuyd]] brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]—and [[Goidelic]]—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.
Then in the 18th century the interest in "[[primitivism]]", which led to the idea of the "[[noble savage]]", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and [[Druid]]ic. The "Irish revival" came after the ''[[Catholic Emancipation]] Act of 1829'' as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the "[[Celtic Revival]]".

==Pre-Celtic periods==
The earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture, comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC.  Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on "Celticization" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions.  [[Megalithic art]] across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many [[rock drawings]] left by the [[Neolithic]] [[Brú na Bóinne|Boyne Valley culture]] in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later.  Other centres such as [[Brittany]] are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today.  Other correspondences are between the [[gold lunula]]s and large collars of [[Bronze Age]] Ireland and Europe and the [[torc]]s of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck.  The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.

==Iron Age; Early Celtic art==
[[File:Stone sculpture of celtic hero.jpg|thumb|[[Mšecké Žehrovice Head|Stone head from Mšecké Žehrovice]], Czech Republic, wearing a [[torc]], late La Tène culture]]
Unlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern "Celtic nations", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for "town", [[oppidum]], is now used.  The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves.  The work of the German émigré to Oxford, [[Paul Jacobsthal]], remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his ''Early Celtic Art'' of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Raftery, 184-185; for a preview or summary, see Jacobsthal (1935), and for a long summary in a review see Hawkes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles.  Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as "Celtic".

As Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek [[krater]] from the [[Vix Grave]] in [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which was made in [[Magna Graecia]] (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited.  It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 Le Musée du Pays Châtillonnais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230222/http://www.musee-vix.fr/fr/index.php?page=38 |date=2016-03-03 }} Vix Krater (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another huge Greek vessel in the [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave]] is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman&lt;/ref&gt;  Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roquepertuse-Guerriers.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture from [[Roquepertuse]], including "skull-niches" and seated figures]]

Figures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are "cult wagons" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect.  There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a "leaf crown" — two flattish rounded projections, "resembling a pair of bloated commas", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"&gt;Raftery, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Human heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based.  Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions.  In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large.  There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 121-126, 138-142&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including [[relief]]s, come from southern France, at [[Roquepertuse]] and [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]], close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed.  These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.

In general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people.  There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx British Museum highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221406/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/l/la_t%C3%A8ne.aspx |date=2015-09-23 }}, La Tène&lt;/ref&gt;), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the [[Waterloo Helmet]], often have no similar other finds for comparison.  Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.

==La Tène style==
[[File:Gold torque 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Torc]] from the [[Vix Grave]], 480 BC]]
About 500 BC the [[La Tène]] style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction.  The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-5102_1996_num_108_2_1954|title=Manufatti in ferro di tipo La Tène in area italiana : le potenzialità non sfruttate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modern Hungary.  In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all.  Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including [[Scythian art]] and that of the Greeks and [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]] among others. The occupation by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 226-233; Laings, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;  La Tène style is "a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes".&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display.  Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Chapters 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich "princely" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from [[inhumation]] burials to [[cremation]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 21-26; 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[torc]] was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner.  Bracelets and armlets were also common.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 72-79&lt;/ref&gt;  An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant.  The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, [[Chamalières]], France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at [[Clermont-Ferrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Megaws; in the [[Musée Bargoin]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Couvercle bronze gaulois - La Fosse Cotheret (Val d'Oise).jpg|thumb|left|Bronze fitting from France in the "vegetal" style]]

Several phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain.  In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the "early" or "strict" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the "vegetal", "Continuous Vegetal", "[[Waldalgesheim style]]", or De Navarro II, where ornament is "typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface".&lt;ref name="Raftery, 186"/&gt;

After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into "plastic" and "sword" styles, the latter mainly found on [[scabbard]]s and the former featuring decoration in high [[relief]].  One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a "[[Disney]] style" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an "Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC".  De Navarro distinguishes the "insular" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V,&lt;ref&gt;Megaws (Oppida period); Megaw and Megaw, 10-11, with more detail on these schemes; Laings, 41-42, 94-95; also see Harding, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 233 and Chapter 9; Laings, 94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Britishmuseumsnettishamgreattorc.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Torc from Snettisham]], England, 1st century BC.]]

The often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other "foreign" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.  So a torc in the rich [[Vix Grave]] terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the [[Snettisham Hoard]] that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up.  The 1st century BC [[Gundestrup cauldron]], is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69&amp;nbsp;cm, height 42&amp;nbsp;cm), but though much of its [[iconography]] seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of [[Thracian]] manufacture.  To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Agris Helmet]] in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.

By the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.

A form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celticmirrors.org/ Celtic mirrors website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126064442/http://celticmirrors.org/ |date=2010-01-26 }}, with good pictures and information.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Staffordshire Moorlands Pan (1284837406).jpg|thumb|The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]], 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel.]]

Despite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality.  Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard [[chape]]s, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern [[Northern Ireland]], notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion.  It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 127-133&lt;/ref&gt;

But in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations.  Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south.&lt;ref&gt;Garrow, 2, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover google books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231906/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lZj9AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a [[Irish Dark Age|period of instability]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially [[Ancient Roman pottery]], of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including [[figurine]]s of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles.  [[Roman Britain]] produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the [[fibula]] but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult,&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 125-130&lt;/ref&gt; for example a "hinged brass collar" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx Hinged brass collar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170209/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/hinged_brass_collar.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}, British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain also made more use of  [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of [[champlevé]] technique was probably important to the later [[Medieval art]] of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element.  Enamel decoration on [[penannular brooch]]es, "dragonesque" brooches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/d/dragonesque_brooch.aspx|title=Dragonesque brooch |publisher=[[British Museum]]|author=|date=|website=britishmuseum.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hanging bowl]]s appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.

===Post-Roman Ireland and Britain===
Celtic art in the [[Middle Ages]] was practiced by the peoples of [[Ireland]] and parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 700-year period from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of [[Romanesque art]] in the 12th century.  Through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.

In Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period.  The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late [[Iron Age]] La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134, 172-173&lt;/ref&gt;  With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish  contacts with the [[Anglo-Saxons]], creating what is called the Insular or [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before [[Viking]] raids severely disrupted monastic life.  Late in the period [[Scandinavia]]n influences were added through the [[Vikings]] and mixed [[Norse-Gael]] populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the [[Normans|Norman]] invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.

The [[interlace (art)|interlace]] patterns that are often regarded as typical of "Celtic art" were in fact introduced to Insular art from the Mediterranean, both directly and via the [[Animal style#Germanic animal style|animal Style II]] of Germanic [[Migration Period art]], though they were taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: [[Gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]] and [[Book of Lindisfarne]], chalices like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], and [[penannular brooch]]es like the [[Tara Brooch]].  These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the [[Viking]] attacks sharply set back cultural life.
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ardagh Chalice]], silver and [[millefiori]] glass. Irish. Early 8th century AD.]]

In the 7th and 9th centuries [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish Celtic missionaries]] travelled to [[Northumbria]] in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]], which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon [[metalworking]] knowledge and [[motif (art)|motifs]]. In the [[monastery|monasteries]] of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the [[Anglo-Saxon]] art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the [[Tara Brooch]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]]. New techniques employed were [[filigree]] and [[chip carving]], while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The [[Book of Durrow]] is the earliest complete [[insular script]] illuminated [[Gospel Book]] and by about 700,  with the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed [[carpet page]]s that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the [[Book of Kells]], the most elaborate Insular manuscript.  Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] for the rest of the [[Middle Ages]].

In the 9th and 11th century plain [[silver]] became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver [[penannular brooch]]es were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. [[Sculpture]] began to flourish in the form of the "[[high cross]]", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at [[Monasterboice]] and the [[Ahenny]] High Cross.
[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christ in Majesty]], [[Book of Kells]].]]

The impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Ringerike style|Ringerike]] and [[Urnes style]]s, for example the [[Cross of Cong]] and [[Shrine of Manchan]]. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of [[Dublin]], but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at [[Kilfenora]] and crosses at the [[Rock of Cashel]].

Some Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century [[Lichfield Gospels]] and [[Hereford Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lord, Medieval Vision: The Visual Culture of Wales. University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2003, pg. 25; see the Wikipedia articles on the two manuscripts for further references.&lt;/ref&gt;  The late Insular [[Ricemarch Psalter]] from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence.


Art from historic [[Dumnonia]], modern Cornwall, [[Devon]], [[Somerset]] and [[Brittany]] on the [[Atlantic]] seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period.&lt;ref&gt;http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol33/33_001_006.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151203105658/http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1%2Fdissemination%2Fpdf%2Fvol33%2F33_001_006.pdf |date=2015-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However archaeological studies at sites such as [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset]],&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, L. 1995 ''Cadbury Castle: The Early Medieval Archaeology'', University of Wales; see also the [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Bibliography.html South Cadbury Environs Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131115350/http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/scep/Bibliography.html |date=2016-01-31 }}, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tintagel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/archaeology/Research/Pages/TintagelRegionArchaeologicalLandscapeProject.aspx  Tintagel Region Archaeological Landscape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124090504/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/archaeology/Research/Pages/TintagelRegionArchaeologicalLandscapeProject.aspx |date=2015-11-24 }}, University of Winchester&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently at [[Ipplepen]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/ipplepen/context/ The Ipplepen project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223025534/https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/ipplepen/context/ |date=2016-02-23 }}, University of Exeter&lt;/ref&gt; indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the [[Byzantine]] Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the '[[Hen Ogledd|Old North]]'.

===Picts (Scotland)===
From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the [[Picts]] is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts.  The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including [[Iona]], and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south.  After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced [[Pictish art]], with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.

The heavy silver [[Whitecleuch Chain]] has [[Pictish symbols]] on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the [[Norrie's Law hoard]]. These are thought to be relatively early pieces.  The [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]] of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of [[Pictland]] and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD.   

[[Pictish stones]] are assigned by scholars to 3 classes.  Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the [[Pictish Beast]], and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror).  The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others.  This is often taken to symbolise a woman.  Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east [[Scotland]] from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Shetland]].  Good examples include the [[Dunnichen Stone|Dunnichen]] and [[Aberlemno]] stones ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones ([[Aberdeenshire]]).
[[File:Pictish Stones in the Museum of ScotlandDSCF6250 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pictish symbols and a rider on a [[Pictish stone]]]]

Class II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces.  The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the [[Insular art|Insular style]].  On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes.  Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so.  The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures.  Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology.  Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[Aberlemno]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Nigg, Highland|Nigg]], [[Shandwick]] and [[Hilton of Cadboll]] ([[Easter Ross]]).

Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols.  Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, [[Perthshire]]).  These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century.  Examples include the [[sarcophagus]] and the large collection of cross-slabs at [[St Andrews]] ([[Fife]]).

The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle ([[Perthshire]]), [[St Vigeans]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]) and [[St Andrew's Cathedral, St Andrews|St Andrew's Cathedral]] ([[Fife]]) (all [[Historic Scotland]]), the [[Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]] (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, [[Forfar]] ([[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]), [[Inverness Museum]], [[Groam House Museum]], [[Rosemarkie]] and Tarbat Discovery Centre, [[Portmahomack]] (both [[Easter Ross]]) and Tankerness House Museum, [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]].

==Celtic revival==
[[File:Boyscuchulaincover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Boys' [[Cuchulain]]'', 1904, in fact closer to Viking [[Urnes style]].]]
{{main article|Celtic Revival}}
The revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in [[Celtic literature]].  By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries.  Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades.  The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as [[Louis Sullivan]], and in [[stained glass]] and wall stenciling by [[Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy]], both based in [[Chicago]] with its large [[Irish-American]] population.  The "plastic style" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into [[Art Nouveau]] decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the [[Isle of Man|Man]]xman [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who did much work for [[Liberty &amp; Co.]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, [[Thomas Bodkin]], writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, "National art all over the world has burst long ago, the  
narrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation." George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. "Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walker, The Modern History of Celtic Jewellery, Walker Metalsmiths, Andover, NY 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlace, which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] setting. ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is an [[animation|animated]] feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.

By the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carroll, post 1170 in Discussion of Celtic Art, Yahoo Groups 2001, accessed Aug. 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries. &lt;ref&gt;Walker, pg 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

June 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021004000/https://celticlife.com/international-celtic-art-day/ |archivedate=2017-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic art types and terms==
[[File:Hanging bowl DSCF6984.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[hanging bowl]] from [[Sutton Hoo]]]]
&lt;!--Note: this is a list of classes or types or terms, not specific pieces--&gt;
*[[Hanging bowl]]. According to the traditional theory, these were created by Celtic craftsmen during the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquests of England. They were based on a Roman design, usually made of copper alloy with 3 or 4 suspension loops along the top rim, from which they were designed to be hung, perhaps from roof-beams or within a tripod. Their art-historical interest mainly derives from the round decorated plaques, often with enamel, that most have along their rims.  Some of the finest examples are found in the hoard at [[Sutton Hoo]] (625) which are enamelled. The knowledge of their manufacture spread to Scotland and Ireland in the 8th century. However, although their styles continue popular Romano-British traditions, the assumption that they were made in Ireland is now questioned.
*[[Carpet page]]. An illuminated manuscript page decorated entirely in ornamentation. In Hiberno-Saxon tradition this was a standard feature of Gospel books, with one page as an introduction to each Gospel. Usually made in a geometric or interlace pattern, often framing a central cross. The earliest known example is the 7th century [[Bobbio Orosius]].
*[[High cross]]. A tall stone standing cross, usually of [[Celtic cross]] form.  Decoration is abstract often with figures in carved relief, especially [[crucifixion]]s, but in some cases complex multi-scene schemes.  Most common in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and near continental mission centres.
*[[Pictish stone]]. A cross-slab&amp;mdash;a rectangular slab of rock with a cross carved in relief on the slab face, with other pictures and shapes carved throughout. Organised into three Classes, based on the period of origin.
*[[Insular art]] or the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, from the 6th to 9th centuries. The fusion of pre-Christian Celtic and Anglo-Saxon metalworking styles, applied to the new form of the religious illuminated manuscript, as well as sculpture and secular and church metalwork.  Also includes influences from post-classical Europe, and later Viking decorative styles.  The peak of the style in manuscripts occurred when Irish Celtic missionaries traveled to Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Produced some of the most outstanding Celtic art of the Middle Ages in illuminated manuscripts, metalworking and sculpture.
*[[Celtic calendar]]. The oldest material Celtic calendar is the fragmented [[Gaulish]] [[Coligny calendar]] from the 1st century BC or AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5479">'''Chartered Physicist''' ('''CPhys''') is a [[chartered (professional)|chartered status]] and a [[professional qualification]] awarded by the [[Institute of Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/physicist.aspx|title=Job profiles: Physicist|website=National Careers Service|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by the postnominals "CPhys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkqCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|page=xvii|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving chartered status in any profession denotes to the wider community a high level of specialised subject knowledge and professional competence. According to the Institute of Physics, holders of the award of the Chartered Physicist (CPhys) demonstrate the "highest standards of professionalism, up-to-date expertise, quality and safety" along with "the capacity to undertake independent practice and exercise leadership" as well as "commitment to keep pace with advancing knowledge and with the increasing expectations and requirements for which any profession must take responsibility".&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/cphys/page_51812.html|title=Chartered Physicist (CPhys)|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Chartered Physicist was introduced in 1985 following approval from the [[Privy Council (UK)|Privy Council]]. It was originally granted  automatically with corporate membership of the Institute of Physics (IoP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtMiBPgdF6cC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=125 Years: The Physical Society &amp; The Institute of Physics|author=John L. Lewis|publisher=CRC Press|date= 1 January 1999|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of the membership structure in 1998 saw Chartered Physicist established as a separate qualification from 2001 that could be gained either alongside or after the status of Member or Fellow of the IoP. In order to gain the qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or [[MPhys]] integrated master's degree is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For physicists gaining the status from 2012, revalidation through proof of [[continuing professional development]] is required every three years.&lt;ref name="CPhys guidelines"/&gt; 

Chartered Physicist is considered to be equal in status to [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], which the IoP also awards as a member of the [[Engineering Council UK]], and other chartered statuses in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/membership/char-sta/chartership/why/file_38066.pdf|title=Becoming Chartered by the Institute – Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=25 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|quote="[Q]Which one [Chartered Physicist or Chartered Engineer] is best?

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

'''Commercial character design''' is the process of creating a character and utilising it to enhance or publicise a commercial entity through design. 

== Design process ==
Examples of characters which have been designed to be used in a commercial application are found throughout the modern world, on advertisement billboards, murals, graphic marketing within interior spaces and within recent years, as animations on the Internet. A character can appear in two dimension (2D) or as a three-dimensional design (3D) as modelled using a computer or traditionally sculpted. Commercial entities use characters which are designed to embody a [[brand image]] or enhance a sales campaign.

== Well-known designers ==
Well known design companies include:
*[[Walt Disney Company]] (animators and cartoonists)
*[[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] (advertisers)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42141">'''Communication privacy management''' ('''CPM'''), originally known as '''communication boundary management''', is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by [[Sandra Petronio]] in 1991.

Petronio uses a boundary [[metaphor]] to explain the privacy management process. '''[[#Private boundaries|Privacy boundaries]]''' draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a [[#Rule-based management system|rule-based management system]] to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her
[[self-disclosure]]s. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A
distressing sense of "[[#Boundary turbulence|boundary turbulence]]" can arise when
clashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:

(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.

== Background ==
Petronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical
conception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Communication Privacy Management in Electronic Commerce|last = |first = |date = 2001|journal = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Altman and Taylor's [[social penetration theory]] focused on [[self-disclosure]] as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called ''communication boundary management''. In 2002, she renamed it to ''communication privacy management'', underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.

==Assumptions==
* Humans are choice-makers
* Humans are rule-makers and rule-followers
* Humans' choices and rules are based on a consideration of others as well as the self
* Relational life is characterized by change
* Contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844725577|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory elements==

=== Private information ===
[[File:CPM Basic Suppositions.png|thumb|230x230px]]
The content of concealing and revealing is private information. Petronio favored the term "private information" over the term "self-disclosure" because there are many [[caveat lector|caveats]] inherent to private information disclosure that are not present with self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"&gt;Petronio, S. (2002). Boundaries of Privacy: Dialectics of Disclosure. Albany, NY: SUNY Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the motivations behind sharing are many, including but not limited to: sharing a burden, righting a wrong, and influencing others.&lt;ref name="Petronio 19912"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S | year = 1991 | title = Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples | url = | journal = Communication Theory | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 311–335 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.1991.tb00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since private information can be about yourself or others, the decision as to what is private and whom to share it with plays a part when taking the idea of boundaries into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Alicia|last2=Derlega|first2=Valerien|last3=Morrow|first3=Jennifer|title=What is Highly Personal Information and How Is It Related to Self-Disclosure Decision-Making?|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=Aug 20, 2006|volume=23|issue=2|pages=85–92|doi=10.1080/08824090600668915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to share is ultimately left up to the process of the privacy rule management system which combines rules for coordination of information, characteristics of disclosure, and attributes of the nature of boundaries.

=== Private boundaries ===
To understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the [[Personal boundaries|boundary]]. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982"&gt;Petronio, S., Ellmers, N., Giles, H., Gallois, C. (1998). (Mis)communicating across boundaries: Interpersonal and intergroup considerations. Communication Research, 25, 571–595.
&lt;/ref&gt; When private information is shared, there will be a '''collective boundary'''. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a '''personal boundary'''. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).
[[File:Personal and Collective Boundaries.jpg.png|thumb|Personal and collective boundaries]]

=== Control and ownership ===
Communication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. [[Concurrent estate|Co-ownership]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Durham, W.T. (2008). Communication privacy management theory. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 309-322). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule-based management system===
[[File:Three processes.jpg.png|thumb|right]]

As the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

=== Management dialectics ===
[[File:Boundaries in a Life Span.png|thumb|224x224px]]
Petronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Rierson 2009"&gt;Petronio, S., &amp; Reierson, J. (2009). Regulating the Privacy of Confidentiality: Grasping the Complexities through Communication Privacy Management Theory. Uncertainty, Information Management, and Disclosure Decisions: Theories and Applications. 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of [[dialectic]] that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of [[relational dialectics]], wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship, but that at any given moment decisions are weighed using multiple viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Baxter, Montgomery 1996"&gt;Baxter, L.A., &amp; Montgomery, B. (1996). Relating Dialogues and dialectics: New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule-based management system ==
Petronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.

===Privacy rule characteristics===
The characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991"&gt;Petronio, S. (1991). Communication boundary management: A theoretical model of managing disclosure of private information between married couples. [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]], 1, 311–335.&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"&gt;Petronio, S. (2007). Translational Research Endeavors and the Practices of Communication Privacy Management. Journal of Applied Communication Research, 35, 218-222.
&lt;/ref&gt; Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:

|If we're in a traumatic situation (e.g., we've survived an earthquake together), we'll develop new rules
|-
|''Motivation ''
|catalyst
|Owners of information can form certain bonds that lead to disclosure, or conversely the express interest in forming bonds may cause private information to be shared. Motivations for sharing can include reciprocity or self-clarification.
|If you have disclosed a great deal to me, out of reciprocity, I might be motivated to disclose to you

|Owners of private information evaluate risks relative to the benefits of disclosure or maintaining information private. 
|Our rules are influenced by our assessment of the ratio of risks to benefits of disclosing

With these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.

===Boundary coordination===
An individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information.&lt;ref name="Petronio 20072"/&gt; By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development.  
*'''''Boundary permeability''''' refers to the nature of the invisible divisions that keep private information from being known outside of an individual or particular group. When private information is kept with one owner, the boundaries are said to be thick because there is less possibility for information to make its way out into the public sphere. Once information is shared to one or more persons, the boundaries for that private information expand, become more permeable, and are considered ''thin''.&lt;ref name="Petronio, Durham 20082"/&gt;
*'''''Boundary linkage''''' has to do with how owners are connected when they build associations through a boundary. For example, doctors and patients are linked to each other in such a way that private information is passed within their boundaries constantly. These linkages can be strong or weak depending on how information was shared or whether a co-owner wanted to know or was prepared to learn a new piece of information. Case in point, the link between an organization and a spy meant to infiltrate the organization is weak because the two are not coordinated on how information will be maintained private or disclosed.&lt;ref name="Caughlin, Afifi 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caughlin | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Afifi | first2 = T.D. | year = 2004 | title = When is topic avoidance unsatisfying? Examining moderators of the association between avoidance and dissatisfaction | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 479–513 | doi=10.1093/hcr/30.4.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Boundary ownership''''' refers to the responsibilities and rights each person has over the control of the spread of information that they [[Ownership|own]]. When working to mutually create the boundary of privacy it is key for all parties to have a clear understanding of whether information should be shared, who it should be shared with, and when it should be shared.&lt;ref name="Petronio 1991" /&gt; A simple example of this is the planning of a surprise birthday party; all those involved in planning must agree on how the information about the party will be spread so as not to ruin the surprise. As new guests are invited, they become an owner of the information and are bound to the rules of privacy maintenance, or else the surprise could be ruined.

===Boundary turbulence===
Often, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners – this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. [[Clear-air turbulence|Turbulence]] among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had,&lt;ref name="Petronio 20022"/&gt; which can happen for a number of reasons.

Boundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.

In addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Afifi | first1 = T. D. | year = 2003 | title = Feeling caught" in stepfamilies: managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 729–755 | doi=10.1177/0265407503206002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.

Lastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of [[social media]] and, in particular, [[Facebook]], boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and [[Friending|"friend"]] their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanter |first1=M. |last2=Robbins |first2=S. |title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent-Child Relationship Quality |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2012 |page=900 of 917 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x |volume=62|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries.&lt;ref name="Petronio, et al. 19982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt; It should be noted, however, that turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLaren|first1=R.M.|title=Emotions, Communicative responses, and relational consequences of boundary turbulence|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=August 2013|volume=30|issue=5|pages=606–626|doi=10.1177/0265407512463997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory applications ==
Communication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid = |volume=13 |pages=6–14|last1 = Petronio|first1 = Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) work environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Seumas | last2 = Weckert | first2 = John | year = 2000 | title = Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet | url = | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 255–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family communication===

Specific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management. Research focused on secrets and topic avoidance, such as questions of concealment to [[Stepfamily|stepfamily members]] feeling caught, and parents-adolescent conversations about sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Feeling caught' in stepfamilies: Managing boundary turbulence through appropriate communication privacy rules|last = Afifi|first = T.D.|date = 2003|journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/0265407503206002|pmid =|volume=20|issue = 6|pages=729–755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family privacy research over the decades are also inspired specifically by the chapter of parental privacy invasion. For example, work by Hawk and his colleagues explore perceived parental invasions from the view of adolescents in reaction to such issues as control attempts, solicitation of information, and conflict outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Brief Status Report on Communication Privacy Management Theory|last = Petronio|first = Sandra|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Family Communication|accessdate = |doi = 10.1080/15267431.2013.743426|pmid =|volume=13|pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way that family communication uses CPM is with child bearing or the lack thereof; whom childless-couples choose to disclose to that they voluntarily do not want children is another way CPM has been explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durham|first1=Wesley|title=The Rules-Based Process of Revealing/Concealing the Family Planning Decisions of Voluntarily Child-Free Couples: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|journal=Communication Studies|date=May 21, 2008|volume=59|issue=2|pages=132–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy loss due to [[miscarriage]] could be a unique CPM case in the family setting as couples often manage this information jointly as they decide whether to share the miscarriage with people outside the dyad. The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss. Even though couples described their privacy rules as implicitly understood, they also recalled having explicit conversations to develop rules. We discuss how the management of co-owned information can improve communication and maintain relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=100015365&amp;db=ufh|title=Co-ownership of Private Information in the Miscarriage Context|last=Bute, J.

===Online social media===

Recent researchers apply CPM to investigate privacy management for online [[blog]]ging, Facebook usage and [[online dating]]. Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanter|first1=Maggie|last2=Robbins|first2=Stephanie|title=The Impact of Parents "Friending" Their Young Adult Child on Facebook on Perceptions of Parental Privacy Invasions and Parent–Child Relationship Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|date=October 2012|volume=62|issue=5|pages=900–917|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Friends Only: Examining a Privacy-Enhancing Behavior in Facebook|last = Fred Stutzman, Jacob Kramer-Duffield|first = |date = April 2010|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar research has been done on the perceptions of teachers' disclosures on Facebook and their impact on credibility. The relevance and valence of disclosures were compared between disclosures made in the classroom and those made on Facebook and were found to be significantly different. Students' perceptions of teacher credibility were shown to decrease as relevance of disclosures increased and as negativity increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=738c24b7-e7cd-414e-a7c6-b864903d0734%40sessionmgr4009&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=101487383|title=Perceptions of Teachers’ Disclosures on Facebook and their Impact on Credibility|last=Coffelt, T. A., Strayhorn|first=J., &amp; Tillson, L. D|date=2014|website=|publisher=Kentucky Journal of Communication|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular SNS Twitter was examined as well. In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=95546c19-b61c-4971-9aaf-7eea06c2bcb6%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=90180338&amp;db=ufh|title=The roles of virtual identity discrepancy and personality traits in communication privacy management on Twitter|last=Jin, Seung|first=A Annie|date=2013|website=|publisher=New Media &amp; Society|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter). This shows the intricate connection between students' privacy concern and their usage behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=9b8072d1-acbd-46d4-9d13-ec29624248db%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=118972200|title=Exploring the Relationship between Privacy Concerns and Social Media Use among College Students: A Communication Privacy Management Perspective|last=YANG, K. C.|first=PULIDO, A.|date=2016|website=|publisher=Intercultural Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health communication ===

Informed by principles of CPM, health communication research using CPM to explore health privacy issues has become a growth area. Earlier study investigated physician disclosure of medical mistakes. Recently there have been a number of studies focused on ways that privacy issues influence patient care, confidentiality and control over ownership, choices about disclosure, for instance, with stigmatized health-related illness such as [[HIV/AIDS]], about [[e-health]] information, and the [[digitization]] of healthcare.

One recent study about how [[overweight]] and [[obese]] individuals handle their personal history after they become a normal weight. The result shows that the vast majority of participants perceived more benefits from disclosing their larger identity than risks, regardless of weight-loss method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romo|first=Lynsey K|title=How Formerly Overweight and Obese Individuals Negotiate Disclosure of Their Weight Loss|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=b31b1607-b9a5-4eef-a969-8e138716da4d%40sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4207&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=116509531&amp;db=aph|journal=Health Communication|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1145–1154|doi=10.1080/10410236.2015.1045790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using CPM, ''Celebrity Health Narratives &amp; the Public Health'' offers the "first extensive look at celebrity health sagas, this book examines the ways in which their stories become our stories, influencing public perception and framing dialog about wellness, disease and death. These private-yet-public narratives drive fund-raising, reduce stigma and influence policy. Celebrities such as [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]], [[Michael J. Fox]], and [[Christopher Reeve]]—as well as 200 others included in the study—have left a lasting legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7971-9|title=McFarland - a leading independent publisher of academic and nonfiction books|website=www.mcfarlandbooks.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship issues===

Many studies emphasize the use of CPM in relationships because of the concepts of disclosure and boundaries. Not only romantic relationships, but also friendships are a factor when thinking of CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBride|first1=Chad|last2=Bergen|first2=Karla|title=Communication Research: Becoming a Reluctant Confidant: Communication Privacy Management in Close Friendships|journal=Texas Speech Communication Journal|date=2008|volume=33|issue=1|pages=50–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, work on conflict and topic avoidance, considering the relational impact of privacy turbulence, students and faculty relationships, and workplace relationships have all produced useful information that opens new doors regarding CPM-based research.

The mobile phone and its impact on romantic relationships is a good example. After investigating mobile phone usage rules that are negotiated by adolescents and young adults in romantic relationships, findings are that the negotiation of rules is a crucial part of young adult relationships while enhancing trust and fostering harmony were important factors in the rule development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/02500167.2016.1140666|pages= 56–74|title= Mobile communication privacy management in romantic relationships: A dialectical approach|journal= Communicatio|volume= 42|year= 2016|last1= Ngcongo|first1= Mthobeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPM also appears in the friendship. The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=cd2e4976-6af1-4f4e-984f-f0a0953a3789%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=97239961&amp;db=ufh|title=A Profile of Those Likely to Reveal Friends' Confidential Secrets|last=Bello, R. S|first=Brandau-Brown|date=2014|website=|publisher=Communication Studies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although privacy violations can be uncomfortable and disruptive, they have the potential for positive outcomes in relationships if addressed. Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=7f9fc8cf-95ac-4800-b9e5-28c8506b72a3%40sessionmgr107&amp;hid=115&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=103187596&amp;db=ufh|title=Privacy Recalibration in Personal Relationships: Rule Usage Before and After an Incident of Privacy Turbulence|last=Steuber, Keli Ryan|first=Rachel M. McLaren|date=2015|website=|publisher=Communication Quarterly|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work environments===

CPM has become very applicable in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed to be brought to work. The concept of [[Bring your own device|Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)]] has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Seumas|last2=Weckert|first2=John|title=Privacy, the Workplace and the Internet|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=December 2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=255–265|doi=10.1023/a:1006232417265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=K.W.|last2=Voas|first2=J.|last3=Hurlburt|first3=G.F.|title=BYOD: Security and Privacy Considerations|journal=IT Professional|date=Sep–Oct 2012|volume=14|issue=5|pages=53–55|doi=10.1109/mitp.2012.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing. How much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Michael|last2=Kleiner|first2=Brian|title=Conducting an Effective Selection Interview|journal=Work Study|date=1994|volume=43|issue=7|doi=10.1108/eum0000000004009|pages=8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Martine|last2=Wright|first2=Rebecca|last3=Clark|first3=Susan|title=Improving the Competency of Police Officers in Conducting Investigative Interviews with Children|journal=Police Practice &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/15614260902830070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intercultural communication ===
Several studies tested CPM within intercultural contexts.  For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This "study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a "free space" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-08-24|title=Cultural discourses of privacy: Interrogating globalized workplace relationships in Japan|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/17513057.2016.1142601|issn=1751-3057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the same context, foreign English teachers "employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2012-01-01|title=Tales of Gaijin: Health Privacy Perspectives of Foreign English Teachers in Japan|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/kaleidoscope/vol11/iss1/3/|journal=Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research|volume=11|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathaniel|first=Simmons,|date=2014-01-01|title=Negotiating Boundaries in a Globalized World: Communication Privacy Management between Foreign English Teachers and Japanese Co-workers in Japan|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ohiou1400259896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==
There are a few communication theories that are worth noting after understanding CPM in more depth.

[[Expectancy violations theory]] discusses the importance of personal space, [[Territoriality (nonverbal communication)|territoriality]] and the expectations individuals have of another's non verbal communication. Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.

[[Social penetration theory]] explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.

Finally, [[coordinated management of meaning]] explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.

==Academic integration==
Communication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Values ===

Altman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different "levels" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure "turbulence", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.&lt;ref name="Afifi 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S. | last2 = Martin | first2 = J.N. | year = 1986 | title = Ramifications of revealing private information: A gender gap | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 499–506 | doi=10.1002/1097-4679(198605)42:3&lt;499::aid-jclp2270420317&gt;3.0.co;2-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petronio, Martin, Litlefield 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petronio | first1 = S.

=== Criticism ===
Some researchers have questioned whether CPM theory truly is dialectical in nature.  It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms ''balance'' and ''equilibrium'' in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. "Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the ''degrees'' [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.

'''Dramatic monologue''', also known as a [[persona]] poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. [[M.H. Abrams]] notes the following three features of the ''dramatic monologue'' as it applies to poetry:
{{Quotation|
# A single person, who is patently ''not'' the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment […].
# This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker.
# The main principle controlling the poet's choice and formulation of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that enhances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. ed. "Dramatic Monologue." ''A Glossary of Literary Terms.'' 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of dramatic  monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue  is [[romantic poetry]]. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]'', to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting.  The [[conversation poems]] of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], beginning in the latter's case with her long poem ''The Improvisatrice''.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Baiesi. ''Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Metrical Romance'', 2009, p.56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in [[Albert Camus]] ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.

== Examples ==

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After ''Ulysses'', Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are ''Tithonus'', ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' and ''St. Simon Stylites,'' all from the 1842 ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.
*[[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Dover Beach]]'' and ''Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse'' are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing [[scepticism (philosophy)|scepticism]] of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867's ''New Poems.''
*[[Robert Browning]] produced his most famous work in this form. While ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Caliban upon Setebos]]'', ''[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]'' and ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', as well as the other poems in ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' are just a handful of Browning's monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote several, including ''Jenny'' and ''The Blessed Damozel''; [[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a number, including ''The Convent Threshold.'' [[Augusta Webster]]'s ''A Castaway,'' ''Circe'', and ''The Happiest Girl In The World'', [[Amy Levy]]'s ''Xantippe'' and ''A Minor Poet,'' and [[Felicia Hemans]]'s ''Arabella Stuart'' and ''Properzia Rossi'' are all exemplars of this technique. [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'' has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Raven]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]'s [[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]].

Post-Victorian examples include [[William Butler Yeats]]'s ''The Gift of Harun al-Rashid'', [[Elizabeth Bishop]]'s ''Crusoe in England'', and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' and ''[[Gerontion]]''.

'''Facial Angles''' refers to the content of two lectures on this subject by the Amsterdam professor of anatomy [[Petrus Camper]] on the 1st and 8 August in 1770 to the Amsterdam Drawing Academy called the ''Teken-akademie''.

==Background==
Camper was a competent artist and draughtsman who had taken drawing lessons from [[Carel de Moor]] and his son [[Carel Isaak de Moor]] in Leiden, and whose own pupils had been [[Martin van Marum]], [[Johannes le Francq van Berkhey]], and [[Wibrand Veltman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/90470 Petrus Camper] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; His broad interest in the natural sciences had led him to anatomy and he was praelector of the Amsterdam Surgeon's guild, a respected position that placed him also in the Amsterdam ''vroedschap'' or regency. He had published papers and lectures on a variety of anatomy subjects, and came to the lectures with several engraved examples of popular art that he wanted to discuss on the basis of anatomy. He brought with him the skull of a baby, child, man, and elderly man, and two large canvasses with sketched drawings of the mathematical dimensions of the human head.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G-oEAAAAQAAJ Vaderlandse Oefeningen, 1770 (Google Books)], report by Cornelis Ploos van Amstel, pp 386-393&lt;/ref&gt;

==On traditional drawing lessons==
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Retour sur soi-même.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze|Greuze]]'s "Retour sur soi-même" was an example of a bad likeness of the head of an old woman, because classical drawing theory was applied which was based on a young adult male's head. Merely adding wrinkles and a costume cannot help a poor likeness.]]
[[File:Jan de Visscher- de moor.jpg|thumb|''The Moor'', an etching by [[Jan de Visscher]] after a drawing by his brother [[Cornelis Visscher|Cornelis]]]]
Camper's main points in his first lecture were that classical drawing lessons from the time of ''[[Vitruvius]]'', including the teachings of ''[[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]]'' and ''[[Charles Perrault|Perreault]]'', were based on an incorrect assumption that the human head was oval at all ages, and he proceeded to prove this with his dimensions of the skulls. He also remarked that none of the various humans of modern "nations" such as Europeans, [[Moors]] or [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] people adhere to the classic form of head so remarkable in Grecian sculpture. The travelogues of ''[[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]]'' and ''[[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon|de Buffon]]'' made mention of practises in infancy which caused these national characteristics, such as Chinese women pulling their eye lids to the sides, or African Moors pressing their noses flat, or Europeans pressing their ears flat with caps tied tight. Camper claimed this was all nonsense and the forms of people's faces (and their skulls) were related to their living environments. He then proceeded to demonstrate on his sketches, by shortening the chin he could transform a likeness of a man to an old man, and by adjusting the facial angle, he changed a Moor into a European, and he was so successful in this demonstration with a few lines of chalk, that the hall cheered.

==A new drawing method based on facial angle==
His first lecture had dwelled on the skull's form among ages and among these three nations, and the second lecture (which was so well populated by students that the hall proved too small) was intended as a practical guide how to better make portraits that looked like the subject. For this he brought with him more sketches in the same dimensions as the first two that by means of arrangement along the dimension lines could be easily compared for sketching. He discussed the classical facial angle using the plaster cast of Apollo that was in the lecture hall.

The artist-collector [[Cornelis Ploos van Amstel]] first published notes on Camper's lectures in the Leiden literature society proceedings in 1770 in which a book was promised with engravings, and though [[Reinier Vinkeles]] made engravings for this purpose in 1785, a book was only posthumously published by Camper's son [[Adriaan Gilles Camper]] in 1791 after Camper senior died.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Petrus Camper facial angles by son Adriaan Gilles - orangutan to moor.jpg|...'' the second canvas had the heads of two apes, an African Moor and a Kalmyk or Asian, again with their skulls drawn above them...
File:Petrus Camper facial angles by son Adriaan Gilles - europeaan tot antiek.jpg|..''and again a canvas was brought out with three heads next to each other in profile with varying facial angles; 80 degrees, 90 degrees, and 100 degrees''...

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Bernard Picart - Sophocles Medusa - Philipp von Stosch - Pierres antiques gravées.png|thumb|left|The "monstrous" Medusa with 100 degree facial angle]]
Camper's work was later quoted again and again, and his engraved drawings were used to prove that he had tried to show a hierarchy of facial angles from the orangutan to the European, but this was never part of either of the two lectures. In fact, he was only trying to help artists make better portraits, and remarked that of all the great masters of art that can be observed in engravings such as ''[[Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyk]]'', and ''[[Jacob Jordaens|Jordaans]]'' only the Haarlemmer [[Cornelis Visscher]] had ever been able to draw the head of a Moor correctly.

Though [[Georges Cuvier]] felt that Camper's sketches showed the superiority of the white man in beauty as being the closest to the Classic ideal, this was against the views of Camper. Camper claimed that both edges of the spectrum were monsters, which is to say that orangutans and apes (with facial angle 42-50 degrees) were just as ugly as Sophocles' [[Medusa]] engraved in profile by [[Bernard Picart]] for [[Philipp von Stosch]]'s "Pierres Antiques Gravées". The facial angles of Moors and Kalmyks was calculated to be 70 degrees, and that of a European 80 degrees.

The original report of these lectures in the proceedings of the literature society is listed as one of the 1000 most important texts in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]].

The one-term '''postgraduate certificate''' program offers complementary studies in public management. It is aimed at young and future government officials holding a graduate-level degree. It resembles the first semester of the Master of Administrative Sciences program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-3%20Mon.htm|title= The one-term course|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Administrative Sciences''' (''Magister rerum publicarum'') is the school's traditional flagship program. It is a one-year [[postgraduate]] program open to students holding an additional graduate-level degree, preferably in  law, economics, history, or sociology. Students can choose from some 100 courses that are divided into five policy areas: 1. Public tasks, Organization and Proceedings, 2. Public Management, 3. European and International Affairs, 4. State and Economy, and 5. Higher Education and Research Management. The program comprises two terms at the school, an eight-week internship at German or European institutions, and a subsequent period of three months to write the master's thesis and pass an oral examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-M-P.htm|title= Magister rerum publicarum |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; International student enrollment in this program regularly hovers around 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;consisting of 35 % Asian, 30 % European, 25 % African, and 10 % American students (Data as of 2004).{{cite web |url=http://mifkjf.rlp.de/fileadmin/mifkjf/Integration/Daten_und_Fakten/1.ZuwBericht_Teil_C_und_Anhang.pdf|title= Immigration Report - Part C|accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=Rhineland Palatinate Ministry of Education website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Arts in Administrative Sciences'''  is a two-year interdisciplinary program focusing on public administration in  an international context. First year students follow a core curriculum consisting of six modules on administrative, legal, economic, methodological, and strategic topics, and complete a mandatory eight-week internship. In the second year, students choose courses from the following six optional modules: 1. Government and Administration, 2. Public Policy, 3. Europeanization and Internationalization of Public Administration, 4. Organization and Personnel, 5. Funding of Public Services, and 6. Competition and Regulation in the Infrastructure Sector. At the end of the second year, students complete the master's thesis.&lt;ref name = MAAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-MasterAS.htm|title= M.A. in Administrative Sciences |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Arts in Public Economy''' is a two-year program dedicated to the study of the [[Public economics|public economic sector]] from an interdisciplinary perspective. During the first year, students follow the core curriculum of the M.A. in Administrative Sciences. Second-year students complete four deepening modules in Public Finance, Competition and Regulation, Procurement, and Public Corporate Governance, choose one optional module on Public Enterprises, or Infrastructure, and write a master's thesis.&lt;ref name = MAPE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-MasterOEW.htm|title= M.A. in Public Economy |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both M.A. programs also offer a one-year option for students holding a previous relevant master's degree. The '''Master of Public Administration in Higher Education and Research Management''' is a two-year part-time program for professional university or research institute administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wissenschaftsmanagement-speyer.de/|title= MPA in Higher Education and Research Management |accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university runs '''doctoral programs''' in administrative sciences (''[[Doctor of Science|Doctor rerum publicarum]]''), law (''[[Doctor of Law|Doctor juris]]''), and political sciences and economy (''[[Doctor of Science|Doctor rerum politicarum]]''). Doctoral candidates are required to complete one year of coursework in residence at the school, and produce a dissertation which makes a creditable contribution to scholarship in its field. The dissertation must be supervised by a member of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/studies-Doc.htm|title= Doctoral studies|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's '''executive education''' provides in-service training for senior civil servants of all government levels. The seminars, workshops and conferences deal with contemporary problems of administration, legislation, and European affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.dhv-speyer.de/ENGL/continuing%20education.htm|title=Executive education|accessdate=2012-04-04 |work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Speyer Leadership College''' (''Führungskolleg Speyer'') is a two-year in-service program preparing senior executives holding at least the rank of a ''Government Director''&lt;ref&gt;''Regierungsdirektor (A15)''; equivalent to [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|U.S. GS-14 / O-5 positions]]&lt;/ref&gt; to assume higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dhv-speyer.de/fks/index.htm|title=Speyer Leadership College|accessdate=2012-04-04 |language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admission and fees==
Admission to the school is competitive and is limited to 25 seats per program and year for the M.A. programs, and to 60 seats for the Master in Administrative Sciences program. Formal minimum entry requirement for all degree programs is a [[class rank]] among the top third in the previous [[academic degree]] program. Professional administrative experience is considered an asset. For prospective [[international student]]s, a [[language test]] for German at [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|CEFR C1 level]] is required.&lt;ref name=MAAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=MAPE/&gt;

The German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unifr.ch/ztd/ems/doc/FAQ_EMS_NC.pdf|title=Test Scores versus School Grades as Selection Criteria: Paternoster-Effect, Filter-Effect, Cost-Benefit-Effects and Effects on the Fairness of Admissions|accessdate=2012-04-20|format = pdf|language = German|work=University of Fribourg website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most German [[public university|public universities]], Speyer charges no [[tuition fee]]s for academic programs, for both [[European Union|EU]] and non-EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Note: As of 2012, only public universities in [[Bavaria]] and [[Lower Saxony]] continue to charge tuition fees for undergraduate and academic consecutive graduate programs. {{cite web |url=http://www.bildungsspiegel.de/aktuelles/rheinland-pfalz-neues-hochschulgesetz-soll-studiengebuehren-ab-2012-abschaffen.html?Itemid=262 |title=Rhineland Palatinate: New higher education act to abolish tuition fees from spring term 2012 onwards|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=bildungsspiegel.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the professional M.P.A. in Higher Education and Research Management program, the school charges  €8,000 in tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://wissenschaftsmanagement-speyer.de/bewerbung-kosten/|title=M.P.A. in Higher Education and Research Management - Application and fees|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual housing costs for on-campus [[dormitory|dormitories]] range from €1,560 to €3,240.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dhv-speyer.de/Studium/Vormsemester/Unterbringung.htm|title=Student Dormitories|accessdate=2012-04-20|language = German|work=Speyer University website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis''' (1965 to 1991) pioneered early [[cartography|cartographic]] and architectural computer applications that led to integrated [[GIS|geographic information systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/81657/859797671-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 |format=PDF |title=Stratified, Destratified, and Hybrid GIS: Organizing a Cross-Disciplinary Territory for Design |publisher=Dspace.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the Laboratory's influential programs included SYMAP, SYMVU, GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT.  The Laboratory's Odyssey project created a [[geographic information system]] that served as a milestone in the development of integrated mapping systems.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisman, Nick, [http://downloads2.esri.com/ESRIpress/images/82/HarvardBLAD_screen.pdf "Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping At Harvard Became GIS"], ESRI (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory influenced numerous computer graphic, mapping and architectural systems such as [[Intergraph]], [[Computervision]], and [[Esri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu/publish_web/CGA_Conferences/2015_Lab_Legacy/2015_CGA_Conference_Program.pdf |format=PDF |title=CGA Conference 2015 |publisher=Cga-download.hmdc.harvard.edu |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
In 1963, during a training session held at [[Northwestern University]], [[Chicago]] architect [[Howard T. Fisher]] encountered computer maps on [[urban planning]] and [[civil engineering]] produced by Edgar Horwood's group at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/1/26/howard-fisher-gsd-proffessor-dies-at/|title=Howard Fisher, GSD Proffessor, Dies at 75|work=thecrimson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher conceived a computer mapping software program, SYMAP (Synergistic Mapping), to produce conformant, proximal, and contour maps on a line printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health Based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their Applications | pmc=4315644 | pmid=25684850 | doi=10.5455/aim.2014.22.402-405 | volume=22 | year=2014 | journal=Acta Inform Med | pages=402–5 | last1 = Fradelos | first1 = EC | last2 = Papathanasiou | first2 = IV | last3 = Mitsi | first3 = D | last4 = Tsaras | first4 = K | last5 = Kleisiaris | first5 = CF | last6 = Kourkouta | first6 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisher applied for a [[Ford Foundation]] grant to explore thematic mapping based on early SYMAP outputs, which was awarded in 1965.  In association with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] providing facilities in Robinson Hall in [[Harvard Yard]] as part of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/projects/when-the-gsd-designed-software-experiments-in-computer-vision.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ford Foundation provided $294,000 over three years to seed the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics.  Working with programmer Betty Benson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gisandscience.com/2009/11/17/charting-the-unknown-how-computer-mapping-at-harvard-became-gis/|title=Charting the Unknown: How Computer Mapping at Harvard Became GIS|work=GIS and Science|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher completed SYMAP for distribution in 1966.  Also under Fisher's direction, SYMVU and GRID programs were developed.  A 1968 reorganisation followed Fisher reaching Harvard's mandatory retirement age and led to renaming as the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.  From 1972, the Laboratory was based in Graduate School's newly built Gund Hall.

The Laboratory's original and continuing goals were:
# To design and develop computer software for the analysis and graphic display of spatial data.
# To distribute the resulting software to governmental agencies, educational organizations and interested professionals.
# To conduct research concerning the definition and analysis of spatial structure and process."&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1978, Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major research outputs==
[[File:SYMAP - LAB-LOG 1980.png|thumb|SYMAP - comparison of conformant, contour, proximal, and trend surface outputs]]SYMAP's ability to print cheap, albeit low quality, maps using readily available technology led to rapid adoption in the late 1960s.  SYMVU software, developed in 1969 to illustrate surface displays, was another popular product.  GRID, CALFORM, and POLYVRT products further explored the raster versus vector approach to mapping.  The Laboratory gained a reputation for solid output leading to several commercially successful projects and significant budgetary independence for a [[research institute]].  Some struggles with restructuring Geographic Base Files - Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF-DIME files, an early vector and polygonal data structure) for the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau's]] Urban Atlas in 1975 inspired the Laboratory to develop an integrated suite of programs beneath by a common user interface and common data manipulation software.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Allan H, "Shareable Data Bases Key For Effective Mapmaking", Computerworld, 8 May 1978, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 this suite became the Odyssey project.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Anne M, "A New ODYSSEY Begun", Context #10", Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1979), pages 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Odyssey project's aim was to produce a vector GIS that provided [[spatial analysis]] of many different forms within a single system.

As of 1980, in addition to early Odyssey modules, the Laboratory sold the following programs for display and analysis of spatial data&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1980, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ASPEX - 3d data perspectives;
* CALFORM - shaded vector maps;
* DOT.MAP - contour, shaded, and dot-distribution maps from gridded data;
* KWIC - key-word-in-context programs for indexing bibliographic references;
* POLYVRT - data conversion and analysis of polygonal data;
* SYMAP - line printer mapping producing conformant (areas), contour, trend surface, and proximal (also known as [[Voronoi diagram]] or Thiessan polygonal)
* GIMMS (Geographic Information Management and Mapping System) - a general purpose mapping system written by Tom Waugh at the [[University of Edinburgh]];
* MDS(X) - a multidimensional pattern detection and scaling system under the direction of Tony Coxon at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff]].

The 1982 release of Odyssey included seven programs for geographical analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics:a Poster Exhibit|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic39008.files/History_LCG.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Isites.harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the Laboratory's software, it was written in [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] and operated on several platforms. The POLYPS and PRISM modules could draw maps on a variety of vector display devices.
* PROTEUS - editing, projections, generalization, aggregation, simple display;
* CYCLONE - topological checking of nodes, error correction;
* CYCLOPS - topological checking of polygons, produce graphics shape files;
* WHIRLPOOL - planar enforcement: overlay, error detection of input;
* CALYPSO - attribute manipulations (areal interpolation);
* POLYPS - planar choropleth maps;
* PRISM - raised 3d prism maps.

==Activities==
The Laboratory distributed software, and later data, at cost, thus encouraging experimentation.  The Laboratory conducted correspondence courses, hosted numerous conferences, and worked on environmental planning and architectural projects with the Harvard Graduate School of Design.  From 1978 to 1983, the Laboratory hosted a popular annual Harvard Computer Graphics Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/Harvard/general.pdf |format=PDF |title=Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis |publisher=Vasulka.org |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Geoffrey Dutton, a Research Associate at the Laboratory from 1969 through 1984, created the first holographic thematic map, "America Graph Fleeting" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?term=holographic&amp;module=objects&amp;type=keyword&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;page=5&amp;kv=71277&amp;record=208&amp;module=objects|title=MIT Museum|work=Mit.edu|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rotating strip of 3,000 holograms depicted an animated sequence of 3d maps showing US population growth from 1790 to 1970, generated by the Laboratory's ASPEX program. Dutton also contributed the program DOT.MAP to the Laboratory's family of distributed software (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Extensible Approach to Imagery of Gridded Data|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/563858.563886|publisher = ACM|journal = SIGGRAPH '77 Proceedings|date = 1977|location = New York, NY, USA|pages = 159–169|doi = 10.1145/563858.563886|first = Geoffrey|last = Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977 James Dougenik, Duane Niemeyer, and Nicholas Chrisman developed contiguous area cartograms.&lt;ref&gt;"Context 1982-83", Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, Harvard College (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bruce Donald]], working at the Laboratory from 1978 to 1984, wrote BUILDER, a program for computer-aided architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Bruce, "BUILDER: A Database and Display Program for Computer-aided Architectural Design" (a system for representation and display of design problems in architecture and urban design), Harvard Computer Graphics Conference, Session 17, Architectural Practice (27 July 27, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cs.duke.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/ |title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics |publisher=Cs.duke.edu |date=1982-07-27 |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BUILDER produced plan and shaded perspectives that popularised computer-aided-design in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/Historical/hlcg/|title=Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics|work=cs.duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/brd/papers/index.html#Builder|title=Bruce R.

The early period of the Laboratory saw staff numbers grow to approximately 40 in 1970, but shrink to half a dozen by 1972 as grants expired.  The Odyssey project grew the Laboratory from about 12 people in 1977&lt;ref&gt;LAB-LOG 1977, Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis, Harvard College (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; to forty people by 1981.  The Laboratory shrank significantly back to approximately half a dozen people from 1982 until its closure in June 1991.

==Later period and influence==
From 1979 the Laboratory was encouraged to develop external software sales and entered into licensing agreements for this purpose, most notably with Synercom and ISSCO Corporation (sold to [[Computer associates|Computer Associates]] in 1987) for Odyssey.  However, the licensing agreements had weak to non-existent technology exploitation and non-compete clauses, so potential purchasers were frustrated in attempting to license from a competitor often preferentially positioning its proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~gisteac/ilw/generic_resources/books_and_papers/Thx1ARTICLE.pdf |format=PDF |title=The History of GIS |publisher=Geos.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential purchasers often redeveloped Odyssey functions rather than wait for licenses.  Meanwhile, having carved out the potential commercial interests, from 1981 the Harvard Graduate School of Design sought less commercial work and an increased focus on research, though with reduced budgets.  "But the timing of this burgeoning commercialism of the Lab's activities collided with the moment in history when Harvard's President [[Derek Bok]] set out to clarify the blurred lines between academic research and development on the one hand, and more clearly defined commercial activities on the other."&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Eric, "Notes On Leaving Harvard: An Insider's View", Computer Graphics News (November/December 1981), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Financial strain and the lack of commercial inspiration for projects led to the dispersal of many team members from 1981.  Despite some further research during the late 1980s, the Laboratory closed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html/ |accessdate=August 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918043755/http://www.ncgia.buffalo.edu/gishist/bar_harbor.html |archivedate=September 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Morehouse, the development lead for the Odyssey project, worked at the lab from 1977 to 1981. When revenues from Odyssey did not meet expectations, his team's resources started to dwindle, and Morehouse left to join Jack at Esri to build a next-generation GIS platform that was to be ArcInfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucgis.org/ucgis-fellow/scott-morehouse|title=Scott Morehouse - UCGIS|work=Ucgis.org|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's intimate knowledge of the Odyssey geoprocessing model and code base, combined with Jack's insights into how to put the 'IS' in 'GIS' evolved the Laboratory's GIS prototype processors into a system that could effectively and interactively manage, process, edit, and display vector geodata and its scalar attributes that addressed evolving market needs for more robust GIS capabilities.

The '''Hawai`i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB)''' is  a marine biology laboratory located on the state-owned [[Coconut Island]] in [[Kāne'ohe Bay]].

==History==
The institute was established in 1912. It began as a wooden structure on the shores of [[Waikiki]] and originally functioned in conjunction with the [[Waikiki Aquarium]] until 1919 when both operations became part of the University of Hawai‘i. In 1947 a group of wealthy oil tycoons, including [[Edwin W. Pauley]], bought Coconut Island. Pauley donated a part of the island to the University for use as a marine laboratory for the study of the [[oceanography|marine sciences]].&lt;ref name=soest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UHMEnergy/Campus%20Energy%20Projects/Coconut%20Island.html|title=HIMB - A Brief History of Coconut Island|website=www.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993, the Pauley family donated the remaining private part of Coconut Island for the construction of a world-class marine laboratory.&lt;ref name=soest/&gt;

In 2008, the institute was seeking 57 million dollars through state-issued bonds for the construction of a {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} marine research facility. The site is on the southeast side of the island. This is part of the master plan approved by the University of Hawaii's Board of Regents in 1998, which includes the addition of several research buildings, laboratories, and conference facilities. These will be funded on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2008/02/25/focus3.html?jst=pn_pn_lk|title=$57 million in bonds would fund Coconut Island facility|website=bizjournals.com|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Kalani, Nanea|date=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to turn Coconut Island into the world's premier [[coral reef]] research facility.&lt;ref name=honoluladvert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Aug/01/ln/ln34a.html|title=Coconut Island impact study under way - The Honolulu Advertiser - Hawaii's Newspaper|work=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Aguiar, Eloise|date=August 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Coconut Island is approximately {{convert|29|acre|m2}}, including {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of enclosed lagoons used to keep organisms being studied in captivity. Surrounding it are {{convert|64|acre|m2}} of [[coral reef]], designated by the state of Hawai‘i as the Hawai‘i Marine Laboratory Refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dar/regulated-areas/coconut-island-hawaii-marine-laboratory-refuge/|title=Coconut Island – Hawai‘i Marine Laboratory Refuge|publisher=[[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/|title=Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology|publisher=www.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only research facility in the world built on a coral reef.&lt;ref name=honoluladvert/&gt;

The boundaries of the Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge surrounding the island start at the high-water mark on the island and go to twenty-five feet beyond the outer edges of the reefs, including sand and seawall shoreline, where [[coral]] and [[calcium carbonate|sand calcium carbonate]] [[reef|reef flats]] are exposed at low tides. High coral and macro-algae flourish at shallow-depth zones while the deep habitats are characterized by [[sediment]] with low coral cover and colonized by [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing from upper reef zones. Within Kaneohe Bay are sheltered areas. Man-made impacts in the area include [[dredging]], sewage release and freshwater flooding. The shores of the bay are characterized by coastal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.mpa.gov/exploreinv/SiteProfile4.aspx?SiteID=HI22|title=Site Profile - Moku-o-loe Island (Coconut Island)|publisher=www3.mpa.gov|accessdate=April 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220172810/http://www3.mpa.gov/exploreinv/SiteProfile4.aspx?SiteID=HI22|archivedate=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
The HIMB research facilities are used to explore deep-sea habitats where new species may be discovered and documented, as well as shallow reefs which are rich habitats likely to contain undiscovered species.&lt;ref name=nationalmarine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngsednet.org/workshop_details.cfm?w_id=27|title=National Marine Sanctuary Field Study|website=www.ngsednet.org|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812215812/http://www.ngsednet.org/workshop_details.cfm?w_id=27|archivedate=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Hawai‘i Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) is located at HIMB. It established a statewide network of more than 30   long-term coral reef monitoring sites with associated data collection systems. It went on to include rapid [[quantitative research]] and [[habitat]] mapping, which are tools new used to understand the ecology of the Hawaiian coral reefs in relation to surrounding geographic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cramp.wcc.hawaii.edu/|title=Hawaii Coral Reef Assessment &amp; Monitoring Program (CRAMP) Home|publisher=cramp.wcc.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of the HIMB research projects is on the effects of sound on [[dolphin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://starbulletin.com/2007/09/03/news/story04.html|title=UH tests sonar on sea mammals|date=September 3, 2007|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Kakesako, Gregg K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/jun04/noaa04-r155.html|title=NOAA Scientists Continue Nationwide Lecture Series on Human Noise Impact to Marine Mammals|website=www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov|date=June 4, 2004|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archivedate=September 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917164821/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/jun04/noaa04-r155.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:260D.jpg|right|thumb|The Mercedes-Benz 260D.]]

Diesel engines began to be used in automobiles in the 1930s.  Mainly used for commercial applications early on, they did not gain popularity for passenger travel until their development in Europe in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question399.htm If diesel engines are more efficient, why do most cars come with gasoline engines?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Diesel cars continue to develop into highly desired, high performance while retaining power and performance. In terms of pollution, diesel engines generally produce less carbon dioxide than gasoline-based engines but produce more nitrous oxides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have diesel cars been unfairly demonised for air pollution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/11/have-diesel-cars-been-unfairly-demonised-for-air-pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[Charles Chapman (engineer)|Charles Wallace Chapman]] at Perkins Engines at [[Peterborough]], England, developed an engine, the high speed diesel engine, for automobiles; previously diesel engines were too large and heavy.

Production '''diesel car history''' started in 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citroen's Rosalie becomes the world's first commercially available diesel engined passenger car|url=http://www.nu-car.com/Diesel_Buyers_Guide/Diesel_Timeline.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The world's first mass-produced diesel car |url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uL1FQoM8?url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Misc/Ricardo.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Citroën]]'s [[Citroën 7U|Rosalie]], which featured a diesel engine option (the 1,766&amp;nbsp;cc 11UD engine) in the Familiale (estate or station wagon) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cats-citroen.net/citroen/history.html#UA |title=Cats Citroën Net History |publisher=Cats-citroen.net |date=1934-05-03 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mercedes-Benz 260 D|Mercedes-Benz 260D]] and the [[Hanomag]] Rekord were introduced in 1936.

Immediately after World War II, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, diesel-powered cars began to gain limited popularity, particularly for commercial applications, such as ambulances, taxis, and station wagons used for delivery work.  Most were conventional in design.  Mercedes-Benz offered a continuous stream of diesel-powered taxis, beginning in 1949 with their 170D powered by the OM-636 engine. Later, in 1959 their OM-621 engine was introduced in the 180D. This 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine produced {{convert|55|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 4,350&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Beginning in 1959, Peugeot offered the 403D with their TMD-85 four-cylinder engine of 1.8&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|48|PS|kW|abbr=on}}, followed in 1962 by the 404D with the same engine. In 1964, the 404D became available with the improved XD88 four-cylinder engine of 2.0&amp;nbsp;L and {{convert|60|PS|kW|abbr=on}}. Other cars available with diesel power during this era included the Austin A60 Cambridge, [[Isuzu Bellel]], Fiat 1400-A, Standard Vanguard, Borgward Hansa, and a few others.

In 1967, Peugeot introduced the world's first compact, high-speed diesel car, the Peugeot 204BD.  Its 1.3&amp;nbsp;L XL4D engine produces {{convert|46|PS|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. Following the 1970s oil crisis ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]), Volkswagen introduced their first diesel, the [[VW Golf]], with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L naturally aspirated indirect-injection engine which was a redesigned (dieselised) version of a gasoline engine. Mercedes-Benz tested turbodiesels in cars (e.g. by the [[Mercedes-Benz C111]] experimental and record-setting vehicles) and the first production [[turbo diesel]] cars were, in 1978, the 3.0 5-cylinder 115&amp;nbsp;hp (86&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Mercedes-Benz W116|Mercedes 300 SD]], available only in North America, and the [[Peugeot 604]].

The biggest single step forward for mass-market diesel cars came in 1982 when PSA Peugeot Citroën introduced the [[XUD]] engine in the [[Peugeot 305]], [[Peugeot 205]] and [[Talbot Horizon]]. This was the class leading automotive diesel engine until the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, July edition, 1993), p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The first mass market turbo diesel was the XUD powered, 1988 [[Citroën BX]] and then the 1989 [[Peugeot 405]], they gave power and refinement approaching petrol engine standards,&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; with the best chassis in their class.  Diesel Car magazine said of the Citroën BX "We can think of no other car currently on sale in the UK that comes anywhere near approaching the BX Turbo's combination of performance, accommodation and economy".&lt;ref&gt;"Diesel Car" (Future Publishing Limited, August/September edition, 1998), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; These were the cars that started the diesel boom in Europe that has now hit 50% of the market in new car sales.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Diesels carried a 2.5% share of the European Community market in 1973. Following the fuel crisis, this share increased to 4.1% in 1975. This more than doubled (to 8.6%) by 1980, and by 1983 diesels represented 11% of new car sales in the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=Moniteur&gt;{{cite journal | ref = Moniteur | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 20 | title = Citroën BX 19 TRD | last = Pirotte | first = Marcel | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 35 | number = 793 | date = 1984-04-19 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel Powered Passenger Cars in North America have been steadily increasing in popularity, especially in the early-mid 2000s.  Diesels have typically only been used in trucks and commercial vehicles and buses.   Jeep had offered a Perkins Diesel option for its models in the early 1960s and Chrysler offered them as well although mainly for the European market though some have probably been retrofitted to older AMC and Chrysler models in the US, particularly as taxis.  Oldsmobile released a 350 cubic Inch (5.7 Litre) V8 diesel Engine starting in the late 1970s, most Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Chevrolet and even Cadillac divisions of General Motors, had received this engine by the 1980 model year, and continued to be sold until the engine was discontinued in 1985.  Whilst a very good idea at the time, owing to the recent 1979 energy crisis these engines had gained a terrible reputation for reliability.  Part of this had to do with the fact that, whilst the engine block itself was indeed a diesel specific design (contrary to most people's belief that it was simply a dieselised version of the famous rocket V8), GM management made significant cost saving measures by using many parts from the gas V8 counterpart which were not up to the task of diesel engine operation, specifically the number and type of head bolts used, and the lack of a water and fuel separator in the fuel line, a big issue as a lot of diesel fuel contained water and also high levels of sulfur at the time.  The engine was later revised into the DX block and most of the issues were fixed, a V6 version displacing 4.3 litres and a smaller 4.3 V8 were also offered around this time, mainly for the downsized front-wheel drive models of the mid-1980s and although they were much better in the reliability department, the damage had already been done and the North American diesel car market was severely crippled as a result, despite the best efforts by Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Peugeot, VW and others in offering their more refined and powerful diesel engines.  All of these olds designed units were non-turbocharged (or natural-aspirated) diesels.  This undoubtedly hampered them in the performance and efficiency departments, although there have been retrofits of turbochargers to Olds diesel blocks which are carried out by enthusiasts and collectors of these cars.  It isn't well proven if turbos are reliable long-term with these engines, but so far they seem to be suitable, however, what performance benefit they bring could be considered as dubious given how low their power output was to begin with.

==1990s and the present==
Diesels steadily gained in acceptance with private buyers in the 1970s and into the 1990s. Having originally been mainly marketed to commercial users such as taxi drivers, European diesel sales increased steadily and reached 17.3 per cent of the overall European market by 1992.&lt;ref name=NZCarp16&gt;{{cite journal | ref = NZC493 | journal = New Zealand Car | title = Newsline | page = 16 | volume = 7 | number = 6 | date = April 1993 | editor-last = Anderson | editor-first = Donn | location = Auckland, New Zealand | publisher = Accent Publishing Cnr | issn = 0113-0196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Audi]] enthusiasts claim that the [[Audi 100]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] was the first turbo charged direct injection diesel sold in 1989, but actually it isn't true, as the [[Fiat Croma]] TD-i.d. was sold with turbo direct injection in 1987&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Technology Heritage|url=http://www.fiat.co.uk/innovations/air-technologies/fiat-technology-heritage/|accessdate=2012-03-16|work=fiat.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one year later [[Austin Rover]] [[Austin Montego|Montego]].&lt;ref name="austin-rover.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?lm10storyf.htm|title=Maestro/Montego|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=austin-rover.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was pioneering about the Audi 100, however, was the use of electronic control of the engine, as the Fiat and Austin had Bosch mechanically controlled injection. In the writers experience the Audi 100&amp;nbsp;TDI was very troublesome and the engine code "AAT" is often known as the difficult Audi .{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The electronic control of direct injection really made a difference in terms of emissions, refinement and power. All earlier generation car direct injection diesel engines benefit greatly from the use of biodiesel fuel, which reduces emissions and greatly improves refinement without engine modifications, provided they use compatible 'Viton' type rubber in their fuel systems.

The diesel car markets are the same ones who pioneered various developments (Mercedes-Benz, [[BMW]], [[Peugeot]]/[[Citroën]], [[Fiat]], [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Volkswagen Group]]) There were also small diesel engines produced in England by British Leyland and Perkins.  For reasons of economy the petrol BMC "B" series engine was dieselised and produced in capacities of 1.5 and 1.8 litres.  Perkins produced the 4.99, 4.107 and 4.108 engines all of which were extremely reliable. Later BL produced the five main bearing "O" series engine which was extremely strong. Petrol turbo variants could make 200HP and the engine was ideal for converting to a diesel.  In fact, the 1988 Austin-Rover MDi unit (also known as the 'Perkins Prima') was developed by [[Perkins Engines]] of [[Peterborough]], who have designed and built high-speed diesels since the 1930s. It is still in production as a marine engine however in the writers opinion timing belts at sea are not a good idea. Engines that rely on timing belts are more suited to inland waterways. It is not easy to make a lightweight and powerful top class diesel engine owing to the immense pressures and heat produced within the engine. These problems were solved by VM Motori of Cento and the engines were apparently so good that Rover, Ford and Jeep bought them.  The interesting features of the engines were the tunnel-bore block and separate cylinder heads to allow for expansion. VM engines were marinised by BMW and sold as BMW stern-drive packages. Mercury Marine also used the VM engines. As they have aged in car applications, they have developed a reputation for blowing head gaskets, due to the separate cylinder head design.

In 1997, the first [[common rail]] diesel passenger car was introduced, the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].&lt;ref name="autonews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/files/07_ane_ptc/speakers.html|title=New Powertrain Technologies Conference|accessdate=2008-04-08|work=autonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, for the very first time in the history of racing, in the legendary [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] race, a diesel-powered car was the overall winner: the BMW works team 320d, a [[BMW E36]] fitted with modern high-pressure diesel injection technology from [[Robert Bosch GmbH]]. The low fuel consumption and long range, allowing 4 hours of racing at once, made it a winner, as comparable petrol-powered cars spent more time refueling.

Chrysler put a [http://www.vmmotori.it/en/01/00/01/dettaglio.jsp?id=11 VM Motori SpA] engine in the [[Jeep Liberty#CRD in North America|Jeep Liberty]] sport utility vehicle in 2005 and 2006 to assess the American market's interest in modern high performance diesel engines.

In 2004 Honda released their first diesel engine, the N22A branded as the i-CTDI, it first featured in the Honda Accord.   The engine featured an aluminium block, DOHC chain driven valvetrain, common rail direct injection and variable geometry turbocharger.
 
In Spring 2005, Mercedes-Benz unveiled their first application of a mass-produced aluminum block diesel engine for passenger vehicles and commercial use. While aluminum is traditionally considered of inferior strength and temperature resistance to withstand diesel applications, Mercedes engineers made extensive use of CAD/CAM design to arrive at an aluminum block that would meet with Mercedes' testing and reliability standards. First use was in 2006 model-year vehicles in the E-Class sedan and ML-class and GL-class SUVs. Similar in weight ({{convert|208|kg|lb|abbr=on}}) to the five-cylinder it replaced, and considerably lighter than the in-line six-cylinder it also replaced, this 3.0L V-6 produces 165&amp;nbsp;kW (224&amp;nbsp;hp) at 3,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and max torque of 510 Nm (376&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf) at 1,600-2,800&amp;nbsp;rpm and makes use of a four-valve head. Additionally, fitment of Mercedes-Benz [[BlueTec]] system, a concert of emissions control strategies, renders this new diesel 50-state legal in the U.S. beginning in 2008 (stringent [[NOx]] limits have made U.S. passenger-car diesels unpopular or impossible in parts of the U.S. in recent years).

In 2006, the new [[Audi R10|Audi R10 TDI LMP1]] entered by [[Joest Racing]] became the first diesel-engined car to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The winning car also bettered the post-1990 course configuration lap record by 1, at 380 laps. However, this fell short of the all-time distance record set in 1971 by over {{convert|200|km}}.

The [[Subaru]] car company of Japan is preparing to sell its [[station wagon]] version of their Legacy mid-size car (called the [[Subaru Outback]] in North America) with a 2.0-litre, [[boxer engine]] format opposed-four-cylinder diesel engine of {{convert|110|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} power, and {{convert|350|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} of torque, in the [[United Kingdom]]. Sales in continental Europe started in 2008.

Since the numerous [[Diesel emissions scandal]]s of recent years the most high profile of which was the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]] of 2015 it has been revealed that the levels of toxic emissions coming from diesel cars are higher and pose a greater risk to human health than those of vehicles powered by other means.

== Diesel engine vehicle racing ==
Although the weight and lower output of a diesel engine tend to keep them away from automotive racing applications, there are many diesels being raced in classes that call for them, mainly in [[truck]] racing and [[tractor pulling]], as well in types of racing where these drawbacks are less severe, such as [[land speed record]] racing or [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]]. Even diesel-engined dragsters exist, despite the diesel's drawbacks of weight and low peak rpm, specifications central to performance in this sport. However, in 2006, the new [[Audi R10 TDI]] LMP1 entered by Joest Racing became the first diesel-engined car to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dieselworldmag.com/content/view/62/ | title = World's First 7-Second Diesel Dragster | journal = Diesel World Magazine |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic ===
As early as 1931, [[Clessie Cummins]] installed his diesel in the Cummins "Diesel Special" race car, hitting {{convert|162|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at Daytona and {{convert|138|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Indianapolis 500]] race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/other/prime_movers.htm |title = The Diesel engine and its development, A historical timeline |author = Martin Leduc}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[David Evans (automobile racer)|Dave Evans]] became the first driver to complete the [[Indianapolis 500]] without making a single [[pit stop]], completing the full distance on the lead lap and finishing 13th, relying on torque and fuel efficiency to overcome weight and low peak power.&lt;ref name = "roadking"&gt;{{cite web |title = Track Star, The diesel-powered Audi R10 owns every race it enters |author = Paul Abelson |publisher = Road King Magazine |url = http://www.roadking.com/story.php?id=800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, a 1925 [[Bentley]] with a [[L Gardner and Sons Ltd|Gardner]] 4LW engine was the first diesel-engine car to take part in the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] when it was driven by Lord Howard de Clifford. It was the leading British car and finished fifth overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Firsts in sport |url = http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202195321/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/m.gratton/Sport.htm |archivedate = 2008-12-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Cummins Diesel Roadster.jpg|thumb|A 1950 "Cummins Diesel Special" [[Indianapolis 500]] roadster.]]
In 1952, [[Fred Agabashian]] in a Cummins diesel won the pole at the Indianapolis 500 race with a turbocharged 6.6-liter diesel car,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cummins History |publisher = [[Cummins]] |url = http://www.cummins.com/eu/pages/en/whoweare/cumminshistory.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a record for pole position lap speed, {{convert|222.108|km/h|mi/h|3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "roadking"/&gt; [[Don Cummins]] and his chief engineer [[Neve Reiners]] recognized that the low [[center of gravity]] of the [[flat engine]] configuration (designed to lie beneath the floor of a [[bus]]) plus the power advantage gained by the novel use of [[Elliott Motor|Elliott]] [[turbocharger|turbocharging]] would be a winning combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Snowberger's Done It Again&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; 1952 Cummins Diesel Car |publisher = National Indy 500 Collector Club |author = Greg Littleton |url = http://www.ni500cc.com/chutes/win05d.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start, a slow pace lap (reportedly less than {{convert|150|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}) apparently induced what is now referred to as "[[turbo lag]]" and badly hampered the throttle response of the Cummins Diesel.  Although Agabashian found himself in eighth place before reaching the first turn, he moved up to fifth in a few laps and was running competitively (albeit well back in the field after a tire change) until the badly situated air intake of the car swallowed enough debris from the track to disable the turbocharger at lap 71; he finished 27th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Viva la diesel! |author = Gavin Foster |date=  2006-07-27 |publisher = [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Online |url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=278954&amp;area=/wheels_deals/new_reviews/}} (incorrect reference to the Cummins Diesel leading laps in the race)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s and rule makers supported the concept, [[BMW]] and [[Volkswagen]] raced diesel [[touring car racing|touring cars]], with BMW winning the 1998 [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] with a [[BMW E36|320d]] against other factory-entered diesel competition of VW and about 200 normally powered cars, mainly by being able to drive very long stints. [[Alfa Romeo]] even organized a racing series with their [[Alfa Romeo 147]] 1.9 JTD models.

In 2006, a BMW 120d repeated a similar result, scoring 5th in a field of 220 cars, many of them much more powerful, a significantly stronger competition than in 1998. The VW [[Dakar Rally]] race [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] for 2005 and 2006 are powered by their own line of TDI engines in order to challenge for the first overall diesel win there.

[[Image:R10 Engine.jpg|thumb|The diesel engine of [[Audi]]'s [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]]-winning [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].]]

Meanwhile, the five time [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]] race car was replaced by the [[Audi R10 TDI]] in 2006, which is powered by a {{convert|650|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1100|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}}  V12 TDI [[common rail]] diesel engine, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, instead of the 6 used in the R8, to handle the extra torque produced. The gearbox is considered the main problem, as earlier attempts by others failed due to the lack of suitable transmissions that could stand the torque long enough.

After winning the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 2006 with their diesel-powered [[Audi R20 TDI|R10 TDI]], [[Audi]] obtained the overall win at the 2006 [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], too. This is the first time a sports car could compete for overall victories with diesel fuel against cars powered with regular fuel or [[methanol]] and [[bio-ethanol]]. However, the significance of this is slightly lessened by the fact that the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]]/[[ALMS]] race rules encourage the use of alternative fuels such as diesel.

Audi again triumphed at Sebring in 2007. It had both a speed and fuel economy advantage over the entire field including the [[Porsche RS Spyder]]s, gasoline powered purpose-built race cars. Audi's diesels won again the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, against competition coming from the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]] diesel powered racer.

In 2006, the [[JCB Dieselmax]] broke the diesel land speed record posting an average speed of over {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  The vehicle used "two diesel engines that have a combined total of 1,500 horsepower (1120 kilowatts). Each is a 4-cylinder, 4.4-liter engine used commercially in a backhoe loader." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New diesel land speed record: {{convert|328|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} |author = Associated Press |publisher = MSNBC |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14486354/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = JCB car beats diesel speed record |date=  2006-08-22 |publisher = BBC |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/5273540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]], Jason Plato and Darren Turner are racing factory sponsored SEAT Leon TDI with some success against a variety of gasoline powered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seatsportuk.co.uk/sport/ |title=SEAT Sport UK |publisher=SEAT Sport UK |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Zemp''' (born 14 May 1937, [[Basle]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss-French [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Hugo+Zemp Hugo Zemp Biography - Discogs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnocenter"&gt;[http://ethnocenter.org/ZempTalk The Center for Ethnomusicology at Columbia University: A Conversation With Hugo Zemp]&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific recorder of ethnic music and a writer on the subject, he has also shot a number of films about music of various regions, including 1988 film ''Voix de tête, voix de poitrine'' and 2002 film ''An African Brass Band'' filmed by him in [[Ivory Coast]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="ethnocenter"/&gt; His wide musical expertise includes music notably in Africa, Oceania and Switzerland. He also had particular interest in yodeling and lullabies. His recordings  of lullabies from Solomon Islands were later released by [[UNESCO]] as part of their ''[[Musical Sources]]'' collection. One famous lullaby he recorded, a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called "Rorogwela" was sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita old woman. The recording was later used, apparently without permission, in [[Deep Forest]]'s song "[[Sweet Lullaby]]".

Prof. Zemp studied [[musicology]] and [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Basle]] graduating in 1961. He also finished a diploma in percussion at the [[City of Basel Music Academy]] (Basel's Conservatory school) in 1960. He attended [[École pratique des hautes études]] for his doctorate.

He joined [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] ([[CNRS]]) becoming a director of research. He taught [[ethnomusicology]] at the [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|University of Paris X-Nanterre]]. In 1982, he became editor the recording series  (''Collection du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et du Musée de l'Homme''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/label/Collection+du+Centre+National+de+la+Recherche+Scientifique+et+du+Mus%C3%A9e+de+l%27Homme Discogs.com: ''Collection du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et du Musée de l'Homme'']&lt;/ref&gt; on the ''Le Chant du Monde'' record label. In tens of productions by Zemp, it included music from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ivory Coast, Romania, Solomon Islands and various countries in Central Africa. There were also a number of recordings of [[yodeling]] from Switzerland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38574">'''Inquiry-based learning''' (also '''enquiry-based learning''' in [[British English]])&lt;ref&gt;The UK dictionaries Collins and Longman list the spelling "inquiry" first, and Oxford simply calls it another spelling, without labeling it as US English.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[active learning]] that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios—rather than simply presenting established facts or portraying a smooth path to knowledge. The process is often assisted by a [[facilitator]]. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning includes [[problem-based learning]], and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceebl.manchester.ac.uk/ebl/ What is Inquiry Based Learning (EBL)?] Centre for Excellence in Enquiry-Based Learning. University of Manchester. Retrieved October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry-based instruction is principally very closely related to the development and practice of thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Dostál, J. (2015). [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkb3MwMDN8Z3g6MmU4MzM5YzA1YzcyNzM4 Inquiry-based instruction : Concept, essence, importance and contribution.] Olomouc: Palacký University, {{ISBN|978-80-244-4507-6}}, doi 10.5507/pdf.15.24445076&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Inquiry-based learning is primarily a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] method, developed during the [[discovery learning]] movement of the 1960s as a response to traditional forms of instruction—where people were required to memorize information from instructional materials,&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. S. (1961). "The act of discovery". Harvard Educational Review 31 (1): 21–32.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[direct instruction]] and [[rote learning]].  The philosophy of inquiry based learning finds its antecedents in [[constructivist learning]] theories, such as the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], and [[Paulo Freire|Freire]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J (1997) How We Think, New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (1984) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, New York: Continuum Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L.S. (1962) Thought and Language, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered a constructivist philosophy. Generating information and making meaning of it based on personal or societal experience is referred to as constructivism.&lt;ref name="journals2.scholarsportal.info"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachtold|first1=Manuel|title=What do students "construct" according to constructivism in science education?|journal=Research in Science Education|date=2013|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2477–96|doi=10.1007/s11165-013-93697|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11|bibcode=2013RScEd..43.2477B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey's experiential learning pedagogy (that is, learning through experiences) comprises the learner actively participating in personal or authentic experiences to make meaning from it.&lt;ref name="Toward a theory of experience"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Wolff-Michael|last2=Jornet|first2=Alfredo|title=Toward a theory of experience|journal=Science Education|date=2013|volume=98|issue=1|pages=106–26|doi=10.1002/sce.21085|bibcode=2014SciEd..98..106R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twigg|first1=Vani Veikoso|title=Teachers' practices, values and beliefs for successful inquiry-based teaching in the International Baccalaureate Primary years Programme|journal=Journal of Research in International Education|date=2010|volume=9|issue=1|pages=40–65|doi=10.1177/1475240909356947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inquiry can be conducted through experiential learning because inquiry values the same concepts, which include engaging with the content/material in questioning, as well as investigating and collaborating to make meaning. Vygotsky approached constructivism as learning from an experience that is influenced by society and the facilitator. The meaning constructed from an experience can be concluded as an individual or within a group.&lt;ref name="journals2.scholarsportal.info"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toward a theory of experience"/&gt;

In the 1960s Joseph Schwab called for inquiry to be divided into three distinct levels.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, J. (1960) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1083585 Inquiry, the Science Teacher, and the Educator]. The School Review © 1960 The University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This was later formalized by Marshall Herron in 1971, who developed the Herron Scale to evaluate the amount of inquiry within a particular lab exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Herron, M.D. (1971). The nature of scientific enquiry. The school review, 79(2), 171–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there have been a number of revisions proposed and inquiry can take various forms. There is a spectrum of inquiry-based teaching methods available.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, J. G., &amp; Wilhelm, P. J. (2010). Inquiring minds learn to read, write, and think: Reaching all learners through inquiry. Middle School Journal, May 2010, 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Specific learning processes that people engage in during inquiry-learning include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = T. | last2 = Urhahne | first2 = D. | last3 = Schanze | first3 = S. | last4 = Ploetzner | first4 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Collaborative inquiry learning: Models, tools, and challenges | url = http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/21303| journal = International Journal of Science Education | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 349–377 | bibcode = 2010IJSEd..32..349B | doi = 10.1080/09500690802582241 | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Creating questions of their own
*Obtaining supporting evidence to answer the question(s)
*Explaining the evidence collected
*Connecting the explanation to the knowledge obtained from the investigative process
*Creating an argument and justification for the explanation

Inquiry learning involves developing questions, making observations, doing research to find out what information is already recorded, developing methods for experiments, developing instruments for data collection, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, outlining possible explanations and creating predictions for future study.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt;

=== Levels ===

There are many different explanations for inquiry teaching and learning and the various levels of inquiry that can exist within those contexts. The article titled ''The Many Levels of Inquiry'' by Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008)&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"/&gt; clearly outlines four levels of inquiry.

'''Level 1''': Confirmation Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.

'''Level 2''': Structured Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.

'''Level 3''': Guided Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.

'''Level 4''': Open/True Inquiry&lt;br /&gt;
Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions.

Banchi and Bell (2008) explain that teachers should begin their inquiry instruction at the lower levels and work their way to open inquiry in order to effectively develop students' inquiry skills. Open inquiry activities are only successful if students are motivated by intrinsic interests and if they are equipped with the skills to conduct their own research study.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, H., Joung, Y. J., Kim, M. (2012). The challenges of science inquiry teaching for pre-service teachers in elementary classrooms: Difficulties on and under the scene. Research in Science &amp; Technological Education, 42(3), 589–608.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open/true inquiry learning ===

An important aspect of inquiry-based learning (and science) is the use of open learning, as evidence suggests that only utilizing lower level inquiry is not enough to develop critical and scientific thinking to the full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berg | first1 = C A R | last2 = Bergendahl | first2 = V C B | last3 = Lundberg | first3 = B K S | last4 = Tibell | first4 = L A E | year = 2003 | title = Benefiting from an open-ended experiment?

There is an emphasis on the individual manipulating information and creating meaning from a set of given materials or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hannafin, M., Land, S., Oliver, K. (1999). Open learning environments: Foundation, methods, and models. In C. M. Reigeluth (Ed.), Instructional-design theories and models. A new paradigm of instructional theory Volume II (pp. 115–140). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In many conventional and structured learning environments, people are told what the outcome is expected to be, and then they are simply expected to 'confirm' or show evidence that this is the case.

Open learning has many benefits.&lt;ref name="Zion, M. 2007"/&gt; It means students do not simply perform experiments in a routine like fashion, but actually think about the results they collect and what they mean. With traditional non-open lessons there is a tendency for students to say that the experiment 'went wrong' when they collect results contrary to what they are told to expect. In open learning there are no wrong results, and students have to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the results they collect themselves and decide their value.

Open learning has been developed by a number of science educators including the American [[John Dewey]] and the German [[Martin Wagenschein]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Wagenschein's ideas particularly complement both open learning and inquiry-based learning in teaching work. He emphasized that students should not be taught bald facts, but should understand and explain what they are learning. His most famous example of this was when he asked physics students to tell him what the speed of a falling object was. Nearly all students would produce an equation, but no students could explain what this equation meant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Wagenschien used this example to show the importance of understanding over knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ed.fnal.gov/trc_new/sciencelines_online/fall97/activity_inserts.html |title= The Science Journal: Writing and Inquiry Development|publisher= |accessdate=2017-01-03|author=Dahl, Susan | author2=Franzen, Pat }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquisitive learning ===
Sociologist of education [[Phillip Brown (sociologist)|Phillip Brown]] defined '''inquisitive learning''' as learning that is [[Intrinsic motivation|intrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by curiosity and interest in knowledge for its own sake), as opposed to ''acquisitive learning'' that is [[Extrinsic motivation|extrinsically motivated]] (e.g. by acquiring high scores on examinations to earn credentials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Brown (sociologist) |date=March 2003 |title=The opportunity trap: education and employment in a global economy |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=141–179 |doi=10.2304/eerj.2003.2.1.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiwne |first1=Elinor Edvardsson |last2=Alves |first2=Mariana Gaio |date=March 2010 |title=Higher education and employability of graduates: will Bologna make a difference? |journal=European Educational Research Journal |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 [33] |doi=10.2304/eerj.2010.9.1.32|citeseerx=10.1.1.1013.4278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nielsen |first=Gritt B. |date=2015 |title=Figuration work: student participation, democracy and university reform in a global knowledge economy |series=EASA series |volume=27 |location=New York |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781782387718 |oclc=896861729 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=I9TtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, occasionally the term ''inquisitive learning'' is simply used as a synonym for ''inquiry-based learning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graseck |first=Paul |date=January 2005 |title=Where's the ministry in administration?: attending to the souls of our schools |journal=Phi Delta Kappan |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=373–378 |doi=10.1177/003172170508600508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Jeff C. |last2=Smart |first2=Julie |last3=Alston |first3=Daniel M. |date=October 2016 |title=Development and validation of Teacher Intentionality of Practice Scale (TIPS): a measure to evaluate and scaffold teacher effectiveness |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2016.05.007|bibcode=2003TeTeE..19..309T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiry-based science education ==

=== History of science education ===

Inquiry learning has been used as a teaching and learning tool for thousands of years, however, the use of inquiry within public education has a much briefer history.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"&gt;National Research Council. 2000. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards: A Guide for Teaching and Learning. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek and Roman [[educational philosophies]] focused much more on the art of agricultural and domestic skills for the middle class and [[Rhetoric|oratory]] for the wealthy upper class. It was not until the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason, during the late 17th and 18th century that the subject of Science was considered a respectable academic body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, M. (2006). The History and Philosophy of Education: Voices of Educational Pioneers Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0130955507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the 1900s the study of science within education had a primary focus on memorizing and organizing facts.

John Dewey, a well-known philosopher of education at the beginning of the 20th century, was the first to criticize the fact that [[science education]] was not taught in a way to develop young scientific thinkers. Dewey proposed that science should be taught as a process and way of thinking – not as a subject with facts to be memorized.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2000"/&gt; While Dewey was the first to draw attention to this issue, much of the reform within science education followed the lifelong work and efforts of Joseph Schwab. 
Joseph Schwab was an educator who proposed that science did not need to be a process for identifying stable truths about the world that we live in, but rather science could be a flexible and multi-directional inquiry driven process of thinking and learning. 
Schwab believed that science in the classroom should more closely reflect the work of practicing scientists. Schwab developed three levels of open inquiry that align with the breakdown of inquiry processes that we see today.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"&gt;Schwab, J. 1966. The Teaching of Science. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

#Students are provided with questions, methods and materials and are challenged to discover relationships between variables
#Students are provided with a question, however, the method for research is up to the students to develop
#Phenomena are proposed but students must develop their own questions and method for research to discover relationships among variables

Today, we know that students at all levels of education can successfully experience and develop deeper level thinking skills through scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"&gt;National Science Education Standards. (1996). National Academy Press. Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The graduated levels of scientific inquiry outlined by Schwab demonstrate that students need to develop thinking skills and strategies prior to being exposed to higher levels of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Schwab, J 1966"/&gt; Effectively, these skills need to be scaffolded by the teacher or instructor until students are able to develop questions, methods, and conclusions on their own.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008"&gt;Ban chi, H., &amp; Bell, R. (2008). The Many Levels of Inquiry. Science and Children, 46(2), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A catalyst for reform within North American science education was the 1957 launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the Soviet Union satellite. This historical scientific breakthrough caused a great deal of concern around the science and technology education the American students were receiving. In 1958 the U.S. congress developed and passed the National Defense Education Act in order to provide math and science teachers with adequate teaching materials.&lt;ref name="science.education.nih.gov"&gt;National Institute for Health. (2005). Doing Science: The Process of Science Inquiry. http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih6/inquiry/guide/info_process-a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

America's National Science Education Standards (NSES) (1996)&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; outlines six important aspects pivotal to inquiry learning in [[science education]].

#Students should be able to recognize that science is more than [[memorizing]] and knowing facts.
#Students should have the opportunity to develop new knowledge that builds on their prior knowledge and scientific ideas.
#Students will develop new knowledge by restructuring their previous understandings of scientific concepts and adding new information learned.
#Learning is influenced by students' social environment whereby they have an opportunity to learn from each other.
#Students will take control of their learning.
#The extent to which students are able to learn with deep understanding will influence how transferable their new knowledge is to real life contexts.

== In other disciplines/programs ==

Science naturally lends itself to investigation and collection of data, but it is applicable in other subject areas where people are developing critical thinking and investigation skills.  In [[history]], for example, Robert Bain in his article in ''[[How Students Learn]]'', describes how to "problematize" history.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, R.B., Donovan, M.S. &amp; Bransford, J.D. (Eds). (2005). "They thought the world was flat?": Applying the principles of How People Learn in teaching high school history. How Students Learn. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press. http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309074339&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's idea is to first organize a learning curriculum around central concepts. Next, people studying the curriculum are given a question and primary sources such as eye witness historical accounts, and the task for inquiry is to create an interpretation of history that will answer the central question.  It is held that through the inquiry people will develop skills and factual knowledge that supports their answers to a question. They will form an hypothesis, collect and consider information and revisit their hypothesis as they evaluate their data.

=== Ontario's kindergarten program ===

After Charles Pascal's report in 2009, the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]'s Ministry of Education decided to implement a full day kindergarten program that focuses on inquiry and play-based learning, called The Early Learning Kindergarten Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pascal|first1=Charles|title=With Our Best Future in Mind|url=http://ywcacanada.ca/data/research_docs/00000001.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2014, all primary schools in Ontario started the program. The curriculum document&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt; outlines the philosophy, definitions, process and core learning concepts for the program. Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Piaget's child development theory and Dewey's experiential learning are the heart of the program's design. As research shows, children learn best through play, whether it is independently or in a group. Three forms of play are noted in the curriculum document, pretend or "pretense" play, socio-dramatic play and constructive play. Through play and authentic experiences, children interact with their environment (people and/or objects) and question things; thus leading to inquiry learning. A chart on page 15 clearly outlines the process of inquiry for young children, including initial engagement, exploration, investigation, and communication.&lt;ref name="MoE"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Education|title=Early Learning Kindergarten Program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/kindergarten_english_june3.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new program supports holistic approach to learning. For further details, please see the curriculum document.&lt;ref name="MoE"/&gt;

Since the program is extremely new, there is limited research on its success and areas of improvement. One government research report was released with the initial groups of children in the new kindergarten program. The Final Report: Evaluation of the Implementation of the Ontario Full-Day Early-Learning Kindergarten Program from Vanderlee, Youmans, Peters, and Eastabrook (2012) conclude with primary research that high-need children improved more compared to children who did not attend Ontario's new kindergarten program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanderlee|first1=Mary-Louise|last2=Youmans|first2=S|last3=Peters|first3=R|last4=Eastabrook|first4=J|title=Final report: Evaluation of the implementation of the Ontario full-day early-learning kindergarten program|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/FDELK_ReportFall2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with inquiry-based learning in all divisions and subject areas, longitudinal research is needed to examine the full extent of this teaching/learning method.

== Misconceptions about inquiry ==

There are several common misconceptions regarding inquiry-based science, the first being that inquiry science is simply instruction that teaches students to follow the scientific method. Many teachers had the opportunity to work within the constraints of the scientific method as students themselves and figure inquiry learning must be the same. Inquiry science is not just about solving problems in six simple steps but much more broadly focused on the intellectual problem-solving skills developed throughout a scientific process.&lt;ref name="National Science Education Standards 1996"/&gt; Additionally, not every hands-on lesson can be considered inquiry.

Some educators believe that there is only one true method of inquiry, which would be described as the level four: Open Inquiry. While open inquiry may be the most authentic form of inquiry, there are many skills and a level of conceptual understanding that the students must have developed before they can be successful at this high level of inquiry.&lt;ref name="Ban chi, H. 2008" /&gt; While inquiry-based science is considered to be a teaching strategy that fosters higher order thinking in students, it should be one of several methods used. A multifaceted approach to science keeps students engaged and learning.

Not every student is going to learn the same amount from an inquiry lesson; students must be invested in the topic of study to authentically reach the set learning goals. Teachers must be prepared to ask students questions to probe their thinking processes in order to assess accurately. Inquiry-science requires a lot of time, effort, and expertise, however, the benefits outweigh the cost when true authentic learning can take place{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

== Neuroscience complexity ==

The literature states that inquiry requires multiple cognitive processes and variables, such as causality and co-occurrence that enrich with age and experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Black|first2=J|last3=Keselman|first3=A|last4=Kaplan|first4=D|title=The development of cognitive skills to support inquiry learning|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2000|volume=18|issue=4|pages=495–523|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1804_3|citeseerx=10.1.1.527.1718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=D|last2=Pease|first2=M|title=What needs to develop in the development of inquiry skills?|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=2008|volume=26|issue=4|pages=512–59|doi=10.1080/07370000802391745}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kuhn, et al. (2000) used explicit training workshops to teach children in grades six to eight in the United States how to inquire through a quantitative study. By completing an inquiry-based task at the end of the study, the participants demonstrated enhanced mental models by applying different inquiry strategies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In a similar study, Kuhan and Pease (2008) completed a longitudinal quantitative study following a set of American children from grades four to six to investigate the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies for inquiry. Results demonstrated that children benefitted from the scaffolding because they outperformed the grade seven control group on an inquiry task.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Understanding the neuroscience of inquiry learning the scaffolding process related to it should be reinforced for Ontario's primary teachers as part of their training.

== Notes for educators ==

Inquiry-based learning is fundamental for the development of higher order thinking skills. According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D. R. (2002). A revision of Bloom's Taxonomy: An overview. Theory Into Practice, 41(4), 212–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should be encouraging divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills that they will be able to transfer to other subjects.

As shown in the section above on the neuroscience of inquiry learning, it is significant to scaffold students to teach them how to inquire and inquire through the four levels. It cannot be assumed that they know how to inquire without foundational skills. Scaffolding the students at a younger age will result in enriched inquiring learning later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Inquiry-based learning can be done in multiple formats, including:

* Field-work
* Case studies
* Investigations
* Individual and group projects
* Research projects

* Encourage students to demonstrate learning [https://.yifindia.com using a range of media]

=== Necessity for teacher training ===

There is a necessity for professional collaboration when executing a new inquiry program (Chu, 2009; Twigg, 2010). The teacher training and process of using inquiry learning should be a joint mission to ensure the maximal amount of resources are used and that the teachers are producing the best learning scenarios. The scholarly literature supports this notion. Twigg's (2010) education professionals who participated in her experiment 
emphasized year round professional development sessions, such as workshops, weekly meetings and observations, to ensure inquiry is being implemented in the class correctly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another example is Chu's (2009) study, where the participants appreciated the professional collaboration of educators, information technicians and librarians to provide more resources and expertise for preparing the structure and resources for the inquiry project.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=K.W.S|title=Inquiry project-based learning with a partnership of three types of teachers and the school librarian|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2009|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1671–86|doi=10.1002/asi.21084}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish a professional collaboration and researched training methods, administration support is required for funding.

Nonetheless the constructivist movement gained great momentum in the 1990s, because many educators began to write about this philosophy of learning.

Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, &amp; Chinn cite several studies supporting the success of the constructivist [[Problem-based learning|problem-based]] and inquiry learning methods. For example, they describe a project called GenScope, an inquiry-based science software application. Students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.&lt;ref name="hmelo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hmelo-Silver | last2 = Duncan | last3 = Chinn | year = 2007 | title = Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) | url = http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/hmelo_ep07.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Educational Psychologist | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 99–107 | doi=10.1080/00461520701263368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Hmelo-Silver et al. also cite a large study by Geier on the effectiveness of inquiry-based science for middle school students, as demonstrated by their performance on high-stakes standardized tests. The improvement was 14% for the first cohort of students and 13% for the second cohort. This study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.&lt;ref name="hmelo" /&gt;

In a 2006 article, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute's president, Chester E. Finn Jr., was quoted as saying "But like so many things in education, it gets carried to excess... [the approach is] fine to some degree.".&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Thomson | first = Robert | date = 2006-01-19 |title = What's the Right Formula? | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113763977423350560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization ran a study in 2005 concluding that the emphasis states put on inquiry-based learning is too great.&lt;ref name="fordham"&gt;{{cite report | last = Gross | first = Paul | date = December 2005| title = The State of State Science Standards | url= http://edex.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/publication/pdfs/Science%20Standards.FinalFinal_8.pdf | publisher = Thomas B. Fordham Institute | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard E. Mayer from the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2004 that there was sufficient research evidence to make any reasonable person skeptical about the benefits of discovery learning—practiced under the guise of cognitive constructivism or social constructivism—as a preferred instructional method. He reviewed research on discovery of problem-solving rules culminating in the 1960s, discovery of conservation strategies culminating in the 1970s, and discovery of LOGO programming strategies culminating in the 1980s. In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Should there be a three-strikes rule against pure discovery learning?

It should be cautioned that inquiry-based learning takes a lot of planning before implementation.  It is not something that can be put into place in the classroom quickly.  Measurements must be put in place for how students knowledge and performance will be measured and how standards will be incorporated.  The teacher's responsibility during inquiry exercises is to support and facilitate student learning (Bell et al., 769–770).  A common mistake teachers make is lacking the vision to see where students' weaknesses lie.  According to Bain, teachers cannot assume that students will hold the same assumptions and thinking processes as a professional within that discipline (p.&amp;nbsp;201).

While some see inquiry-based teaching as increasingly mainstream, it can be perceived as in conflict with [[standardized testing]] common in [[standards-based assessment]] systems which emphasise the measurement of student knowledge, and meeting of pre-defined criteria, for example the shift towards "fact" in changes to the National Assessment of Educational Progress as a result of the American [[No Child Left Behind]] program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Programs such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Program can be criticized for their claims to be an inquiry based learning program.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} While there are different types of inquiry (as stated above) the rigid structure of this style of inquiry based learning program almost completely rules out any real inquiry based learning in the lower grades. Each "unit of inquiry" is given to the students, structured to guide them and does not allow students to choose the path or topic of their inquiry. Each unit is carefully planned to connect to the topics the students are required to be learning in school and does not leave room for open inquiry in topics that the students pick. Some may feel that until the inquiry learning process is open inquiry then it is not true inquiry based learning at all. Instead of opportunities to learn through open and student-led inquiry, the IB program is viewed by some to simply be an extra set of learning requirements for the students to complete.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Additional scholarly research literature ==

Chu (2009) used a mixed method design to examine the outcome of an inquiry project completed by students in Hong Kong with the assistance of multiple educators. Chu's (2009) results show that the children were more motivated and academically successful compared to the control group.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1671"/&gt;

'''''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong''''' is a 1995 book by [[James W. Loewen]], a  sociologist. It critically examines twelve popular American [[high school]] history textbooks and concludes that the textbook authors propagate false, [[Eurocentric]] and [[mythology|mythologized]] views of [[History of the United States|American history]]. In addition to his critique of the dominant historical themes presented in high school textbooks, Loewen presents themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A revised hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008.

==Themes==
In ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'',  Loewen criticizes modern American high school history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people  and events such as [[Christopher Columbus]], the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their "bland" and simplistic style. He proposes that when [[History of the United States|American history]] textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of [[hero]]es, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James. [http://www.ushistory.org/us/historians/loewen.asp Interview by ushistory.org]. 12 May 2000. Web. 21 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35759">'''List of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros publications''' is a collection of exhibition catalogs, scholarly works, and ebooks focused on Latin American art published by [[Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] (CPPC), a privately held Latin American art collection organization founded by [[Patricia Phelps de Cisneros]] and [[Gustavo Cisneros]] based in [[Venezuela]] and [[New York City]].

== History ==
Since the 1990s, the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros was created with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated both on a regional and international level. As part of its four-pronged approach, CPPC lends artworks often in traveling exhibitions held at major institutional partners with accompanying exhibition catalogs that include essays, manifestos, and bibliographic profiles.&lt;ref name=LATimes-NomadicPhaseEnding-2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kraul|first1=Chris|title=Cisneros art trove ends its nomadic phase|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/01/cisneros-art-tr.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPPC works with scholars and academics to learn more about the artists and their works, and has established a prolific publications program to provide supporting information about the artists and their work, in addition to building an online forum for the artwork.&lt;ref name=ColeccionCisneros-Ch1-Video-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 1: Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, A Passion for Latin America|url=http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/content/chapter-1-patricia-phelps-de-cisneros-passion-latin-america|website=Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros|format=Video|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The publication program of Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros that is represented here is unique in its international and pan-regional scope. Works are typically published in multiple languages, often within the same publication. The publications are oftentimes the first time the collection and curation of information about certain artists and regional and national art movements are published. Contributors are established art historians, curators, and often the artists who are working within or are part of the art movements themselves. Art movement manifestos are published in their entirety, often with full translations, in accessible and/or digital format, sometimes for the first time.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes-RadicalGeometry-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Gareth|title=Patricia Phelps de Cisneros: an art patron on a mission|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e06f9776-719a-11e4-b178-00144feabdc0|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MoMADonation-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=102 Latin American Artworks, and a New Institute, Will Go to MoMA|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/arts/design/102-latin-american-artworks-and-a-new-institute-will-go-to-moma.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maritime security operations''' ('''MSO''') are the actions of modern [[Navy|naval forces]] to "combat sea–based [[terrorism]] and other illegal activities, such as hijacking, [[piracy]], and [[slavery]], also known as [[human trafficking]]."&lt;ref name="MARITIME-SECURITY-OPERATIONS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/about/navylife/onduty/navyglobalinvolvement/maritime/|title=Maritime Security Operations|publisher=[[US Navy]]|accessdate=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships assigned to such operations may also assist seafaring vessels in distress. These activities are part of an overall category of activities which fall short of open warfare called [[military operations other than war]] (MOOTW).MSO also involve the marine environmental protection, creating a safer and clean environment.

Their mission is to create a safer and reliable international ocean transportation system, to protect the public from any unfair and deceiving practice.

A primary component of MSO requires inspections and, at times, forced [[Boarding (attack)|boardings]] of vessels at sea. These actions are called [[visit, board, search, and seizure]] (VBSS). Also arrests and VBSS of ships which may have been sighted (via lookouts) from a distance to be underway and not responding to communications made to her or may have some form of smaller attached crafts which may be seen to be used as other means to attack larger crafts.

==Who==

There are two major naval forces that conduct such operations; the United States Coast Guard and the United States Navy. Although they both have very distinct jobs from one another, one of their major jobs is to be able to provide security operations.

The U.S Coast Guard is a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]], they have eleven official missions. Their role is to provide port &amp; waterway security, drug interdiction, search and rescue, marine environment protection, [[ICE operations]], aids to navigation, living marine recourses, marine safety, defense readiness, law enforcement and migrant interdiction along with several other missions. Overall, their role is to provide a safer maritime industry.

Along with the U.S Coast Guard, the U.S Navy is also another branch if the Unites Stated Armed forces. Unlike the Coast Guard, the Navy is a projection of force in areas beyond the U.S shores. Their operations go beyond the shores; they provide aid to military out on the sea, carry troops to other countries, strategic plans for attacks and protect the sea lanes.

==Operations==
Today's modern naval force have been able to detect, strategize, and prevent dozens of several illegal activities. Piracy, being one of the must known crime in the maritime industry has not been able to control its activities. Piracy was known to have a great presence during the early 1500s, up to this day the number of piracy activity is still significantly large. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the number of piracy attack have been found to be cyclical in nature, taking its high points in 2003 and 2010. In spite of this high point, several organization against anti-piracy such as the [[Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)&lt;ref&gt;Counter-piracy operations (Archived). (2016, December 19). Retrieved April 9, 2017, from http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48815.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  have been able to disrupt pirates attacks protecting vessel and their crew member along with their cargo.  As a safety measure, the U.S Coast Guard encourage the ships' captain to know his crew, deliver a detailed plan of his sea trip to a trusted friend, final check before departing, notify Coast Guard of any suspicious activity, and finally consider clearing local customs before departing on a foreign cruise. Taking these protective measures will lessen the possibility of piracy or high jacking.&lt;ref&gt;Nincic, D. J. (2013, October 1). Maritime Security: Current Threats and Implications. Retrieved April 9, 2017, from http://www.pacmar.com/story/2013/10/01/features/maritime-security:-current-threats-and-implications/184.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant amount of contraband such as drugs has entered many ports through vessels claiming to be caring different types of cargo. Drug Interdiction is one of the eleven Coast Guard official missions, they aim to prevent drug traffic by intersecting drug carrying vessels out at sea. Mariners aboard a vessel that have information that a ship is involved in narcotics trafficking are required to contact their nearest Coast Guard unit. Several cargo ships have been contained with thousands of kilos on board. In the mid-year of 2015, the {{USS|Gary|FFG 51}} marked its tenth successful interdiction since October 2014. Joining forces with the U.S Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy they contained 11,700 kilograms of cocaine off the coast of Central America. While conducting a regular patrol the USS Gary tailed and located a small coastal freighter. After observing the crew discarding suspicious contraband overboard Gary launched a small boat to recover the suspected contraband.&lt;ref&gt;Singer	USS ''GARY'' (FFG 51) Public Affairs Officer, %. %.

Slavery also known as human trafficking in modern days is the act of forcing some type of labor or sexual act upon someone. As the years go by the number of men, women, and children being trafficking are significantly large, this is happening around the world including the United States. Human trafficking comes second to drug trafficking generating billions of dollars per year. This crime is hard to follow up due to the victim's language and fear to the traffickers and law enforcement. The [[Department of the Navy]] (DoN) and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) along with other offices have come together to fight and ensure that the Combating Trafficking in the Persons (CTIP) policies are properly implemented and integrated. In the month of January 2017, the SDPD was able to arrest 38 men involved with human trafficking during an undercover operation. Even though the Coast Guard and the Navy were not involved in this operation, they also have operations similar to drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Human Trafficking. (2017, March 22).

Retrieved April 9, 2017, from https://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/&lt;/ref&gt;

Search and rescue missions is also considered a maritime security operation, it is one of the oldest Coast Guard missions. As the leader in the field of search and rescue missions, worldwide, to do so the coast guard keeps facilities on the East, West, and Gulf coasts. When a [[search and rescue]](SAR) mission is being conducted, it involves cutter, aircraft, and boats. Their goal is to minimize the loss of life and injuries, to provide aid to those in need of it. Using the coordinates of the vessel in need gives the Coast Guard and an idea of where to look for. These coordinates are given by a device called a "Black Box".&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue (CG-SAR). (2016, December 21). Retrieved April 9, 2017, from https://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such operations is the involvement of the multinational coalition [[Combined Task Force 150]], which performs Maritime Security Operations in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Persian Gulf]]. During the [[Somali Civil War]], they provided anti-piracy operations along the coast of [[Somalia]] in international waters. During the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|2006–2007 war]], they performed a cordon along the coast to prevent the escape of [[Al-Qaeda]] operatives by sea.&lt;!-- ==See also== --&gt;

'''Medstar Television Inc.''' is a television production company based in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

==History &amp; Founding==
Medstar was incorporated in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1981 by Paul Dowling and William Ferretti to produce medical news and health information. &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Medstar financed, produced and distributed all of its own productions. ([http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters Health Matters: Independents Prescription Works])

==Productions==
One of its first was ''Health Matters'', a program on health and lifestyle issues, produced in cooperation with hospitals throughout the United States, which sponsor the program in their local areas with local and national content, along the same lines as ''[[PM Magazine]]''. ''Health Matters'' was [[television syndication|syndicated]] to various commercial and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations during the 1980s.  &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1987-01-18/business/2567668_1_medstar-communications-health-matters-television&lt;/ref&gt;

Medstar later expanded to produce two medical news products, "MedstarSource" and "MedstarAdvances" syndicated to commercial television stations in the United States.  Production of these segments ended in August 2011.

In 1990 Medstar began to produce programming for cable television including the [[Discovery Channel]], [[HBO]] and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]].

In 1995 the company created the ''Medical Detectives'' series on [[forensic science]], which premiered on TLC in April 1995. ([https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006447/ IMDB program listing])  It was the first reality based forensic series on television and used a 'murder mystery' approach to documentary storytelling. In 2000 the Medical Detectives series moved to the CourtTV network (now [[TruTV]]) where it was re-titled ''[[Forensic Files]]'' and quickly became the networks highest rated television series.  Internationally, the series was sold to stations and networks in over 142 countries where it remains enormously popular.  Peter Thomas narrates the series which is still in production, with more than 400 episodes. In 2002, ''Forensic Files'' would appear on [[NBC]] as the first prime time television series originally produced for cable to air on a commercial network, as a summer replacement series.

'''Military education and training''' is a process which intends to establish and improve the capabilities of [[armed forces|military personnel]] in their respective roles. It begins with [[recruit training]], proceeds to education and training specific to military roles, and may also include additional training during a military career. Military training may be voluntary or compulsory duty. 

== Recruit training ==
{{Main|Recruit training}}

The primary form of military training is [[recruit training]], which makes use of various conditioning techniques to [[Resocialization|resocialize]] trainees into the military system, ensure that they will obey all orders without hesitation, and teach basic military skills.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/publications/docs/LCIreport.pdf|title=Final report of the Learning Culture Inquiry|last=Australia, Department of Defence|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|date=2004|title=Misplaced Loyalties: The Role of Military Culture in the Breakdown of Discipline in Two Peace Operations|url=http://jmss.org/jmss/index.php/jmss/article/view/214|journal=Journal of Military and Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|issn=1488-559X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title='Joining the ranks: The role of indoctrination in transforming civilians to service members', (in 'Military life: The psychology of serving in peace and combat [vol. 2]')|last=McGurk et al.|first=|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=978-0275983024|location=Westport|pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427757599|title=On killing : the psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society|last=Dave.|first=Grossman,|date=2009|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|isbn=9780316040938|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=427757599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25283124|title=Squaddies : portrait of a subculture|last=John.|first=Hockey,|date=1986|publisher=University of Exeter|isbn=9780859892483|location=Exeter, Devon|oclc=25283124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[drill instructor]] has the task of making the service members fit for military use. [[Resocialization|(Resocialization]] is a [[Sociology|sociological]] concept referring to the process of mentally and emotionally "re-training" a person so they can operate in a new environment, and involves changes to an individual's attitudes and behaviours.)  

== Role-specific training ==
After their [[recruit training]], personnel may undergo further training specific to their military role, including the use of any specialist equipment. After this point, they are normally deemed fit for military service.

== Further training ==
Military personnel may continue to receive training during their career.

== Military academies ==
Larger countries may have [[Military academy|military academies]], which combine military training with formal qualifications.

The neurodiversity movement describes itself as an international [[civil rights movements|civil rights movement]], of which the [[autism rights movement]] is its most influential submovement. Citing the classic legal maxim, "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]", the movement promotes self-advocacy of its members. Neurodiversity advocates promote support systems (such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support)&lt;ref name="ASAN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/policy-advocacy/position-statements/|title=Position Statements|publisher=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow those who are "non-neurotypical" to live their lives as they are, rather than being coerced or forced to adopt what neurodiversity proponents see as uncritically accepted ideas of normality, or to conform to a clinical ideal.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neurodiversitysymposium.wordpress.com/what-is-neurodiversity/|title=What is Neurodiversity?|publisher=National Symposium on Neurodiversity at Syracuse University|year=2011|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodiversity frames [[autism spectrum|autism]], dyslexia, and other neurological conditions as natural human variations rather than pathologies or disorders, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) [[cure]]d, instead believing them to be authentic forms of human [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], self-expression, and being.

==Terminology==
According to the 2011 National Symposium on Neurodiversity held at [[Syracuse University]], neurodiversity is:

{{quote|... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"/&gt;}}

==Autism rights movement==
{{further|Autism rights movement}}
The [[autism rights movement]] (ARM) is a [[social movement]] within the neurodiversity movement that encourages autistic people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.] Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other views: the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the genes that cause autism; and the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

Many autistic supporters of autism rights describe themselves through words that emphasize the condition as an intrinsic part of their identity, such as "autistic", or "aspie" for those with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Ortega2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Francisco|title=The Cerebral Subject and the Challenge of Neurodiversity|journal=BioSocieties|date=December 2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=425–445|doi=10.1017/S1745855209990287|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/biosoc/journal/v4/n4/full/biosoc200938a.html|language=en|issn=1745-8552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts to a general recommendation by [[United States|US]] disability advocacy organizations{{who|date=July 2018}} for the use of [[person-first language]] when referring to a person with a medical or mental condition or disability, which emphasizes the ''person'' with the condition, who has, rather than is defined by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];

===Acceptance perspective===
Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.

The ''"acceptance perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work|publisher=Autistics.org|accessdate=2012-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215181832/http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|archivedate=2012-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such adheres to the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waltz, M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

===Advocacy===
According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature and "broaden[ing] the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

A 2009 study&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Edward|author2=Pollak, David|title=Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from the BRAINHE project.|journal=Dyslexia|date=January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–41|pmid=19140120|doi=10.1002/dys.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Griffin and David Pollak separated 27 students (with autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and stroke), into two categories of self-view: "a 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition". They found that although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals".&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

A 2013 online survey said this: "Such a deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit".&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece on June 30, 1997, Blume did not use the term "neurodiversity", but he did describe the foundation of the idea in the phrase "neurological pluralism":&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best."&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT/&gt;}}

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement, writing:&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;&lt;ref name="article"/&gt; also credit the earlier work of autistic advocate [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]], who was a principal early organizer of the international online autism community. Sinclair's 1993 speech, "Don't Mourn For Us",&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;Sinclair, Jim. [http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html Don't Mourn For Us.] Autism Network International, n.d..  Retrieved on 2013-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that some parents considered their child's autism diagnosis as "the most traumatic thing that ever happened to them". Sinclair (who did not speak until the age of 12) addressed the communal grief parents felt by asking them to try to take the perspectives of autistic people themselves:
{{quote|Non-autistic people see autism as a great tragedy, and parents experience continuing disappointment and grief at all stages of the child's and family's life cycle. But this grief does not stem from the child's autism in itself. It is grief over the loss of the normal child the parents had hoped and expected to have ... There's no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person—and if it were possible, the person you'd have left would not be the same person you started with. This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.&lt;ref name=Sinclair/&gt;}}

The term "neurodiversity" has since been applied to other conditions and has taken on a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger's syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ danda.org.uk]  DANDA website.

== Criticism ==
The concept of neurodiversity is controversial.&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; Those supporting the [[medical model of disability]] identify the mental differences associated with these conditions as disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions, intrinsic differences in functioning which cause impairments in many areas of life. From this point of view, the mental states that are encompassed by neurodiversity are medical conditions that can and should be treated.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009. "Neurodiversity in Higher Education." John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author David Pollak sees neurodiversity as an inclusive term for the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because they think it sounds too medical.&lt;ref name="Pollak" /&gt;

The concept of neurodiversity as applied to [[autism]] is criticized for being skewed towards the "high-functioning" individuals of the autistic spectrum or those with milder forms of the condition. Those with "low-functioning" autism are often significantly impaired in their everyday functioning, and may not be able to function effectively with even the extensive use of advanced [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]]. Because many of these low-functioning individuals are unable to communicate effectively to express their opinions and wishes, controversy surrounds the issue of who represents them and what represents their interests.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Michael|title=Why we should be cautious about celebrating autism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/why-we-shouldnt-celebrate-autism/17468#.VxzY_nBWY7k|website=www.spiked-online.com|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sue Rubin]], an autistic woman and author who was the subject of the documentary ''[[Autism is a World]]'', favors a cure for the condition and asserts that while those with high-functioning autism tend to support the neurodiversity anti-cure position, those who have low-functioning autism generally hold the opposite opinion.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Sue|title=Acceptance versus cure|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|website=www-cgi.cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=25 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926031713/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|archive-date=26 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis ... some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt;

Criticism has been levied against the "acceptance" position of neurodiversity advocates, with it being noted that even though the biomedical therapies that target the clinical features of, for example, autism and the conditions that may co-occur with it, do not amount to a complete cure, such treatments can still potentially significantly improve the everyday functioning and quality of life of those with these conditions. While such treatments require substantial investment and development and would not be available for application in the immediate future, they may provide greater benefit in the future and in the long-term.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick" /&gt; Many of those who view autism as a disabling developmental disease consider that the acceptance perspective of neurodiversity insults the suffering of its patients and their families.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;  Biology professor [[Jerry Coyne]] says that in its extreme, neurodiversity wishes to deny medical treatment for any person with a mental condition, particularly autism, even if the person wants a medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Coyne"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry |title=What do we do about “neurodiversity”? |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/what-do-we-do-about-neurodiversity/ |website=Why Evolution Is True |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who is a vocal opponent of the neurodiversity movement and an advocate for research for a cure for autism, criticizes the concept of neurodiversity for providing "simplistic solutions to hard problems" and trivializing the disabling aspects of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Mark|title=A different way of thinking|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/feature/different-way-thinking|website=News|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers his condition to have negatively affected his life, describing autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend.

The '''postage stamp problem''' is a [[mathematical]] riddle that asks what is the smallest postage value which cannot be placed on an envelope, if the latter can hold only a limited number of stamps, and these may only have certain specified face values.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;Jeffrey Shallit (2001), [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0112257 ''The computational complexity of the local postage stamp problem'']. SIGACT News 33 (1) (March 2002), 90-94.  Accessed on 2009-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose the envelope can hold only three stamps, and the available stamp values are 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, and 20 cents.  Then the solution is 13 cents; since any smaller value can be obtained with at most three stamps (e.g. 4 = 2 + 2, 8 = 5 + 2 + 1, etc.), but to get 13 cents one must use at least four stamps.

==Mathematical definition==
Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as follows: 
: Given an integer ''m'' and a set ''V'' of positive integers, find the smallest integer ''z'' that cannot be written as the sum ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ··· + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of some number ''k'' ≤ ''m'' of (not necessarily distinct) elements of ''V''.

==Complexity==
This problem can be solved by [[brute force search]] or [[backtracking]] with maximum time proportional to |''V'' |&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where |''V'' | is the number of distinct stamp values allowed.  Therefore, if the capacity of the envelope ''m'' is fixed, it is a [[polynomial time]] problem.  If the capacity ''m'' is arbitrary, the problem is known to be [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt;

'''Principles of [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]''' otherwise known as '''''Uṣūl al-[[fiqh]]''''' ({{lang-ar|أصول الفقه}})  is the study and critical analysis of the origins, sources, and principles upon which Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') is based.

Traditionally four main sources ([[Qur’an]], [[Sunnah]], consensus (''[[Ijma]]''), analogical reason (''[[Qiyas]]'')) are analysed along with a number of secondary sources and principles.  

The main subject areas of discussion are these:
* General evidences and principles (''adillah ijmalliya wa al-qawaid'')
* Resolution of conflict and discrepancy (''ta'deel wa tarjeeh'')
* Determination of rules and adoption/emulation of rules (''ijtihad wa taqlid'')
* Islamic Law (''hukm shari'')

==Etymology==
''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' comprises the conjunction of two Arabic terms, ''uṣūl'' and ''fiqh''. ''Uṣūl'' is derived from the root letters [[hamza]], [[sad (letter)|sad]] and [[lām]] which refers to basis. ''Fiqh'' linguistically refers to knowledge, deep understanding or comprehension.

Technically the term is used to refer to the body of evidences and principles that Islamic jurists utilize to provide solutions to problems.

==Definition of the Science of Uşūl al-Fiqh==
The science of uşūl al-fiqh is a science in which such rules whose results are placed in ways of deduction of juristic precepts are discussed. For instance, performing the prayers (şalāt) is mandatory in Islam, and this Qur’ānic verse proves that obligation: “And that perform the prayers” (6, 72). However, denotation of the verse is dependent upon the imperative, like “perform” in that verse, being apparent in the obligation on the one hand and Qur’ānic apparent meanings being authoritative on the other. Those two issues are dealt with in the science of uşūl al-fiqh. Now, when the jurist learns through this science that the imperative is apparent in the obligation and that the Qur’ānic apparent meanings are authoritative proofs, he can infer from the said verse that the prayers is mandatory.&lt;ref name="Hodaee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hodaee|first1=Alireza|title=An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence: A Shiite Approach|url=http://ijtihadnet.com/introduction-methodology-islamic-jurisprudence-shiite-approachpdf/|website=http://ijtihadnet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Aqidah}}
The [[Qur'an]] has always been regarded as the primary legal source of Islam, the speech of [[Allah]]. It has been transmitted through numerous chains (''mutawatir''). According to Roy Mottahedeh, "For over a thousand years the great majority of Muslim jurists agreed" that of the more than 6000 verses in the Qur'an, 500 have some legal content, most concerning [[ibadah]] (worship or religious ritual such as [[salat]] (prayer), [[hajj]] (pilgrimage), [[sawm]] (fasting), [[zakat]] (tithing)).   190 Qur'anic verses deal with some "aspects of the law" other than ibadah, but of these aspects "only matters of inheritance are laid out in any detail". &lt;ref name="Mottahedeh-intro-2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld Publications. |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Principles+of+Islamic+jurisprudence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwionOylkLPaAhWqz4MKHeGwC6oQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Principles%20of%20Islamic%20jurisprudence&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 April 2018 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For elaboration of the [[Quran]] or for clarification of a matter that is not mentioned in the Quran, these verses are supplemented by further revelation termed [[sunnah]]. Sunnah comprises explanations from Muhammad in terms of his speech, actions and silences which have been historically compiled and verified through chains of narrations called [[hadith]]s. Sunnah is second in prioritisation to Quran.

The Muslim [[jurists]] have found that some revelation has been captured through collective agreements expressed after the death of Muhammad through consensus of his companions which were transmitted over the ages. These are compiled as instances of consensus of the companions (''[[ijma al-sahaba]]'').

Therefore, the Qur’ān and the Sunnah are the two main sources of Islamic Legal Theory. However, the majority of jurists are of the view that Islamic law is based on four sources. 
* Ijmā‘ (consensus). It took the jurists considerable time to prove through the texts of the Qur’ān and the Sunnah that ijmā‘ is a valid source of law, and any that ḥukm (ruling) based on it should be accorded the status of the ḥukm of Allah . 
* Qiyās (analogy) was also successfully used to deduce the law from the Qur’ān and the Sunnah. The law deduced by Qiyās and ijmā‘ are actually dependent on evidence from the two main sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kayadibi |first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh) |date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|pages=94 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when these failed to provide the authority sought did jurists resort to interpretation ''[[ijtihad]]''.

In the very early days of Islam Muslim authorities tended to rely on their own opinions to establish their interpretation of what a prescribed law should be for any given situation not founded on the Qur'an, a practice known as ''[[ra'y]]''.

The jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]], however, preferred to rely solely on traditions from Muhammad and thereafter on the method known as ''[[qiyas]]'' ([[analogy]]) where interpretations were to be derived from comparisons with relative subjects dealt with in the Qur'an or the traditions.

It is now the scholarly consensus, amongst both orientalist and traditional scholarship, that the following is a myth: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Shafi'i's school of law was fully established together with the other schools founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Malik]], the "door" of ''ijtihad'' was closed and it was considered that ''ijma'' had been reached on all necessary points of law (though the schools differ in many matters to this day but mostly on minor points of interpretation). Accordingly, Islamic jurisprudence has changed little for centuries and is based fundamentally on the four sources mentioned above. There is much debate and critique as to whether closing the gates of ijtihad was acceptable and whether it contributed to the intellectual and civislisational decline of the Muslims."{{cn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wael Hallaq is widely credited for decisively discrediting this myth in the western world, whereas others such as Qasim Zaman continue to show how the Ulema continued to actively engage in Ijtihad. However, there is a valid debate over the degree to which the Ulema remained active in such endeavours ever since colonialism and modernity intruded Muslim lands. In fact, faced with such drastic change, there are certain cases that do show the Ulema to be initially dismissive of sociopolitical realities and hence lagging in their response- Nevertheless, eventually finding legal stratagems to solve dilemmas. A case in point is the issue of women's divorce in the time of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.&lt;ref&gt;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/60731/1/fareehak_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shi'a schools, they have continued with ''ijtihad'' to the present day. They however disputed the methodology of compilation of narrations of sunnah and also limited consensus of the companions to consensus of the family of Muhammad (''[[ijma]] [[ahl al-bayt]]'')

==Secondary sources==
*''Istihsan''
*''Masali Mursala''
*''Ihsaan'' (spiritual excellence, virtue)
*''Istidlaal''
*''Urf'' (local custom or pre-existing law)
*''Aql'' (reason or intellect)
*''Sadd al-dharai''
*''Shara man qablana''
*''Ijma al-ummah'' (consensus of the worldwide Muslim community)
*''Ijma khulafah al-rashideen'' (consensus of the first four caliphs)
*''Ijma ahl al-medina'' (consensus of the Muslims of Medina, as reflected in early hadith collections, ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'' the ''Muwatta'' of Imam Malik ibn Anas)
*''Ijma al-ullama'' (consensus of scholars of Islamic law)
*''Ijma ahl al-hali wa al-aqd''

==The schools of thought==

The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]] and parts of [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]])
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[northwest China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[Sudan]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]] and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists
*[[Awza'i]] No longer exists

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]])
*[[Zaydi]]

The schools of [[Khawarij]] comprise:
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

== Principles within Sunni Islam ==
{{fiqh}}
* That which is necessary to achieve an obligation is obligatory
* That which leads to haram is haram
* Lesser of the two evils
* The doubt does not remove the certainty

Islamic law within the Sunni understanding draws from numerous sources. The most basic two sources {{spaced ndash}} indeed, the defining characteristics of Sunni Islam {{spaced ndash}} are the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be the literal word of [[God in Islam|God]], and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]] including the statements and actions of [[Muhammad]] passed down through historically verifiable [[Hadith|reports]]. [[Ijma|consensus]] is also accepted by Sunni Muslims, though there is much differing over its exact definition. [[Qiyas|Analogical reason]] is typically referred to as a fourth primary source by later and modern Muslim authors, though its exact definition and even validity are not unchallenged.

Beyond the four main sources, other methods such as [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]], [[Istislah|public welfare]] and [[Urf|local custom]] are often considered, though discussions regarding how these sources are to be applied is ongoing.

===The contribution of al-Shafi'i===
[[Al-Shafi'i]] documented a systematized set of principles, developing a cohesive procedure for legal [[Ijtihad|derivation of verdicts]]. His approach contrasted with the [[Hanafite]] methodology that determined the sources from the sayings and rulings of the companions and successors.  Furthermore, he raised the [[Sunnah]] to a place of prominence and restricted its legal use.  According to Shafi'i, only practices directly passed down from [[Muhammad]] were valid, eliminating the legitimacy of practices of Muhammad's followers.  Prior to Shafi'i, legal reasoning included personal reasoning thus suffering from inconsistency.  Shafi'i is probably best known for writing [[Al-Risala (book)|Risala]], a prime example of applying logic and order to Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=166&amp;chapter=5 |title=Usul Al Fiqh After Al Imam Al Shafi'i| accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Risala is considered a seminal work in the field of principles, it has been noted that the term "usul" is neither found in the title of the book nor is it used as such within the text.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"&gt;Stewart, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of methods===
Between Shafi'i's Risala and the next attested works of usul is a gap of several hundred years. These later works were significantly different from Shafi'is book, likely due to the insertion of [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] and [[Ash'ari]]te theology into works of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=devin102&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Dawud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence." Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by [[Bernard G. Weiss]]. Pg. 102. [[Leiden]]: 2002. [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between Shafi'i's work and these later works {{spaced ndash}} in terms of both content and the large chronological gap between which they were all composed {{spaced ndash}} is so great that modern scholarship has questioned the status of Shafi'i as the founder of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wael Hallaq]], ''Was al-Shafi‘i the Master Architect of Islamic Jurisprudence?'', [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], 4 (November 1993), pg. 587-605.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi, ''Juridical Theology'', pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Topics which became staples of written work on the principles of jurisprudence, such as reason versus revelation and interfaith debates regarding abrogation after revelation in Islam versus Judaism, were not even discussed by Shafi'i.

Indeed, even the division of the sources of Sunni law into four {{spaced ndash}} Qur'an, [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]], [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] {{spaced ndash}} was not present in Shafi'is books at all, despite Muslim scholarship generally attributing this division to him.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Qadi al-Nu'man]], one of the earliest jurists to write about usul after Shafi'i did - perhaps during Shafi'is lifetime - was Abū 'Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, who actually considered the sources of law to consist of only three {{spaced ndash}} the Qur'an, the prophetic tradition, and consensus consisting of either scholarly consensus or consensus of the early generations.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"/&gt; This division into four sources is most often attributed to later jurists upon whose work most Sunni jurisprudence has been modeled such as [[Al-Baqillani|Baqillani]] and [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, A history of Islamic legal theories : an introduction to Sunnī uṣūl al-fiqh. Pg. 30-35. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite schools respectively. Thus, the four main sources often attributed to Shafi'i evolved into popular usage long after his death.

Additionally, the later scholars of the four mainstream Sunni schools of law all increased beyond four sources; while the four sources are the most widely accepted, other practices such as the [[Fatwa]]s of the first generation of Muslims and the application of [[pure reason]] are not universally accepted.

===Application of sources===
Even after this evolution, there are still some disputes among Sunni [[jurists]] regarding these four sources and their application. [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and in particular [[Dawud al-Zahiri]] rejected all forms of analogical reason in authentic narrations from them,&lt;ref name=ali280&gt;[[Chiragh Ali]], The Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms. Taken from Modernist Islam 1840-1940: A Sourcebook, pg. 280. Edited by [[Charles Kurzman]]. [[New York City]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mansoor&gt;Mansoor Moaddel, ''Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse'', pg. 32. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuben Levy]], ''Introduction to the Sociology of Islam'', pg. 237, 239 and 245. [[London]]: Williams and Norgate, 1931-1933.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the later [[Maliki]]tes and [[Hanbali]]tes {{spaced ndash}} and in some cases, even [[Zahiri]]tes {{spaced ndash}} gravitated toward the acceptance of varying levels of analogical reason already accepted by [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Hanafi]]tes.&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt; Malik and [[Abu Hanifa]] both accepted pure reason as a source of law; Ahmad and Shafi'i did not, and Shafi'i was especially hostile to [[Istihsan|juristic preference]] as implemented by Abu Hanifa, yet pure reason later found its way into all Sunni schools of law.

The question of consensus has evolved considerably. Abu Hanifa, Ahmad and Zahiri only accepted the consensus of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Muslehuddin, "Philosophy of Islamic Law and Orientalists," Kazi Publications, 1985, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farooq"&gt;Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, "The Doctrine of Ijma: Is there a consensus?," June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while Malik was willing to accept the consensus of the first generation in general or the consensus of later generations within the community of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi'i insinuated that consensus was not practically possible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Majid Khadduri]], Introduction to [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s [[Al-Risala (book)|al-Risala]], pg.33&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of all schools eventually followed the views of [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in expanding the definition of accepted consensus to include scholarly consensus and silent consensus as well.&lt;ref name="farooq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pg. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles within Shia Islam==
In [[Shi'a]] legal theory, analogical reason isn't recognised as a source of law; pure reason is, however.&lt;ref&gt;Moaddel, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ites may differ in the exact application of principles depending on whether they follow the [[Ja'fari]], [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] or [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] subdivisions of Shi'ism.

===Ja'fari principles===

There are two interpretations of what constitutes sources of law among jurists of the Ja'fari school.

*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the "infallibles" (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of the Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is the translation of [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.

====Parts of the Shiite Uşūl al-Fiqh ====
Discussions of this science are presented in various parts in the works of uşūl al-fiqh. However, the best division is presented by al-Muhaqqiq al-Isfahani (d. 1940) in his last course of teaching (as narrated by his great student Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his Uşūl al-Fiqh, p. 11) according to which all uşūlī topics are discussed in the four following parts: Discussions of “terms,” of “intellectual implications,” of “the authority,” and of “practical principles.”
Discussions of terms deal with denotations and appearances of terms from a general aspect, such as appearance of the imperative in the obligation, that of the prohibition in the unlawfulness, and the like.
Discussions of intellectual implications survey implications of precepts even though such precepts may not be inferred from terms, such as discussing truthfulness of mutual implication of intellectual judgments and juristic precepts, of obligation of something necessitating obligation of its preliminaries (known as “the problem of preliminary of the mandatory act”), of obligation of something necessitating unlawfulness of its opposite (known as “the problem of the opposite”), of possibility of conjunction of the command and the prohibition, and so on.
Discussions of the authority investigate whether some specific thing is juristically treated as a proof; for instance, whether report of a single transmitter, appearances, appearances of the Quran, Sunna, consensus, intellect, and the like are authoritative proofs.
Discussions of practical principles deal with what the jurist refers to when he cannot find a persuasive proof, such as the principle of clearance from obligation, that of precaution, and so forth.

===Ismaili principles===
Most early Ismaili works within the field of the principles of jurisprudence were actually responses to Sunni works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qadi al-Nu'man]]'s ''Differences Among the Schools of Law'' is most likely the first of such written responses.

'''''Providentissimus Deus''''', "On the Study of Holy [[Scripture]]", was an [[encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 18 November 1893. In it, he reviewed the history of [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] from the time of the [[Church Fathers]] to the present, spoke against the errors of the [[Rationalism|Rationalists]] and "[[higher criticism|higher critics]]", and outlined principles of scripture study and guidelines for how scripture was to be taught in [[seminary|seminaries]].
He also addressed the issues of apparent contradictions between the Bible and physical [[science]], or between one part of scripture and another, and how such apparent contradictions can be resolved.

==Context==
''Providentissimus Deus'' followed earlier efforts on the part of Pope Leo to promote Catholic education. In 1878, he had encouraged the study of history and archaeology. The 1879 encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' promoted the study of scholastic philosophy. In 1892 Leo authorized the [[École Biblique]] in [[Jerusalem]], the first Catholic school specifically dedicated to the critical study of the bible. With ''Providentissimus Deus'', Pope Leo gave the first formal authorization for the use of critical methods in biblical scholarship.&lt;ref name=Prior&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bYlS2ZgbQV0C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=providentissimus+deus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SpMHW1H03i&amp;sig=4KETKO1T01Y046Hbz2CJj6UQtJA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=R9j3VN21J4K4ggSSu4DoAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=providentissimus%20deus&amp;f=false Prior, Joseph G., ''The Historical Critical Method in Catholic Exegesis'', Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 1999] {{ISBN|9788876528255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Pope Leo XIII instituted the [[Pontifical Biblical Commission]], which was to adapt Roman Catholic Biblical studies to modern scholarship and to protect Scripture against attacks.&lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Commission." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The encyclical contains both a polemic against rationalism, and a defense of divine authorship, inspiration, and inerrancy.&lt;ref name=Prior/&gt;
Leo responded to two challenges to biblical authority, both of which arose during the 19th century.

The historical-critical method of analyzing scripture questioned the reliability of the Bible.
Leo acknowledged the possibility of errors introduced by scribes but forbade the interpretation that only some of scripture is inerrant, while other elements are fallible. Leo condemned that use that certain scholars made of new evidence, clearly referring to [[Alfred Firmin Loisy]] and [[Maurice Le Sage d'Hauteroche d'Hulst|Maurice d'Hulst]], although not by name.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"/&gt;

Leo argued that as science and theology are separate disciplines they do not contradict each other, provided that scholars keep to their respective areas of expertise. The scientist should not view the biblical writers as explaining the visible world, as that was not their intent. Biblical scholars should be aware that the writers may have used figurative language or descriptions from appearances.&lt;ref name=Prior/&gt;

At first, both conservatives and liberals found elements in the encyclical to which to appeal. Over the next decade, however, Modernism spread and the encyclical was increasingly interpreted in a conservative sense.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Provdentissimus Deus." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This encyclical was part of an ongoing conflict between Modernists and conservatives.

==''Divino Afflante Spiritu''==
On September 30, 1943, [[Pope Pius XII]] issued his encyclical on “The Most Opportune Way to Promote Biblical Studies,” ''[[Divino Afflante Spiritu]]'' (“Inspired by the Divine Spirit”), in commemoration of ''Providentissimus Deus''.

'''Renewable energy commercialization''' involves the [[Diffusion of innovations|deployment]] of three generations of [[renewable energy]] technologies dating back more than 100 years. First-generation technologies, which are already mature and economically competitive, include [[biomass]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[wind power]], [[List of solar thermal power stations|solar thermal power stations]], and modern forms of [[bioenergy]]. Third-generation technologies require continued [[R&amp;D]] efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

Renewable energy continued its rapid growth in 2015, providing multiple benefits.

=== Rationale for renewables ===
[[Climate change]], pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems, and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures.&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf
|title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to [[energy security|world energy security]], reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, and provide opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; Climate-disrupting [[fossil fuels]] are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy. The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind, the energy coming from the sun, and heat from within the earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester R. Brown]]. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', [[Earth Policy Institute]], 2009, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517214450/http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2016 |title=Public Opinion on Global Issues: Chapter 5b: World Opinion on Energy Security |author=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=18 January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, [[Eurobarometer]] polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target "to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further. Across the EU, 57 percent thought the proposed goal was "about right" and 16 percent thought it was "too modest." In comparison, 19 percent said it was "too ambitious".&lt;ref name="worldpublicopinion.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |title=Large Majorities in US and Europe Endorse Focus on Renewable Energy |date=18 January 2012 |work=World Public Opinion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315003300/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear plant]] have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for "next generation" nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2014 [[REN21]] Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources, but ways to address pressing social, political, economic and environmental problems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, renewables are seen not only as sources of energy, but also as tools to address many other pressing needs, including: improving energy security; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; improving educational opportunities; creating jobs; reducing poverty; and increasing gender equality... Renewables have entered the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf  |title= Renewables 2014 Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |date=2014 |work=(Paris: REN21 Secretariat) |isbn=978-3-9815934-2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 for the first time, more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States, demonstrating a "fundamental transition" of the world's energy markets towards renewables, according to a report released by [[REN21]], a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris.&lt;ref name=Mart/&gt; In 2010, renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities.&lt;ref name="UNEP_GT_2011_Fig24"&gt;[http://www.fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 UNEP, Bloomberg, Frankfurt School, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101180801/http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 |date=1 November 2011 }}、Figure 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2011, total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,360 GW, up 8%. Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208 GW of capacity added globally during 2011. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted for almost 40% and 30% .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf  Renewables 2012 Global status report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215215616/http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf |date=15 December 2012 }} Executive summary REN21&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 |pages=13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/media/sefi2011finallowres.pdf pg25graph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010).

The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." He added: "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".&lt;ref name=invest2011/&gt;

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power plants may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. The IEA has said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity".&lt;ref name="ieaiea2011"/&gt;

In 2013, China led the world in [[renewable energy]] production, with a total capacity of 378 [[Gigawatt|GW]], mainly from [[hydroelectric]] and [[wind power]]. As of 2014, China leads the world in the production and use of wind power, [[solar power|solar photovoltaic power]] and [[smart grid]] technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and [[solar energy]] as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power]] capacity. Since 2005, production of [[solar cells]] in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.&lt;ref name=chinaen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/economics-manufacture-renewables-to-build-energy-security-1.15847 |title=Economics: Manufacture renewables to build energy security |author1=John A.

===Economic trends===
[[File:US projected cost of wind power.png|thumb|The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] projects that the levelized cost of wind power will decline about 25% from 2012 to 2030.&lt;ref name=review&gt;E. Lantz, M. Hand, and R. Wiser ( 13–17 May 2012) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54526.pdf "The Past and Future Cost of Wind Energy,"] National Renewable Energy Laboratory conference paper no. 6A20-54526, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.&lt;ref name=invest2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/renewables-investment-breaks-records |title=Renewables Investment Breaks Records |date=29 August 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt;

=== Three generations of technologies ===
Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies, reaching back over 100&amp;nbsp;years:

*"''First-generation technologies'' emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] [[combustion]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. These technologies are quite widely used.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Second-generation technologies'' include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]], and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crises]] of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Third-generation technologies'' are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Advances in [[nanotechnology]] may also play a major role".&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; First-generation technologies are well established, second-generation technologies are entering markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

== First-generation technologies ==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|rechts|Biomass heating plant in Austria. The total heat power is about 1000 kW.]]

First-generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources. Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential, particularly in developing countries, and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance.

=== Biomass ===

[[Biomass]] for heat and power is a fully [[mature technology]] which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One of the problems of biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb| The 22,500 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], the largest hydroelectric power station in the world.]]
[[Hydroelectricity]] is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. [[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt;

=== Geothermal power and heat ===
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|right|West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|One of many power plants at [[The Geysers]], a geothermal power field in northern California, with a total output of over 750&amp;nbsp;MW]]

[[Geothermal power]] plants can operate 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day, providing [[baseload]] capacity. Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 to as much as 6,000 GW.&lt;ref&gt;

In: O. Hohmeyer and T. Trittin (Eds.), IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources, Proceedings, Luebeck, Germany, 20–25 January 2008, p. 59-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008.&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt; The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity, representing 3.1 GW. Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines (1.9 GW), Indonesia (1.2 GW), Mexico (1.0 GW), Italy (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.6 GW), Japan (0.5 GW), and New Zealand (0.5 GW).&lt;ref name="IPCC Geothermal 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply, such as in the Philippines, where geothermal represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

Leonora Walet. [https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5A43HC20091105 Philippines targets $2.5 billion geothermal development], ''Reuters'', 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geothermal (ground source) heat pumps represented an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity at the end of 2008, with other direct uses of geothermal heat (i.e., for space heating, agricultural drying and other uses) reaching an estimated 15 GWth. {{As of|2008}}, at least 76 countries use direct geothermal energy in some form.&lt;ref name=renewables/&gt;

== Second-generation technologies ==

Second-generation technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNEP2 /&gt;

=== Solar heating ===
[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a [[soft energy technology]].]]
{{See also|Solar hot water}}

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of [[solar thermal collector]]s, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869–8778&lt;/ref&gt; The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |date=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy. {{As of|2009}}, China has 27 million rooftop solar water heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Brown. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', Earth Policy Institute, 2009, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photovoltaics ===

{{Main article|Photovoltaics|List of photovoltaic power stations}}
[[File:Solar-crop.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaks at the [[DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center]].]]

Photovoltaic (PV) cells, also called [[solar cell]]s, convert light into electricity. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used to provide [[remote-area power supply]], but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing [[building integrated photovoltaics]] and [[photovoltaic power station]]s for grid connected applications.

Many solar [[photovoltaic power station]]s have been built, mainly in Europe.&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;Denis Lenardic. [http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 – 50] ''PVresources.com'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] (USA, 247 MW)&lt;!--possibly AC--&gt;, [[Charanka Solar Park]] (India, 214 MW), [[Golmud Solar Park]] (China, 200 MW), [[Perovo Solar Park]] (Russia 100 MW), [[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Canada, 97 MW), [[Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark]] (Germany 91 MW), [[Solarpark Finow Tower]] (Germany 84.7 MW), [[Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station]] (Italy, 84.2 MW), [[Eggebek Solar Park]] (Germany 83.6 MW), [[Senftenberg Solarpark]] (Germany 82 MW), [[Finsterwalde Solar Park]] (Germany, 80.7 MW), [[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] (Russia, 80&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Lopburi Solar Farm]] (Thailand 73.16 MW), [[Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Italy, 72 MW), and the [[Lieberose Photovoltaic Park]] (Germany, 71.8&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt;

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

As of 2014, the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry's New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global [[ethanol]] production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17&amp;nbsp;billion to more than 52&amp;nbsp;billion litres, while [[biodiesel]] expanded more than tenfold from less than 1&amp;nbsp;billion to almost 11&amp;nbsp;billion litres. Biofuels provide 1.8% of the world's transport fuel and recent estimates indicate a continued high growth. The main producing countries for transport biofuels are the USA, Brazil, and the EU.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (2009).

[[Brazil]] has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of [[ethanol fuel]] from [[sugar cane]], and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:EthanolPetrol.jpg|right|thumb|Information on pump, California]]

Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol, a mix known as E10,&lt;ref&gt;

Erica Gies. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/business/energy-environment/25iht-rbogeth.html?src=busln As Ethanol Booms, Critics Warn of Environmental Effect] ''The New York Times'', 24 June 2010.

&lt;/ref&gt; and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] are among the automobile companies that sell [[flexible-fuel]] cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which calls for {{convert|7.5|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, will also help to expand the market.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;Worldwatch Institute and Center for American Progress (2006). [http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf ''American energy: The renewable path to energy security'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, "the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion. It also contributed about $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels".&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

== Third-generation technologies ==

Third-generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency, [[cellulosic ethanol]] biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;

International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/weo2006.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' (PDF)].

&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as [[Corn stover|corn stalks]], wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and [[municipal solid waste]] are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]], are also promising cellulose sources that can be [[Sustainable biofuel|sustainably produced]] in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

=== Ocean energy ===

[[Ocean energy]] is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy, tidal energy, river current, ocean current energy, offshore wind, salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy.&lt;ref name=OE1&gt;[http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ ''Ocean energy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031162616/http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ |date=31 October 2012 }} EPRI Ocean Energy Web Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rance Tidal Power Station]] (240 MW) is the world's first [[tidal power|tidal]] power station. The facility is located on the estuary of the [[Rance River]], in [[Brittany]], France. Opened on 26 November 1966, it is currently operated by [[Électricité de France]], and is the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity.

First proposed more than thirty years ago, systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology. The potential for this technology is considered promising, especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees:&lt;ref name=je&gt;Jeff Scruggs and Paul Jacob. Harvesting Ocean Wave Energy, ''Science'', Vol. 323, 27 February 2009, p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are currently nine projects, completed or in-development, off the coasts of the United Kingdom, United States, Spain and Australia to harness the rise and fall of waves by [[Ocean Power Technologies]]. The current maximum power output is 1.5 MW ([[Reedsport, Oregon]]), with development underway for 100 MW ([[Coos Bay, Oregon]]).&lt;ref name=OPT&gt;[http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html ''Projects''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401203800/http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html |date=1 April 2012 }} Ocean Power Technologies Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhanced geothermal systems ===

{{As of|2008}}, geothermal power development was under way in more than 40 countries, partially attributable to the development of new technologies, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems.&lt;ref name=renewables&gt;[[REN21]] (2009). [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612132038/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf |date=12 June 2009 }} pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range than "traditional" Geothermal systems. Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the USA, Australia, Germany, France, and The United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Advanced solar concepts ===
Beyond the already established [[solar photovoltaics]] and solar thermal power technologies are such advanced solar concepts as the solar updraft tower or space-based solar power. These concepts have yet to (if ever) be commercialized.  
{{See also|Solar updraft tower}}
The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a [[Renewable energy|renewable-energy]] [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.

A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] (AVE) which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
{{See also|Space-based solar power}}
'''Space-based solar power''' ('''SBSP''') is the concept of collecting [[solar power]] in [[Outer space|space]] (using an "SPS", that is, a "solar-power satellite" or a "satellite power system") for use on [[Earth]]. It has been in research since the early 1970s. SBSP would differ from current [[Sun|solar]] collection methods in that the means used to collect [[energy]] would reside on an [[orbit]]ing [[satellite]] instead of on Earth's surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing [[atmosphere]] and night [[time]] in [[space]].

The PV industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{cite web |url= http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf |title= Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author1=M Bazilian |author2=I Onyeji |author3=M Liebreich |author4=I MacGill |author5=J Chase |author6=J Shah |author7=D Gielen... |date=  2013 |work=Renewable Energy (53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-technical barriers to acceptance ==
Many energy markets, institutions, and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System and Transmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]]  |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants.&lt;ref name=epsov/&gt; Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables.&lt;ref name=epsov&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. "Rejecting Renewables: The Socio-technical Impediments to Renewable Electricity in the United States," ''Energy Policy'', 37(11) (November 2009), p. 4500.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has argued that "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about ''culture'' and ''institutions'' than engineering and science".&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin K. Sovacool. "The Cultural Barriers to Renewable Energy in the United States," ''Technology in Society'', 31(4) (November 2009), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political, not technical,&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 45.
&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many studies which have identified a range of "non-technical barriers" to renewable energy use.&lt;ref name=ieapress/&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (2006). ''Nontechnical Barriers to Solar Energy Use: Review of Recent Literature'', Technical Report, NREL/TP-520-40116, September, 30 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS&gt;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, (2005). [http://www.ppre.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Downloads/Global_RE-Report-2005.pdf Increasing Global Renewable Energy Market Share: Recent Trends and Perspectives] Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing, institutional, or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy. Key barriers include:&lt;ref name="NREL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;

* Difficulty overcoming established energy systems, which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems, particularly for [[distributed generation]] such as photovoltaics, because of technological lock-in, electricity markets designed for centralized power plants, and market control by established operators. As the [[Stern Review|Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids."&lt;ref name=Stern2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Lack of government policy support, which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development. Examples include [[fossil fuel subsidies|subsidies for fossil-fuels]], insufficient consumer-based [[renewable energy incentives]], government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents, and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy.
* Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness.
* Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies.
* Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects, including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.
* Imperfect capital markets, which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy (e.g., effects of air pollution, risk of supply disruption)&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/earth/20fossil.html Fossil Fuels’ Hidden Cost Is in Billions, Study Says] ''The New York Times'', 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy (e.g., cleaner air, energy security).
* Inadequate workforce skills and training, which includes lack of adequate scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.
* Lack of adequate codes, standards, utility interconnection, and net-metering guidelines.
* Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics.
* Lack of stakeholder/community participation and co-operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects.

With such a wide range of non-technical barriers, there is no "silver bullet" solution to drive the transition to renewable energy. So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers.&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels. The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector, as well as reflecting specific social, economic and environmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource-rich countries struggle to move away from fossil fuels and have failed thus far to adopt regulatory frameworks necessary for developing renewable energy (e.g. Russia).&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy landscape ==
Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations. As the [[Stern Review]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a liberalised energy market, investors, operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions. But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.&lt;ref name=Stern2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[International Solar Energy Society]] has stated that "historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use".&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel energy systems have different production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable.&lt;ref name=jacob2010/&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] states that the market "does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices, it does not value nature's services adequately, and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems".&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt; It also favors the near term over the long term, thereby showing limited concern for future generations.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;

Norton &amp; Co, pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; though is also problematic to combine different international normative regimes regulating this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=Energy Trade and the WTO: Implications for Renewable Energy and the OPEC Cartel|journal=Journal of International Economic Law (JIEL), Georgetown University Law Center|date=2013|volume=4|ssrn=2330416|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shifting taxes ===
Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists. It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities, in order to create a more responsive market. For example, a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air, the costs of acid rain damage, and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies. Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In 2001, Sweden launched a new 10-year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30&amp;nbsp;billion kroner ($3.9&amp;nbsp;billion) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities. Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Asia's two leading economies, Japan and China, are considering carbon taxes.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

=== Shifting subsidies ===
{{See also|Energy subsidies}}
Just as there is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30&amp;nbsp;years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Lester Brown has argued that "a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil. Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth's climate."&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The International Solar Energy Society advocates "leveling the playing field" by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R&amp;D, in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate-disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989 to $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by 46&amp;nbsp;percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750&amp;nbsp;million in 1993 to $240&amp;nbsp;million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt; However, the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt;

In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development, however, require coordination and regulation at a global level, as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others, thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the [[European Union]] has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU [[energy mix]] and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.&lt;ref name=UNEP3&gt;United Nations Environment Program (2006).  [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf ''Changing climates: The Role of Renewable Energy in a Carbon-constrained World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055332/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some [[developing countries]]. Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Egypt, Mali, and South Africa. The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

===Levelling the playing field===
The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to "more effectively compete for private sector capital".
*"First, energy prices must appropriately reflect the "true cost" of energy (e.g. through carbon pricing) so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account". Example: [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|New UK nuclear plants]] cost £92.50/MWh,&lt;ref name=bbcstrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24604218|title=UK nuclear power plant gets go-ahead|date=21 October 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telestrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10392510/Hinkley-Point-good-for-Britain-says-Ed-Davey.html|title=Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to create 25,000 jobs, says Cameron|date=21 October 2013|author1=Roland Gribben  |author2=Denise Roland |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with €74.2/MWh&lt;ref&gt;Erin Gill.

Accessed: 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Second, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed, while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy".
*"Third, governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower-carbon energy options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/IEA%20Tracking%20Clean%20Energy%20Progress%20report%202012.pdf |title=Tracking Clean Energy Progress |author=IEA |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green stimulus programs ===
In response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis in the late 2000s]], the world's major governments made "green stimulus" programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery. Some {{US$|188 billion}} in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency, to be spent mainly in 2010 and in 2011.&lt;ref name=ren27&gt;[[REN21]] (2010).

===Energy sector regulation===
Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="PURC"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

These initiatives go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states. The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits. The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market.

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt; The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills.

== Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity ==
Voluntary markets, also referred to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm |title= Voluntary and mandatory markets |date= 25 March 2013|work= |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving factors behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive. According to the directive, the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a "guarantee of origin" must be issued (article 15). Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production. In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green-e program managed by [[Center for Resource Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-e.org/about.shtml |title= About Green-e |year= 2013|work= |publisher= Center for Resource Solutions |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the main voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is [[EKOenergy]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130704002836/http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-07-04 |title= Frequently asked questions |date= March 2013 |work=  |publisher= EKOenergy Network |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;REN21. (2013).

==100% renewable energy==
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of the total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111081913/http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main article|Efficient energy use}}

Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;

InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency. Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;

American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Russell Sage Foundation''' is an American philanthropic [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] that primarily funds research relating to income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Callahan|first1=David|title=Inside the Russell Sage Foundation's Epic Dig Into Why Inequality Matters|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2015/4/14/inside-the-russell-sage-foundations-epic-dig-into-why-inequa.html|accessdate=15 June 2016|publisher=Inside Philanthropy|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in New York City, it is a research center and a funding source for studies by scholars at other academic and research institutions. The foundation also publishes, under its own imprint, the books that derive from the work of its grantees and visiting scholars. The foundation focuses on [[Labour economics|labor markets]], [[immigration]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], and [[social inequality]] in the United States, as well as [[behavioral economics]].

The Russell Sage Foundation was established in 1907 for "the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States" by a gift of $10 million from [[Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage]] (1828–1918), widow of railroad magnate and financier [[Russell Sage]].&lt;ref name="Olivia Sage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/collections/sage/essays.html | title=Margaret Olivia Slocum (Mrs. Russell) Sage (1828-1918): Founder of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Auburn University Libraries | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Sage directed the foundation to pursue its mission through a broad set of activities, including "research, publication, education, the establishment and maintenance of charitable or benevolent activities, agencies and institutions, and the aid of any such activities, agencies, or institutions already in existence."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/history | title=History of the Russell Sage Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Soon after its establishment, the Foundation played a pioneering role in dealing with problems of the poor and the elderly, in efforts to improve hospital and prison conditions, and in the development of social work as a profession.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wenocur and Michael Reisch, From Charity to Enterprise: The Development of American Social Work in a Market Economy  (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation was also responsible for early reforms in [[health care]], [[city planning]], [[consumer]] [[Credit (finance)|credit]], [[labor law]], the training of nurses, and [[social security]] programs.&lt;ref name="A Brief History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/u4/Brief%20History%20of%20RSF.pdf | title=Celebrating 100 Years | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=June 2016}}
 
In 1907, the foundation funded the [[Pittsburgh Survey]],&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Survey"&gt;"The Pittsburgh Survey," by Paul Kellogg in "Charities and the Commons" 1909&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic effort to survey working class conditions in a large U.S. city. Considered a major [[Progressive Era]] achievement, the findings inspired labor reforms and helped end twelve-hour days and seven-day weeks for steel workers.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1909 and 1922, the Foundation spent nearly a sixth of its capital to build [[Forest Hills Gardens]], a model suburban community for working families designed by architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. The aim was to demonstrate the economic and social viability of an intelligently planned suburban community.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn et al. (1947), p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The first lots sold for $800, and a new suburb began thriving by 1917, but housing prices soon soared beyond the range of the families they were intended for.&lt;ref name="A Brief History" /&gt;

In 1922, the Foundation helped launch the [[Regional Plan Association]] to research, write and publish a plan to guide the future development of the New York metropolitan region.  In its first 40 years, the Foundation spent more than $1 million on the Regional Survey and Plan. Researchers completed 12 massive volumes as part of the effort, with the first being published in 1928-29.&lt;ref name="Regional Plan"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Harold |editor1-last=Keele |others=Joseph C. Kiger |title=Foundations |edition=1984 |year=1984 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |page=376 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RPA was not opposed to the growth of the area and its population, but believed that for the development to be efficient and orderly, it had to be properly managed; only in this way could businesses continue to grow and the city maintain its global impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=187-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation also provided support for [[social feminist]]s such as [[Mary van Kleeck]], founder of the [[International Institute of Industrial Relations]].&lt;ref name=Alvon&gt;{{cite book|first1=Guy|author1=Alvon|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Daniel|title=A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor|date=1992|publisher=Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus Ohio|url=https://ohiostatepress.org/Books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1980===
Since [[World War II]], the Foundation has devoted its efforts to strengthening the social sciences as a means of achieving more informed and rational social policy. It launched a variety of programs to draw the social sciences closer to decision-makers in other professions, from policymakers to health care providers. This initiative included funds for research on "social indicators", a collection of data that measure the quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Indicators Research|"Social indicators"]] on the Russell Sage Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt;

([[Mary Van Kleek]], who headed the foundation in the late 1940s, was a member of the [[American Labor Party]] and served on a committee for the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Withering&gt;

In the 1950s, the Foundation supported research on the practice and aims of [[philanthropy]]. It established the [[Foundation Center]], a non-profit that maintains data on organized philanthropy. It was also the first to publish ''The Foundation Directory'', a comprehensive listing of the nation’s several thousand largest foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fconline.foundationcenter.org/ | title=90% of U.S. Foundations don't have websites | last= | first= | date= | website=Foundation Directory Online | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this decade, the foundation also received money from the Ford Foundation ($554,000) for the "practical utilization of the behavioral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ford Foundation Annual Report|last=|first=|publisher=The Ford Foundation|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Foundation turned to [[medical ethics]], including [[patients' rights]], extreme measures to sustain life, and the use of human subjects in research. Foundation-supported books from this period include Bernard Barber’s ''Drugs and Society'' (1967) and ''The Dying Patient'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.russellsage.org/publications/dying-patient|title=The Dying Patient {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s – present===

In 1993, the Foundation also established the Behavioral Economics Roundtable,&lt;ref name=BE /&gt; a group of behavioral economists elected by grantees in the program and charged to design initiatives to advance the field. Three charter members of the Roundtable subsequently received the Noble Prize in economics: [[George Akerlof]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The Foundation launched new programs to study immigration, the rise of economic inequality and contact among cultures within the American population. Between 1992 and 2000, the Foundation worked with the [[Ford Foundation]] to conduct a Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/multi-city-study-urban-inequality | title=Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Foundation partnered with the [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) to produce ''The American People: Census 2000'', edited by Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan and John Haaga of PRB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/publications/american-people | title=The American People | last=Farley | first=Reynolds | date= September 2005 | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Foundation partnered with the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] on an initiative exploring the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/co-funded-projects|title=Co-Funded Research {{!}} Russell Sage Foundation|website=www.russellsage.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, the Foundation launched ''RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences'', a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access|open-access]] journal of social science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsfjournal.org/|title=RSF Journal|website=www.rsfjournal.org|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

===Research===
The Foundation currently pursues four principal programs:
* A program of research on the Future of Work concerned principally with the causes and consequences of changes in the quality of [[low-wage work]] in the United States and other advanced economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/future-work | title=Future of Work | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration concerned with the social, economic, and political effects of the changing racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population, including the transformation of communities and ideas about what it means to be American. This program was formed to replace two prior programs, Immigration and Cultural Contact, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/race-ethnicity-immigration | title=Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program on Social Inequality, focused on the social effects of rising economic inequality, with particular attention to the ways in which the U.S. political and educational systems have responded to growing economic disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/social-inequality | title=Social Inequality | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A program of research on Behavioral Economics which incorporates the insights of psychology and other social sciences into the study of economic behavior.&lt;ref name=BE /&gt;

The principal programs feature a number of working groups:
*The Biology and Social Science Working Group examines how the incorporation of biological concepts, processes and measures in social science research might improve our understanding of a range of social and economic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/biology-and-social-science | title=Biology and Social Science (BioSS) Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Racial Bias in Policing Working Group examines the impact of racial, ethnic, and gender-based attitudes on law enforcement. The group is working with metropolitan police departments across the U.S. to develop policies to reduce racial bias in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/research/working-groups/rsf-working-group-racial-bias-policing | title=Racial Bias in Policing Working Group | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Cultural Contact and Immigration Working Group examines immigrant life outside of customary gateway cities such as New York, Miami, or Los Angeles, with an emphasis on the cultural frictions resulting from the rapid growth of the foreign-born population in the United States at a time of high economic uncertainty and political polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/awarded-project/working-group-cultural-contact-and-immigration | title=Working Group on Cultural Contact and Immigration | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the activities sponsored under its main programs, the Foundation also currently supports a special initiative on the social, economic and political effects of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/special-initiatives/affordable-care-act | title=The Social, Economic and Political Effects of the Affordable Care Act | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 07.JPG|thumb|267px|2008 conference booth]]

===Visiting Scholars and Journalists programs===
The Russell Sage Foundation has established a center where Visiting Scholars can pursue their writing and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.russellsage.org/about/what-we-do/visiting-scholars-program | title=Visiting Scholars Program | last= | first= | date= | website=Russell Sage Foundation | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Foundation invites a number of scholars to its New York City headquarters to investigate topics in social and behavioral sciences. The Foundation particularly welcomes groups of scholars who wish to collaborate on a specific project during their residence at Russell Sage. Typically Visiting Scholars work on projects related to the Foundation’s current programs.

In 2015 the Foundation established a Visiting Journalists program to support journalists undertaking original research on social, political, and economic conditions in the United States. 

====Robert K. Merton Scholar====
* In 1990, [[Robert K. Merton]] became the first Foundation Scholar at Russell Sage, recognizing his long and invaluable service as an adviser to the administration and a mentor to other visiting scholars.
* In 2000, [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel]]ist [[Robert M. Solow]] became the second Foundation Scholar, following Merton’s retirement. In 2003, the position was renamed the Merton Scholar.

===Archives===
The Foundation's archives are located in the Rockefeller Archive Center in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rockarch.org/ | title=“If we assist the highest forms of education – in whatever field – we secure the widest influence in enlarging the boundaries of human knowledge.” | last= | first= | date= | website=Rockefeller Archive Center | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Russell Sage Foundation Building}}[[File:Russell Sage Foundation Building.jpg|thumb|left|192px|The former headquarters of the Russell Sage Foundation on [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]]]

==Headquarters buildings==

When the Foundation was formed, it attempted to locate its offices in the [[United Charities Building]] on [[Park Avenue South]] and East 22nd Street in [[Manhattan]], but was unable to do so as the building was fully rented; instead, the new foundation spread out to a number of locations in the area. In 1912, Margaret Sage and [[Robert W. DeForest]] decided to construct a headquarters building for the Foundation which would also serve as a memorial to her late husband. They engaged [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[Grosvenor Atterbury]], who had designed the [[Forest Hills Gardens]] model housing project for the Foundation in 1908, to design the building, and purchased property at 120 [[22nd Street (Manhattan)|East 22nd Street]] at the corner of [[Lexington Avenue]], just down the street from both United Charities Building and the [[Church Missions House]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], and a short block from [[Gramercy Park]]. The building, which was originally nine stories before a penthouse was added in the 1920s, was constructed between 1912 and 1913 and altered in 1922-1923.  A fifteen-story extension on East 22nd, which Atterbury also designed, connected to the original building with a five-story "hyphen", was added between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref name=gna&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension/122_130e22.htm | title=Proposed Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 5-story connector building was necessitated by a covenant to the deed for the site, which was sold to the Foundation by the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]].  The intention was to preserve access to sunlight for the hotel's north-facing rooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russell Sage Foundation Headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The Foundation's current headquarters]]

Atterbury's design took the form of a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance]] [[Florence|Florentine]] [[palazzo]]. Because it was both headquarters for the Foundation and a physical memorial for Sage, the building was more opulently constructed than would generally be the case for a charity.  Atterbury utilized expensive materials in the interior, such as rare Kingwood [[sandstone]] in the elevators.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt; The 1922-1923 alteration added second floor sculptural panels by [[Rene Paul Chambellan]] illustrating the foundation's ideals, goals and deeds.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The Foundation made available space in the main building, at no charge, to other social-service organizations, such as the Family Welfare Association of America, the American Association of Social Workers and the Library of Social Work, which took up the top two floors of the main building. Space in the 22nd Street extension was rented out, and the New York School of Social Work was the primary tenant.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;

The Foundation sold the building in 1949 to the [[Archdiocese of New York]] which used it as the headquarters of [[Catholic Charities]], and it was sold again in 1975, after which it was converted to apartments; it is now called '''Sage House'''.&lt;ref name=gna /&gt;  The building was designated a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]] in 2000,&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of a proposed extension to the [[Gramercy Park Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension.htm | title=Proposed Gramercy Park Historic District Extension | last= | first= | date=31 August 1998 | website=Preserve &amp; Protect | accessdate=10 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, the Foundation has been headquartered in a [[Philip Johnson]]-designed [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] building at 112 [[64th Street (Manhattan)|East 64th Street]] between [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington]] Avenues, built in 1958-1960 for the [[Asia Society]] and [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]]. The building is located in the [[Upper East Side Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AIA4}}, p.391&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' ({{lang-tr|Sakarya Üniversitesi Ortadoğu Enstitüsü}}, also known as '''ORMER''') is located on the campus of [[Sakarya University]] in Sakarya, Turkey. Its mission is to enhance understanding the Middle East and contribute with rigorous programs to research and teaching on the people, economies, religions and politics of the region. As part of this mission, the institute hosts graduate programs and organizes academic conferences and events. Almost half of ORMER’s graduate students are international, coming mostly from the Balkans, the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. ORMER has more than 10 full-time faculty and 18 research assistants.

==History==
The idea of Sakarya University Middle East Institute goes back to the year 2005 when the first issue of Middle East Annual ('''Ortadoğu Yıllığı''') was published by a group of academics including the founding director of the institute, [[Kemal Inat]]. In the aftermath of the [[Arab Spring]], this idea turned a concrete step with the opening of a master program on the Middle East under the Social Science Institute of [[Sakarya University]] in May 2012. At the same year, an online master program on the Middle East was also inaugurated. Those who opened Master-level programs organized the first Middle East Congress on Politics and Society between 9 and 11 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchturkey.org/middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening of another Middle East program at PhD level, '''the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Sakarya University''' was established on 11 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/12/20131211-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the center was the effect of the [[Arab Spring]] on politics, society and economy of the Middle East. Accordingly, the second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized in order to deal with effects of the Arab Spring on the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/ii-middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:ormer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Building of Middle East Institute]]
According to founding director of the institute, Turkey's need for academically-educated experts on the Middle East became a problem especially after two important political developments in the opening years of the 21st Century, rising interest of Turkey towards the Middle East region, and political turmoil following the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakaryayenigun.com.tr/19039-uzmanlar-burada-yetisiyor-haberi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by these political developments, the center reorganized itself as an institute. Therefore, Sakarya University Middle East Institute was officially established on May 25, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2015/06/20150605-25-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and all graduate programs and staff were transferred to this institute. However, the institute continues to use ORMER as its abbreviation. ORMER is a shortened form of '''Ortadoğu Merkezi''' (Middle East Center).

==Graduate programs==
'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' mainly offers graduate programs of study at both MA level and PhD level. Both MA and PhD programs cover a wide range of elective courses (such as media, international relations, postcolonial studies, religion, and sociology).

'''Master of Arts''' (MA) - This two-year degree program is research-focused, allowing students to produce an original 15,000-word thesis. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes contemporary Middle Eastern politics, Middle Eastern history, Middle Eastern economies, and Islamic studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

'''Doctor of Philosophy''' (PhD) - This at least four-year degree program is research-focused, composing three stages, completion of coursework, a [[comprehensive examination]], and a dissertation. After student complete first two stages, they are expected to produce an original dissertation. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes political theories with a special focus on the Middle East, Islamic philosophy, religious studies, and security studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

In addition to graduate programs, ORMER also provides courses on main Middle Eastern languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew.

==Activities==
As part of its mission, Sakarya University Middle East Institute offers a variety of opportunities including conferences, lecture series, workshops, and outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also publishes booklets, detailed reports, policy briefs, and short commentaries on current affairs of the Middle East.

The main activity of the institute is to organize '''Middle East Congress on Politics and Society''' biennially. Prior to the establishment of the institute, this congress was organized firstly by [[Department of International Relations, Sakarya University]] in 2012. The second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at [[Sakarya University]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/i-middle-eastern-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Quds_hall.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Jerusalem Hall in Middle East Institute Building]]

==Ibn Khaldun Library==
The Ibn Khaldun Library, which is named after the leading Islamic sociologist [[Ibn Khaldun]], is one of the largest libraries collecting books on the Middle East in [[Turkey]]. It contains over 10,000 books, and many periodicals focusing on the Middle East. Although it is a newly established library, it includes a significant number of academic sources on [[postcolonial studies]]. The library also provides Web access to its own holdings, and the holdings of the main library of [[Sakarya University]].

The library is located on the first floor of the institute building.

==Periodicals==
In addition to policy briefs, and short commentaries published in its web page on occasion, '''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' is the editorial home to a peer-review academic journal and a peer-review academic annual, both of which focus particularly on the Middle East.

[[The Middle East Annual]], ({{lang-tr|Ortadoğu Yıllığı}}), published since 2005, covers political, economic and societal developments in each country of the Middle East.

[[Turkish Journal of Middle Eastern Studies]] ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Ortadoğu Çalışmaları Dergisi}}),&lt;ref&gt;http://tjmes.org/index.php/TJMES&lt;/ref&gt; published since 2014, is a peer-review academic journal.

{{Distinguish | Sir William Dunn School of Pathology}}
The '''Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry''' at [[Cambridge University]] is a research institute endowed from the estate of [[Sir William Dunn]], which was the origin of the Cambridge Department of Biochemistry.  Created for [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins]] on the recommendation of [[Walter Morley Fletcher]], it opened in 1924 and spurred the growth of '''Hopkins's school of biochemistry'''.  Hopkins's school dominated the discipline of biochemistry from the 1920s through the interwar years and was the source of many leaders of the next generation of biochemists, and the Dunn bequest inaugurated a period of rapid expansion for biochemistry.

==Origin of the Institute==
In 1918, a trustee of the estate of Sir William Dunn approached a Cambridge biologist, [[William Bate Hardy]], about the possibility of putting some of Dunn's estate toward biomedical science research.  Hardy referred the trustee ([[Charles D. Seligman]]) to [[Walter Morley Fletcher]], the secretary of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].  The Dunn estate, like much of the philanthropy world, was beginning to look more to "preventive" philanthropy (as opposed to direct aid to the needy) by sponsoring research institutions that could address social ills.  Between 1919 and 1925, Fletcher convinced the Dunn trustees to put nearly half a million pounds toward biomedical research.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''From medical chemistry to biochemistry'', pp. 76-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher was a long-time friend and institutional ally of Frederick Gowland Hopkins, a pioneering biochemist who was trying to establish "general biochemistry" as a field distinct from either medical physiology or organic chemistry, more a part of biology than medicine.  Fletcher lobbied for the Dunn estate to fund Hopkins's proposal, among the over 500 funding proposals submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, "Walter Fletcher, F. G. Hopkins, and the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry", pp. 332-333&lt;/ref&gt;  By late 1919, Fletcher was negotiating for a considerable endowment that would allow Hopkins to create an institute solely devoted to biochemistry.  The approval of this endowment, ultimately about 210,000 pounds, reversed the declining fortunes of Hopkins's research group, which had been suffering from lack of available academic positions, research space, and able students since [[World War I]].  With funding in the works, Hopkins group expanded from 10 researchers in 1920 to 59 in 1925; in 1922 they began using endowment funds and in 1924 the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry opened.  Hopkins became the first [[Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry]] and head of the new University of Cambridge Department of Biochemistry, and he appointed researchers in a range of specialized fields covering the whole of what he considered the proper, broad domain of biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, ''From medical chemistry to biochemistry'', pp. 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hopkins's school of biochemistry==
Hopkins's school, housed in the Dunn Institute, was both productive and influential.  Between World War I and [[World War II]], 40% of the papers in the ''[[Biochemical Journal]]'' were authored by Hopkins and other Cambridge biochemists.  Hopkins's program of "general biochemistry" was unique in having a stable institutional base (unlike in Germany, where there were only a scattered handful of biochemistry professorships) but not being dependent on a medical school (unlike the biochemistry and physiological chemistry departments in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, "Walter Fletcher, F. G. Hopkins, and the Dunn Institute of Biochemistry", pp. 330-332&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dunn Institute under Hopkins had another unusual feature for the time: Hopkins did not discriminate against hiring [[Jewish]] scientists, unlike the large majority of American, British and German universities and medical schools.  This may have helped Hopkins assemble such a strong group of researchers, since talented Jewish biochemists had few other options.&lt;ref&gt;Kornberg, ''For the Love of Enzymes'', pp. 312-313&lt;/ref&gt;

Stansby&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medicine and Surgery: a concise textbook, G. Kendall, K.Y. Shiu, S. L. Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingmedicine.com Thinking Medicine: Structure Your Knowledge for Success in Medical Exams, C. Koppel, A. Naparus]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Although there are several versions around the world with slight variations, the surgical sieve usually consist of the following types of process in the human body in any particular order:

* [[Congenital]]
* Acquired
** [[Vascular disease|Vascular]]
** [[Infection|Infective]]
** [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]tic
** [[Autoimmune disease|Autoimmune]]
** [[Metabolism|Metabolic]]
** [[Inflammation|Inflammatory]]
** [[Neurological]]
** [[Neoplasm|Neoplastic]]
** [[Degenerative disease|Degenerative]]
** [[Environmental disease|Environmental]]
** [[Idiopathic|Unknown]]
A more extensive, and perhaps more concise mechanism of employing the surgical sieve is using the mnemonic MEDIC HAT PINE:
* Metabolic (conditions relating to metabolism, biochemistry, and the like)
* Endocrinological (conditions relating to the various secretory systems within the body)
* Degenerative (conditions relating to age-related destruction of tissue, or stress-related destruction of tissue)
* Inflammatory/Infective (conditions that primarily present in a way that involves the profane activation of the immune system)
* Congenital (conditions present at birth)
* Haematological (conditions relating to the blood system, in one way or another)
* Autoimmune (conditions relating to the inappropriate activation of the immune system, in one of many ways)
* Traumatic (conditions relating to a physical response between two or more objects)
* Psychological/Neurological (conditions relating to the nervous system, in one way or another – whether that be the CNS or the PNS)
* Idiopathic/iatrogenic (conditions without a known cause, or without a known cause outside of medical intervention)
* Neoplastic (conditions relating to cancers)
* Environmental (conditions relating to exposures, and dose-response relationships thereof)

== Examples ==
What are the causes of an acute [[Mental confusion|confusional state]] in a patient?
# Treatment induced: [[polypharmacy]], sedatives, analgesics, steroids, drug withdrawal
# Vascular: [[stroke]], [[Transient ischemic attack|TIA]], [[vascular dementia]]
# Inflammatory: infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome
# Traumatic: head injury, [[Intracranial hemorrhage]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]
# Autoimmune: thyroid disease
# Metabolic: [[electrolyte imbalance]], [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|DKA]], [[hypoglycaemia]], [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone|SIADH]]
# Infective: [[sepsis]], local infection
# Neoplastic: [[brain tumour]], [[carcinomatosis]]
# Degenerative: [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[dementia]]

What are the causes of [[splenomegaly]]?
# Idiopathic: [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]]
# Vascular: [[portal vein obstruction]], [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]], [[haemoglobinopathies]] ([[Sickle-cell disease]], [[thalassemia]])
# Infective: [[AIDS]], [[mononucleosis]], [[septicaemia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[malaria]], [[infective endocarditis]]
# Traumatic: [[haematoma]], [[wikt:rupture|rupture]]
# Autoimmune: [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]
# Metabolic: [[Gaucher's disease]], [[mucopolysaccharidoses]], [[amyloidosis]], [[Tangier disease]]
# Inflammatory: [[sarcoidosis]]
# Neoplastic: [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]], [[metastases]], [[myeloproliferative disorder]]s

== Pathologic Basis Of Disease ==
Robbins ''Pathologic Basis Of Disease&lt;ref&gt;Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, R. S. Cotran, V. Kumar, T. Collins&lt;/ref&gt;'' is an internationally used reference textbook in [[pathology]]. Its chapters under the heading 'General Pathology' can be considered to be a version of the surgical sieve:

3. Acute and chronic ''inflammation''&lt;br /&gt;
4. Tissue Repair&lt;br /&gt;
5. ''Hemodynamic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
6. ''Genetic'' Disorders&lt;br /&gt;
7. Diseases of ''Immunity''&lt;br /&gt;
8. ''Neoplasia''&lt;br /&gt;
9. ''Infectious Diseases''&lt;br /&gt;
10. ''Environmental and Nutritional'' Pathology

==In popular culture==
The surgical sieve is frequently used by [[Gregory House]], who is a physician in the TV series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/house/ FOX Broadcasting Company: House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523030504/http://www.fox.com/house/ |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to diagnose the rare diseases that his patients are suffering from. In some episodes various forms of the surgical sieve are scribbled on to House's whiteboard while his team struggle to diagnose difficult cases. In the episode [[Paternity (House)|'Paternity']] the mnemonic 'MIDNIT' is used to run through the sieve (metabolic, inflammation, degenerative, neoplastic, infection, trauma).

'''Systematic political science''', as developed by [[Dallas F. Bell Jr.]], basically is the use of [[game theory]] methods to mathematically unify the anthropocentric academic disciplines of [[theology]], [[epistemology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[eschatology]] for computerized [[analysis]] and predictions after [[verification and validation]] methods are employed, such as [[red team]] procedures.  The discipline of systematic political science has two natural divisions of emphasis--pure and applied.  Pure (systematic) political science focuses on the parameters of individual, institutional, and societal behavior(s).  The behavioral parameters create probable decision-tree algorithms from a norm within the min max vector space sum, ∑.  Applied (systematic) political science applies the corresponding behavioral algorithms from pure political science to the subject(s) of analysis.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Transpersonal anthropology''' is a subdiscipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[transpersonal studies]]. It studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and [[culture]].

==Definition and context==
According to Walsh and Vaughan,&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt;Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. On transpersonal definitions. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psvchology'', 25:199-207, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed several definitions of the transpersonal field in the early 1990’s, «Transpersonal anthropology is the cross-cultural study of transpersonal phenomena and the relationship between consciousness and culture.» Charles Laughlin,&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"&gt; Laughlin, C. D. (2013). The ethno-epistemology of transpersonal experience: The view from transpersonal anthropology. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 32(1), 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of the field of Transpersonal anthropology, has defined the discipline as «the cross-cultural study of transpersonal experiences, including the sociocultural evocation, interpretation, and utility of transpersonal experiences, and their involvement in defining social roles».

As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref name="Young &amp; Goulet 1994"&gt;Young, David E. and J.-G. Goulet (1994) ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences''. Peterborough: Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"&gt; Sheppard, E. (2006) "Our worlds beyond." ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 10 ,(1):63-70. &lt;/ref&gt; has noted how transpersonal anthropology can be said to have begun in the USA in the 1970s. By the mid-eighties the discipline was described as a «young and growing field» by commentators.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'' 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; There was, by this time, also a development at the organizational level, in the form of the ''Association of Transpersonal Anthropology'', with  its supporting publication, the ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt; According to Hunter,&lt;ref name="Hunter 2015"&gt; Hunter, Jack. "Between Realness and Unrealness": Anthropology, Parapsychology and the Ontology of Non-Ordinary Realities. ''DISKUS'' 17.2 (2015), 4-20 (The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions)&lt;/ref&gt; the parallel field of [[Anthropology of Consciousness]] grew out of the transpersonal perspective, including Transpersonal anthropology.

Central to the development of the field has been the work of anthropologist [[Charles D. Laughlin]], who is considered to be one of the primary founders of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "&gt; Hartelius, Glenn. The Imperative for Diversity in a Transpersonal Psychology of the Whole Person. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 33(2), 2014, pp. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shepard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; also notes the contributions of Ihsan Al-Issa, &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"&gt;Al-Issa, Ihsan . (1995). "The Illusion of Reality and Reality of Illusion." ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 166 (3)368-373.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Turner (anthropology)|Edith Turner]],&lt;ref name="Turner 1996"&gt;Turner, Edith (1996) ''The Hands Feel It: Healing and Spirit Presence Among a Northern Alaskan People''. DeKalb, IL: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; wife of the anthropologist  [[Victor Turner]].

==Contributions to academic theory==
One of the  contributions of Laughlin to anthropological theory is a differentiation between so-called monophasic and polyphasic cultures. According to this theory polyphasic cultures are open to altered states of consciousness, and tries to integrate these experiences into their worldview, while monophasic cultures, typical  of technocratical societies, are largely closed to these alternative states of mind.&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "/&gt; Laughlin has published extensively on the topic of Transpersonal anthropology, and has addresses several issues within the field, including methodology.&lt;ref name="Laughlin MacManus Shearer 1983"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D., McManus, John and Shearer, Jon  (1983) "Dreams, Trance and Visions: What a Transpersonal Anthropology Might Look Like".  ''Phoenix:  Journal of Transpersonal Anthropology'' 7 (1/2):141-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1988"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1988) "Transpersonal Anthropology: Some Methodological Issues."  ''Western Canadian Anthropology'' 5:29-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994a"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Psychic Energy and Transpersonal Experience: A Biogenetic Structural Account of the Tibetan Dumo Practice," in ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences'' (ed. by D.E. Young and J.-G. Goulet).  Peterborough: Broadview Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994b"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Transpersonal Anthropology, Then and Now."  ''Transpersonal Review'' 1(1): 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994c"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Apodicticity:  The Problem of Absolute Certainty in Transpersonal Anthropology."  ''Anthropology &amp; Humanism'' 19(2): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Al-Issa &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"/&gt; has dealt with the topic of hallucinations, and the cultural aspects of them. Here, Al-Issa notes how not all cultures have negative views on hallucinations. Cross-cultural differences are noted by Al-Issa in sensory modalities most commonly encountered in hallucinations.

The field also includes the theories of anthropologist Dennis Gaffin whose contribution is a re-conceptualization of fairyology and the [[fairy]]-faith within the context of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Leykam 2013"&gt; Leykam, A. E. Book Review: Running with the fairies: towards a transpersonal anthropology of religion. ''Choice'' ; Middletown  Vol. 50, Iss. 6,  (Feb 2013): 1099. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2015"&gt; Butler, Jenny. Book Review: Gaffin, Dennis. 2013. Running with the Fairies: Towards a Transpersonal Anthropology of Religion. ''Fieldwork in Religion'', 10.2 (2015), 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheppard&lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; explains how Edith Turner's interpretations of her husband's field studies among the [[Ndembu]] in [[Zambia]] also can be interpreted as belonging to transpersonal anthropology, insofar as her interpretations of their [[healing ritual]]s were transpersonal.

==Criticism==

Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2007"&gt;Sheppard, E. (2007). Anthropology and the development of the transpersonal movement: Finding the transpersonal in transpersonal anthropology. ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 11(1) 59-69 {{ISSN|1366-6991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has published an article criticising transpersonal anthropology, at least as it has typically been practiced in contemporary scholarship. Her criticisms include its lack of a systematic conceptual base; its over-emphasis on shamanism; the difficulty in studying non-Western cultures that have been truly immune to Western influences and the question of the extent to which transpersonal anthropology has really addressed [[altered states of consciousness]].

The '''triangle of reference''' (also known as the '''triangle of meaning'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Cherry]] (1957) ''On Human Communication''&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''[[semiotics|semiotic]] triangle''') is a model of how linguistic symbols are related to the objects they represent. The triangle was published in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923) by [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]] (1923) ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  While often referred to as the "Ogden/Richards triangle" the idea is also expressed in 1810, by [[Bernard Bolzano]], in his ''Beiträge zu einer begründeteren Darstellung der Mathematik''.  However, the triangle can be traced back to the 4th century BC, in [[Aristotle]]'s ''Peri Hermeneias'' (often referred to in its Latin translation ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', second book of his ''[[Organon]]''). The Triangle relates to the [[problem of universals]], a philosophical debate which split ancient and medieval philosophers (mainly [[Platonic realism|realists]] and [[Nominalism|nominalists]]).

The triangle describes a simplified form of relationship between the speaker as '''subject''', a concept as '''object''' or referent, and its designation ('''sign''', signans). For more elaborated research see [[Semiotics]].

=== Other triangles ===
The relations between the triangular corners may be phrased more precisely in causal terms as follows{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}{{or|date=December 2012}}:

# The matter ''evokes'' the writer's thought.
# The writer ''refers'' the matter to the symbol.
# The symbol ''evokes'' the reader's thought.
# The reader ''refers'' the symbol back to the matter.

===The communicative stand===
Such a triangle represents ONE person, whereas communication takes place between TWO (objects, not necessarily persons). So imagine another triangle and consider that for the two to understand each other, the content that the "triangles" represent must fit or be aligned. Clearly, this calls for [[synchronisation]] and an interface as well as [[scale (ratio)|scale]] among other things. Notice also, that we perceive the world mostly through our eyes and in alternative phases of seeing and not seeing with change in the environment as the most important information to look for. Our [[eyes]] are [[Lens (anatomy)|lenses]]  and we see a surface (2D) in ONE direction (focusing) if we are stationary and the object is not moving either. This is why you may position yourself in one corner of the triangle and by replicating (mirroring) it, you will be able to see the whole picture, your [[cognitive]]  [[epistemological]] and the [[ontological]] [[existential]] or physical model of life, the universe, existence, etc. combined.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}{{or|date=December 2012}}

=== Direction of fit ===

[[John Searle]] used the notion of "direction of fit" to create a taxonomy of [[illocutionary act]]s.

Actually the arrows indicate that there is something exchanged between the two parties and it is a feedback cycle. Especially, if you imagine that the world is represented in both persons' mind and used for reality check. If you look at the triangle above again, then remember that reality check is not what is indicated there between the sign and the referent and marked as "true', because a term or a sign is allocated "arbitrarily'. What you check for is the observance of [[the law of identity]] which requires you and your partner to sort out that you are talking about the same thing. So the chunk of reality and the term are replaceable/interchangeable within limits and your concepts in the mind as presented in some appropriate way are all related and mean the same thing. Usually the check does not stop there, your ideas must also be tested for feasibility and doability to make sure that they are "real" and not "phantasy". Reality check comes from consolidating your experience with other people's experience to avoid [[solipsism]] and/or by putting your ideas (projection) in practice (production) and see the reaction. Notice, however how vague the verbs used and how the concept of a fit itself is left unexplained in details.{{Editorializing|date=December 2012}}

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Fig5.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|A pottery kiln within the glassworking cone. After the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.]] --&gt;

'''Verreville Glassworks''' was established on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]] in the village of [[Finnieston]] in 1777. Glass making was discontinued in 1842. The buildings of the works, including the 120 feet high glasshouse cone, were converted into a pottery works which remained in production until 1918.
[[File:Fig1.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of site under excavation. The River Clyde can be seen in the background. This area was the centre of major industry in Glasgow in the 19th and early 20th century.]]

In addition to a rich historical and documentary archive, evidence for the operations and technology of these industries was gained from excavations in 2005. The [[industrial archaeology|archaeological excavation]], carried out by [[Headland Archaeology]] uncovered several buildings and structures relating to both the glass and the pottery works.

==Historical background==

The Verreville Glassworks was established by a group of Glasgow merchants in 1777. Workmen were brought from England and Germany to build the cone, a major Glasgow landmark of its day, which reached a height of 120 feet. The company amalgamated with the Glasgow Bottlework Company in c. 1786 and in 1806 the business was sold to the Dumbarton Glass Company. The new business was immediately sold to John Geddes, on the condition that he did not make window glass or bottles.

John Geddes founded the '''‘Glasgow and Verreville Glass and Pottery Company’''', which quickly established itself and developed an export trade to North America and Ireland. However, pottery production was a very competitive market and Geddes was soon declared bankrupt. In 1830 the pottery was taken over by Robert Montgomery, a former manager. Montgomery’s involvement with the pottery was short-lived and by 1833 he too was declared bankrupt. The glassworks were closed in 1834.

The glassworks and John Geddes’ house and grounds (Verreville House) were bought by Robert Alexander Kidston who was a partner in the nearby Anderston Pottery (often called Lancefield Pottery). By this time the pottery had two earthenware kilns and one china kiln. Kidston tried to raise the quality of the products - he added the production of porcelain, imported Staffordshire workers and extended the works into the grounds of Verreville House – but by 1841 he himself was in financial trouble and the firm was taken over by a consortium, one of whom was Robert Cochran, whose family later owned the much larger Britannia Pottery in Glasgow. Glassmaking appears to have ceased production in 1842 and a number of small pottery kilns were built inside the original glassworks cone. Only white and earthenwares were being made by this time. The Cochran family remained in charge of the pottery until its eventual closure in 1918.

==Archaeological Excavations==
The [[Headland Archaeology|Headland excavations]] in 2005 revealed several features related to three major phases of development: glass manufacturing activity (c. 1777 – mid-1840s), pottery manufacturing phase (late 1840s – c. 1859) and the later pottery works (after c. 1859 – c. 1918).

===Glass Manufacturing Activity===
;The Glassworking Cone

The earliest phase of activity identified on site was associated with the [[glass production|production of glass]].  Evidence for the glass cone structure was identified by four evenly spaced brick built piers. These were constructed of hand made red bricks and formed a half circle in plan. It is probable that this is the remains of the northern half of the original octagonal glass cone structure built in 1777. These piers possibly supported an arcaded external wall, allowing access to the interior of the glass cone.

[[File:Fig7.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|Structures of the glass working buildings. The brick piers in the background are the remains of the northern half of the original glass cone structure.]]
Leading into the central area of the ‘glass cone’ was a series of [[flue]]s. The largest was constructed of hand made red brick with a vaulted ceiling. The interior of the brick was blackened by soot and the floor was blackened natural sand, which contained a large quaintly of broken glass or [[cullet]]. These flues would have pulled cold air into a central (unidentified) glass [[furnace]], obliterated by the post-1920s buildings.

;The Glassworking Hovel

The sub square building (hovel), which housed the glass cone was only identified by one wall during the excavation. Two lengths of hand made red brick wall, interpreted as the original northern wall of the hovel were excavated. Truncated by later stone pillar bases the fragmentary walls were upstanding to a height of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;m. The western wall fragment had a remains of a double archway – possibly an original entrance into the glass cone.

;The Fritting Floors

Two glass working ‘floor’ structures were identified. The northern structure was constructed of yellow [[refractory]] bricks with single coarse brick walls spaced at regular intervals.  The floor base was vitrified with a thick layer of melted glass covering it. The southern structure appeared to be of a similar construction although was heavily truncated. These structures have been initially interpreted as possible [[frit]]ting (or melting) floors for the primary production of melted glass.

===Pottery Manufacturing Activity===
;Yard Area
A heavily compacted surface of crushed flint covered the eastern area of the site. Several parts of the surface had been repaired by rounded cobbles and obvious areas of wear, including possible cart ruts, were apparent.

[[File:Fig3.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|The Pottery Drying Room. The brick floor with flues is exposed. Here, pottery was dried before being fired in the kilns.]]
;Pottery Buildings
Five buildings associated with pottery manufacture were identified during the excavation including a pottery drying room, workshops and furnaces.  These all appeared to date from the expansion of the pottery works c. 1820.

;The [[Kiln]]s
Six brick built kilns were identified during the course of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, were identified with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits – to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits.

Three kilns were situated within the probable location of the large circular glass cone, built in c. 1777.  Historical reference note that after the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.

===The Later Pottery works===
During the final 50 years of production existing buildings were adapted to new functions and new technology. [[Steam power]] was by now incorporated within the factory.

The archaeological evidence for the final phase of Verreville Pottery factory offers glimpses into the complex operations of [[pottery]] manufacturing such as processing, constructing, drying and firing of vessels. Clay would arrive into the area via a short gauge rail line in the warehouse. It would then be mixed by paddles in water (blunging), placed into tanks and put into the slip drying room to evaporate off the water. After this the clay would be thrown (wedged) to remove air bubbles and moulded or slip cast before placing into the pot drying room and finally into the kilns for firing.

Archaeological remains included a slip drying oven, a tunnel furnace and a pot drying room as well as evidence for modifications  to the warehouse, courtyard area and workshop and the removal of the rectangular oven.

'''Waste hierarchy''' is a tool used in the evaluation of processes that [[Environmental protection|protect the environment]] alongside [[resource consumption|resource]] and [[energy consumption]] to most favourable to least favourable actions.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite web|first1=Wenke |last1=Hansen |first2=Maria |last2=Christopher |first3=Maic |last3=Verbuecheln |date=December 2002| title=EU Waste Policies and Challenges for Local and Regional Authorities|url=http://ecologic.eu/sites/files/download/projekte/1900-1949/1921-1922/1921-1922_background_paper_waste_en.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy establishes preferred program priorities based on [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;  To be sustainable, waste management cannot be solved only with technical end-of-pipe solutions and an integrated approach is necessary.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental Protection Agency |date=2013|title=Non-Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy|url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''waste management hierarchy''' indicates an order of preference for action to reduce and manage waste, and is usually presented diagrammatically in the form of a pyramid.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Environmental Program |year=2013 |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities|isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy captures the progression of a material or product through successive stages of [[waste management]], and represents the latter part of the [[Product lifecycle|life-cycle for each product]].&lt;ref name=UNEP/&gt;

The aim of the '''waste hierarchy''' is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of waste.  The proper application of the waste hierarchy can have several benefits. It can help prevent emissions of greenhouse gases, reduces pollutants, save energy, conserves resources, create jobs and stimulate the development of green technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Waste-to-Energy Research and Technology Council |date=2009|title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.wtert.eu/default.asp?Menue=14&amp;ShowDok=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life-cycle thinking==

All products and services have [[environmental impact]]s, from the extraction of [[raw materials]] for production to manufacture, distribution, use and disposal.   Following the waste hierarchy will generally lead to the most [[resource-efficient]] and environmentally sound choice but in some cases refining decisions within the hierarchy or departing from it can lead to better environmental outcomes.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission|title=Life Cycle Thinking and Assessment for Waste Management|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/publications/pdf/Making_Sust_Consumption.pdf |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Product lifecycle|Life cycle]] thinking and assessment can be used to support decision-making in the area of [[waste management]] and to identify the best environmental options. It can help policy makers understand the benefits and trade-offs they have to face when making decisions on waste management strategies. [[Life-cycle assessment]] provides an approach to ensure that the best outcome for the environment can be identified and put in place.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It involves looking at all stages of a product’s life to find where improvements can be made to reduce environmental impacts and improve the use or [[reuse]] of resources.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  A key goal is to avoid actions that shift negative impacts from one stage to another.  Life cycle thinking can be applied to the five stages of the waste management hierarchy.

For example, life-cycle analysis has shown that it is often better for the environment to replace an old washing machine, despite the waste generated, than to continue to use an older machine which is less [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]. This is because a washing machine’s greatest environmental impact is during its use phase. Buying an energy-efficient machine and using low- temperature detergent reduce environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

The European Union Waste Framework Directive has introduced the concept of life-cycle thinking into [[waste policies]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  This duality approach gives a broader view of all environmental aspects and ensures any action has an overall benefit compared to other options.  The actions to deal with waste along the hierarchy should be compatible with other [[environmental initiative]]s.

== European Union waste framework directive ==

In 1975, The European Union’s [[Waste Framework Directive]] (1975/442/EEC) introduced for the first time the waste hierarchy concept into European waste policy.&lt;ref name=ECWaste&gt;{{cite web|author=European Commission |date=2014 |title=EU Waste Legislation |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312223737/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/legislation/a.htm |archivedate=March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized the importance of [[waste minimization]], and the [[Environmental protection|protection of the environment]] and [[human health]], as a priority. Following the 1975 Directive, European Union policy and legislation adapted to the principles of the waste hierarchy.

In 1989, it was formalized into a hierarchy of management options in the European Commission's Community Strategy for Waste Management and this waste strategy was further endorsed in the Commission's review in 1996.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web|author=Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs|title=Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy |publisher=gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the European Union parliament introduced a new ''five-step waste hierarchy'' to its waste legislation, Directive 2008/98/EC, which member states must introduce into national waste management laws.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt; Article 4 of the directive lays down a five-step hierarchy of waste management options which must be applied by Member States in this priority order.&lt;ref name=ECWaste/&gt;  Waste prevention, as the preferred option, is followed by reuse, recycling, recovery including [[energy recovery]] and as a last option, safe disposal. Among engineers, a similar hierarchy of waste management has been known as ARRE strategy: avoid, reduce, recycle, eliminate.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=197|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges for local and regional authorities ==
The task of implementing the waste hierarchy in waste management practices within a country may be delegated to the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to other possible factors including industry, private companies and households. Local and regional authorities can be particularly challenged by the following issues when applying the waste hierarchy approach.&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt; 
* A coherent [[waste management]] strategy must be set up
* Separate [[garbage collection|collection]] and [[waste sorting|sorting]] systems for many different waste streams need to be established.
* Adequate [[waste treatment|treatment]] and disposal facilities must be established.
* An effective horizontal co-operation between local authorities and municipalities and a vertical co-operation between the different levels of government, local to regional and when beneficial, also at the national level need to established
* Finding financing for the establishing or upgrading of expensive sustainable waste management infrastructure to address the needs of managing waste
* A lack of data available on waste management strategies must be overcome and monitoring requirements must be met to implement the waste programs
* The enforcement and control of business plans and practices be established and applied to maximize benefits to the environment and human health
* A lack of administrative capacity at the regional and local level. The lack of finances, information, and technical expertise must be overcome for effective implementation and success of the waste management policies.

==Source reduction==
[[Source reduction]] involves efforts to reduce [[hazardous waste]] and other materials by modifying industrial production. Source reduction methods involve changes in manufacturing technology, [[raw material]] inputs, and product formulation. At times, the term "pollution prevention" may refer to source reduction.

Another method of source reduction is to increase incentives for recycling.  Many communities in the United States are implementing [[variable-rate pricing]] for waste disposal (also known as Pay As You Throw - [[PAYT]]) which has been effective in reducing the size of the [[municipal waste]] stream.&lt;ref name="ecocycle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecocycle.org/zero/pay_throw.cfm|title=Pay-As-You-Throw - Let's Start|accessdate=2006-11-26|author=Mark Ruzzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source reduction is typically measured by efficiencies and cutbacks in waste. [[Toxics use reduction]] is a more controversial approach to source reduction that targets and measures reductions in the upstream use of toxic materials. Toxics use reduction emphasizes the more preventive aspects of source reduction but, due to its emphasis on toxic chemical inputs, has been opposed more vigorously by chemical manufacturers. Toxics use reduction programs have been set up by legislation in some states, e.g., [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Oregon]]. The 3 R's represent the 'Waste Hierarchy' which lists the best ways of managing waste from the most to the least desirable. Many of the things we currently throw away could be reused again with just a little thought and imagination.

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy?

McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]].

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent.

[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah.

*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G.

*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate.

*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.

[[File:Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Yamashina Institute for Ornithology]]
The {{nihongo|'''Yamashina Institute for Ornithology'''|山階鳥類研究所 |Yamashina Chōruikenkyūsho}} is a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|non-profit scientific research organization]] in [[Japan]], specializing in [[ornithology]] studies.

==History==
The Yamashina Institute for Ornithology was founded by Dr. [[Yoshimaro Yamashina]] at his home in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Tokyo]] as a private museum to store his collection of bird specimens and books. [[Marquis]] Yamashina was the second son of [[Prince Yamashina Kikumaro]]. He opened his museum to the public in 1942. At the Institute, Yamashina conducted research into bird [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] based on [[chromosomes]], and wrote numerous technical journal articles and books on ornithology.

The Institute relocated to its present location approximately 30 kilometer east of Tokyo at [[Abiko, Chiba]] in 1984. The Institute has maintained close ties to the [[Imperial Family of Japan]]. It is chaired by HIH [[Prince Akishino]], younger brother to the [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]] of Japan, and their younger sister [[Sayako Kuroda|Princess Sayako]] worked as a researcher at the Institute from 1992-2005, where she specialized in the study of [[kingfishers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article589235.ece] ''The Times'', Nov 12 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Institute is organized into three research sections:

*The '''Ornithology Research Laboratory''' specializes in the [[ecology]] and systematics of birds, including foraging patterns of marine birds and genetic variations of bird populations, mainly using [[DNA sequencing]].
*The '''Bird Migration Research Center''' conducts [[bird banding]] campaigns, tagging more than 200,000 birds each year. It also experiments with [[radio telemetry]], radar and satellite tracking to investigate [[bird migration|migratory patterns]].
*The '''Library and Collection Center''' maintains a collection of 69,000 different avian specimens from all over the world, especially from eastern Asia and the north-western Pacific regions and a library of 39,000 ornithological books and periodicals.

==Publications and events==
The Yamashina Institute publishes several journals and reports, including the ''Journal of the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology'', the annual ''Report of the Bird Migration Research Center'' and a monthly newspaper for support group members.

The Institute also sponsors a biannual ''Yamashina Yoshimaro Memorial Ornithological Award'' to an individual or group who has made remarkable contributions to the development ornithology or the protection of birds.

'''A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory''' ({{Lang-hy|Ա.Ի. Ալիխանյանի անվան Ազգային Գիտական Լապորատորիա}}) is a [[research]] institute, located in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. It was founded in 1943 as a branch of [[Yerevan State University]] by brothers [[Abraham Alikhanov]] and [[Artem Alikhanian]]. It was often referred to by the acronym Yerevan Physics Institute (YerPhI). In 2011 it was renamed as A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory.

==History and strategy==
The Yerevan Physics Institute was founded in 1943 as a branch of Yerevan State University by brothers Abraham Alikhanov and Artem Alikhanian. Later two high-altitude cosmic ray stations were founded on Mount Aragats (3,200 m) and Nor Amberd (2,000 m). [[File:YerPhI.jpg|thumb|The view of the Yerevan Physics Institute]]
In 1963 the institute was transferred to the Soviet Union Atomic Energy State Committee. The construction of a 6 GeV electron synchrotron accomplished in 1967 became an important landmark in the history of institute, it is the first particle accelerator in Armenia (Arus "ԱՐՈՒՍ"). After collapse of Soviet Union YerPhI continued research in the fields of high-energy physics and astrophysics in Armenia and worldwide using world biggest accelerators and cosmic ray detectors. Now YerPhI get status of A. Alikhanyan National Laboratory.

===Brief summary of scientific activities===
Among the key results of YerPhI in the early years were the discovery of protons and neutrons in cosmic rays, and the establishment of the first evidence of existence of the particles with masses between that of muons and protons. The high altitude research stations have remained the main research base of the Cosmic Ray Division (CRD) of YerPhI until now. Among the CRD achievements there were: discovery of sharp knee in light components of primary cosmic rays, detection of the highest energy protons accelerated on the Sun, and the creation of the Aragats Space environ¬mental Center in 2000 for studies of the solar-terrestrial connection, where CRD becomes one of the world’s leaders.

The 6 GeV electron synchrotron was accomplished in 1967. During 1970-1991 synchrotron was operated with energies up to 4,5 GeV and in Experimental Physics Division were obtained significant results, including: hadronic properties of photons in   π- meson photo-production on nuclei; structures of nucleon resonances in multi-polarization experiments, structure and characteristics of nuclear matter, important properties of X-ray transition radiation and channeling in monocrystals. Thanks to these achievements physicists from Yerevan Physics Institute started from 1985 are successfully participating in the large international collaborations.

Traditional topic of YerPhI is the development of new particle detectors. Wide spark chambers and transition radiation detectors are examples of the experimental techniques developed and implemented in YerPhI. During the last years groups of scientists from Yerevan Physics Institute have actively participated in intermediate and high energy physics experiments abroad (JLAB, DESY, CERN-LHC, [[MAX-lab]], MAMI), exploring the meson and nucleon structures, electromagnetic interactions of the nucleon, quark-hadron duality, short range nucleon-nucleon correlations, quark hadronization in nuclear medium, physics beyond standard model, Higgs boson searches, quark-gluon plasma, fission and fragmentation of nuclei and hypernuclei and many other topics, as well as constructing experimental hardware and develop the software for data acquisition and analysis.
The theoretical department assure major achievements in the following areas: B-meson physics, QCD and Related Phenomenology, Neutrino physics, Quantum Field Theory, String/M-theory, Integrable Models, Statistical physics, Condensed Matter and Quantum Information. These results are internationally recognized and highly cited.

In the mid-1980s in YerPhI was developed the concept of stereoscopic approach in Very High Energy gamma-ray astronomy using multiple Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). This concept was materialized in the very successful IACT system (HEGRA). After first success, Armenian physicists successfully participate in operation of the IACT systems on the Canary islands (MAGIC) and in Namibia (H.E.S.S.).
In the course of many years, the Applied Physics Department of YerPhI successfully investigates electron-energy structure of new wide-band laser materials using synchrotron radiation in various spectral regions. The investigations were carried in DESY and will be continued in MaxLab- II (Sweden).

Below are the integral parameters characterizing the efficiency of research conducted by national lab: number of publications and citations. The sizable enlargement of both parameters during last years is apparent. National lab scientists publish appr. 30% of scientific publications of Armenia. Most of publications appear in high impact factor journals; high quality of research in national lab is proved by citations – more than 60% of overall citations to papers published by scientists from Armenia belong to national lab.

==Structure==
The YerPhI has seven divisions and Computer Centre.

Experimental physics workshops are also parts of the institute. The main fields of research are:
* elementary particle physics
* nuclear physics
* cosmic ray physics and astrophysics
* theoretical physics
* condensed matter physics
* radiobiology
* Isotop investigation and production
* computer networking, computing
